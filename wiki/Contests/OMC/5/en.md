## Ruleset

### Rules

- This contest is for the osu! game mode only.
- Only Koreans are permitted to participate. If your profile flag is not showing that you're in Korea because of some reasons like foreign residence, you can still participate as long as you're able to verify that you are Korean.
- Contestants must only submit one difficulty. Additional difficulties won't be considered as your entry.
- The difficulty shouldn't be easier than Insane, otherwise the difficulty won't be considered as an entry.
- Storyboard and Video will not be considered for judging.
- Contestants must follow the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).
- You may be disqualified from the contest if:
  - You revealed your entry to others before results were announced.
  - You collaborated with another mapper on your entry.
  - You bribed one of the judges.
  - Your behaviour caused an issue (even if it wasn't related to this contest).

### Division system

- There are two divisions, a 'Pro' division and a 'Rookie' division.
- Contestants with a ranked mapset or a ranked GD of Insane or higher difficulty will be classified as a 'Pro' division contestant.
- Contestants without a ranked mapset or a ranked GD of Insane or higher difficulty will be classified as a 'Rookie' division contestant.
- The two rules above will be based off of the start of the Submitting Phase.
- Contestants may only compete within their respective divisions.
