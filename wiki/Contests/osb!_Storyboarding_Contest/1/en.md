## Ruleset

### General rules

- **You can choose any song, theme and sprites (including your own)**. This is so that we do not limit your potential and idea.
- **Mapping is not required**. This is a storyboarding contest!
- Use of **provided sprites is optional**, but it is **strongly encouraged since points are calculated with sprites and their usage**.
- If you get a **name change** during the duration of the tournament, please **let hosts know as soon as possible**!
- **No previous experience necessary**. (This includes experience with the beatmap editor's design tab, programming and photoshop, although it would be a great advantage.)
- Prizes are distributed in the span of 2 weeks after results have been released.

### Submission rules

- **This contest will be for individuals only.** This means storyboard collaboration is prohibited.
- If you want to use illustrations from an artist, **acquire permission / cite accordingly**.
- If you want to use sprites from other storyboards, **do not use them until you have permission from the storyboarder(s)**.
- Regarding how much you can edit a sprite with it still being counted as part of a sprite from the sprite pool, please refer to the image below.

- **Do not share storyboards, code, and/or sprites when you are done!** (This includes screenshots and/or GIFs of the storyboard.) Sharing them will put you in a disadvantage!
- You can get hints on making specific effects you have in mind, but **do not ask others to make an effect for you**!
- **If you already have WIP storyboard, you may use it in this contest.** However, we would like to see the SB you submit to us being used in a beatmap as well, without big modifications.
