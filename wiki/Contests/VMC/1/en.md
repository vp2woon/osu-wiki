The **Vocaloid Mapping Contest** (***VMC***) is a beatmapping contest all about promoting VOCALOID, UTAU, and other vocal synth songs and artists that have fallen through the cracks. Mappers were tasked with creating the best beatmap possible, and then having them judged by some of the most prominent VOCALOID mappers in the community.

## Ruleset

- **Submissions must be for the osu! ruleset only.** Comparing beatmaps of different modes in a judging scenario is unfortunately not realistic.
- **Submissions must use one of the [selected songs](#songs).**
- **Submissions must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Beatmaps should abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be disqualified.
- **Submissions must not be publicly revealed until after the results are announced.**
- **Excluding metadata, submissions must not include anything that could reveal your identity.** Metadata will be anonymised before submissions are relayed to judges.
- **Collaborations are not allowed**. This is a solo contest.
- **Submissions must not include storyboards or videos.**
- **Your submission must not have any edits to the .osu that would not be possible through the editor.** You are permitted to change any difficulty settings, backgrounds, green lines, SV, hitsounds, etc.
- **Your submission must have only one difficulty.**

## Judging criteria

| Position | Points | Description |
| :-- | --: | :-- |
| Relevance | 30 | How well does the map fit the song? Do the elements of the map match the elements of the song, and is the map fundamentally inseparable from the song it is paired with? |
| Creativity | 25 | How unique and outstanding is the map and the elements within it compared to the current mapping meta? How well does it stand out from the crowd? Does it evoke a feeling of "wow!", "that's cool!", or "that's super interesting!"? Generic mapping that copies the current mapping meta or concepts from other famous maps is discouraged. |
| Expertise | 20 | This refers to how well the map executes the elements it presents, encompassing the technical skills of the mapper, as well as the map's consistency, structure, and style. Judges will score this entry considering the overarching picture of the map, and will avoid nitpicking small details. |
| Overall Impression | 20 | The VOCALOID mappers participating as judges for this contest will all have personal biases with regard to how these songs are mapped. The judges will provide comments regarding the score they give. |
| Hitsounding | 5 | Rankable hitsounds can give up to 2 points, but hitsounds that fundamentally add to the experience and complement the map in a unique way can give the full 5 points. |

## Songs

Five (5) songs were selected from the Featured Artist library. These songs were selected based on several factors, such as whether they have been ranked in the past, or whether their inclusion would provide a variety of genres and artists to choose from.
