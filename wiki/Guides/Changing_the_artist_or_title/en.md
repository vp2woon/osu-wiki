*[Full Submission with Title/Artist Change -- Mistakes by NoHitter (hijacked by peppy)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/24443)*

When changing the **title or artist** in a map, a problem may occur in which you may not be able to submit it without making a duplicate map.

**Do not submit if the editor "Web" menu is disabled. Your map will duplicate.**

To fix a duplicating map, do the following:

- Easy Method (don't have any local changes):
  1. Delete local copy of map.
  2. Download copy from osu! website.
  3. Go into editor. Make sure the "Web" menu is enabled (not greyed out).
  4. Change the Artist/Title info.
  5. **Do not exit the editor.**
  6. Use `File` > `Open...` to change the Artist/Title in other difficulties.
  7. Full Submit.
- Hard Method (keep local changes):
  1. Go to the beatmap info page on the osu! site for your map.
  2. Open song setup for each difficulty and set the artist/title back to what is on the website.
  3. Go into Song Select and hit `F5`. Wait a few seconds.
  4. Go into editor. Make sure the "Web" menu is enabled (not greyed out).
  5. Change the Artist/Title info.
  6. **Do not exit the editor.**
  7. Use `File` > `Open...` to change the Artist/Title in other difficulties.
  8. Full Submit.

If you have any duplicated maps, please contact a member of the [NAT](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) for resolution.
