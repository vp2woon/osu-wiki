# Normal mod

*See also: [NM (disambiguation)](/wiki/Disambiguation/NM).*

A **normal mod** (*NM*) is a [mod](/wiki/Modding) that is provided without requiring any work from the requesting creator. Normal mods are typically done to get second opinions on a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) to help improve it. Many modders use the term "NM" to distinguish it from [mod for mod](/wiki/Modding/Mod_for_mod) exchanges.

Normal mods are most commonly requested on the forums in [modding queues](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60), where modders can personalise which kind of beatmaps they want to see, and mappers can find people willing to help them improve their beatmaps.
