# Kudosu

**Kudosu** is a reward system for [modding](/wiki/Modding). It awards points for successful mod posts in [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion). Accumulated points can be seen on a user's profile page.

Kudosu is awarded to mod posts that are helpful and point out useful suggestions for the beatmap. If a mapper believes that a mod post is useful and addresses a valid issue, they can click the thumbs up button and award kudosu to the user who posted the mod.

In [forum modding](/wiki/Modding/Forum_modding), kudosu used to be exchangeable for [star priority](/wiki/Modding/Star_priority).

Nowadays, kudosu is used for the evaluation of a user's capability to [become](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators/Becoming_a_Beatmap_Nominator) a [Beatmap Nominator](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators). A user must have 200 kudosu in osu! or 150 kudosu in osu!taiko, osu!catch, or osu!mania in order to apply.

The word *kudosu*, sometimes stylised as *kudosu!*, is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of *kudos* and *osu!*.
