# BAT Managers

**BAT Managers** (***BATm***) were the leaders of the [Beatmap Appreciation Team](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team) (*BAT*). They were responsible for managing and mentoring team members, as well as raising awareness of important announcements and shaping the future goals and direction of the team.

## History

[Ivalset](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/827) was promoted as the first BATm in early 2009. Later that same year he was replaced by [Pasonia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/43345). Their initial roles were to organise and execute BAT promotion.

### Triumvir Conglomerate

Following the promotion of all active members of the [Mapping Assistance Team](/wiki/People/Mapping_Assistance_Team) (*MAT*) to the BAT, on 2013-05-15, 3 new BATm were appointed from each major geographical region: ::{ flag=US }:: [Garven](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/244216) represented North America, ::{ flag=FR }:: [Kurai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/77089) represented Europe, and ::{ flag=CN }:: [NatsumeRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/151679) represented Asia. This three-way balance of power was coined as the Triumvir Conglomerate.

These regional BATm positions were replaced on 2013-12-22 with ::{ flag=US }:: [Charles445](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/85000), ::{ flag=DE }:: [Loctav](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/71366), and ::{ flag=CN }:: [popner](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/759860) until the separation of the BAT into the Beatmap Nomination Group (later the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators)) and the [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team) on 2014-08-21.
