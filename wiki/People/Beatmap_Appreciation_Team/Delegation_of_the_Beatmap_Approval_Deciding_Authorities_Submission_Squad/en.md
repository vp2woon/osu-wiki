# Delegation of the Beatmap Approval Deciding Authorities; Submission Squad

The **Delegation of the Beatmap Approval Deciding Authorities; Submission Squad (*BADASS*)** was the first forum-based selection method for new [Beatmap Appreciation Team (*BAT*)](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team) members. New members were previously added through informal votes in the game's `#bat` [IRC](/wiki/Community/Internet_Relay_Chat) channel, which did not receive enough visibility.

This initiative was led by [Ivalset](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/827), the [BAT manager](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team/BAT_Managers) at the time. It ran for nine cycles from 2009-03-09 through 2009-10-14.

When selecting new members, a group of leaders would select candidates and the remaining BAT would provide their opinions. Any users who received approval from at minimum 3 BAT members and the BAT manager with no disapproval from anyone would be promoted to the team.

Until the manual trial of [modding v2](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion) in 2014, all BAT promotion methods used similar ideas to the Delegation of the BADASS.
