# Account support team

*For a team that moderates certain subforums, see: [Technical Support Team](/wiki/People/Technical_Support_Team)*

**The account support team** is a group of people administering user accounts, as well as accepting silence and restriction appeals.

## Point of contact

The team can **only** be reached by sending a mail to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh), [support@ppy.sh](mailto:support@ppy.sh), [privacy@ppy.sh](mailto:privacy@ppy.sh), or [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto:tournaments@ppy.sh). The identities of its members are kept secret in order to protect them from unwanted attention.

It usually takes a few days for support to get to the email. If there is no response within a week, it is worth sending a follow-up message about the case.
