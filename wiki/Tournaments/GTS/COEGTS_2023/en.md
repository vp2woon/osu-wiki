### Registration

1. While there are no rank restrictions for this tournament, players wishing to participate must sign up on the [GTS website](https://gtsosu.com/coegts/home). Any osu!taiko player who has not been restricted within the past 12 months may participate.
2. Every player participating in this tournament, even the online qualifiers, must be able to attend [cavoe's osu! event 2023](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event/2023) for the full duration of the tournament. Having at least a midweek ticket (*BYOC* or *Spectator*) is recommended.
3. Players must log in to the GTS website with their osu! account, connect their Discord account, and join the [GTS Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/3mGC3HB). Both accounts must be used during the entire tournament and no change can be made after signing up.

5. No member of the tournament organisation may sign up for the tournament, with the exception of commentators.

### Qualifier instructions

1. During the qualifier, each participant will be given two attempts to set a high score on each map of the mappool. These attempts will be in lobbies scheduled during the weekend of 15 July 15 to 16 July.
2. The matches will start once the scheduled time is reached and a referee is present.
3. There will be no warm-ups during the match. The maps in the mappool will be played in order.
4. A short break is given between each map, the exact duration of which being at the discretion of the referee.
5. Rounds with disconnects within 30 seconds or 25% of the beatmap length, whichever happens first, may be replayed at the discretion of the referee, as long as the problem is clearly communicated in time.
6. The qualifier seeding will be based on the average placement of each player on each map. The top 16 seeded teams will advance to the main bracket.

### Main bracket instructions

1. The tournament proper consist of a single-elimination bracket, with an additional match deciding the third place. All matches will be direct 1v1 best-of-9 matches, except for the Finals match, which will be a best-of-13.
2. The match schedule is determined beforehand and cannot be changed. If a player cannot participate at the scheduled time the match will be forfeited, and a win by default will be handed to the other player if present. Any changes to the schedule will be announced in due time.
3. Participants may recheck and reconfigure their setup up to 15 minutes before the scheduled match time.
4. Once both players and a referee join a match, both players will begin by rolling, either physically or via the `!roll` command. Both players get to ban one beatmap during the match, starting with the loser of the roll. The players then alternate picks starting from the winner of the roll until either player gets enough points to win, or both players reach match point, in which case the tiebreaker is played.
5. Between each map there is a short break of 120 seconds during which the next map must be picked. If a player does not pick a map during that timespan, the referee will pick a random map from the mappool using `!roll X`, where X is the number of beatmaps that were neither picked nor banned, excluding the tiebreaker.
6. Rounds with disconnects within 30 seconds or 25% of the beatmap length, whichever happens first, may be replayed at the discretion of the referee, as long as the problem is clearly communicated in time.
7. Should a map end in a draw, the beatmap will be replayed before moving on to the next pick.
