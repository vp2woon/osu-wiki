## Ruleset

### General rules

- Beatmap scoring will be based on Score V2.
- Round of 16 and Quarterfinals will be played as BO9 with 1 ban per player.
- Semifinals and Finals will be played as BO11 with 2 bans per player.
- Grand finals will be played as BO13 with 2 bans per player.

### Match rules

The matches will proceed as follows:

- Two players will join a multiplayer room with supervision from an on-site tournament organizer.
- When both players are in the room and ready, the match will start.
- When the match starts, both users will `!roll` to determine the pick and ban order. The roll winner will choose either the pick order or the ban order, and roll loser will choose the remaining order. Bans will be done in ABBA order.
- Each player bans a Tiebreaker with an on-site tournament organizer, and the remaining Tiebreaker is selected. If both players ban the same Tiebreaker, the tournament organizer will `!roll 2` to select the Tiebreaker.
- Following the first map, the loser of the previous map will pick the next map until one player reaches the required amount of points to win the match.
- If both players are at match point, the Tiebreaker will be played.
