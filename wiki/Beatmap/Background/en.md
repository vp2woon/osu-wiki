# Background

*For regulations surrounding backgrounds, see: [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria)*

**Background** (***BG***) images and videos can be added to [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). When written only as "background" or "bg", it usually refers to the background image.

Backgrounds are displayed on beatmap cards, on the [song selection screen](/wiki/Client/Interface#song-select), and during gameplay. If difficulties on a beatmap have different backgrounds, the difficulty with the lowest [`BeatmapID`](/wiki/Beatmap#identification) is selected for its beatmap card and [beatmap carousel](/wiki/Client/Interface#beatmap-carousel) icons.
