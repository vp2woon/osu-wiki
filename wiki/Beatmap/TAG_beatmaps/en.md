# TAG beatmaps

*Not to be confused with tags, which are a [part of a beatmap's metadata](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Song_setup).*

**TAG beatmaps** (or just *TAG*) are beatmaps that are specifically made for [Tag co-op or Tag-team VS mode](/wiki/Client/Interface/Multiplayer#tag-co-op-/-tag-team-vs) in [multiplayer lobbies](/wiki/Client/Interface/Multiplayer). As such, these beatmaps often require cooperative play between two or more players in the lobby in order to be completed.

In these modes, each player is responsible for one [combo chain](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo), and throughout the song the players alternate between combo chains. For this reason, TAG beatmaps are often designed in such a way that their combo chains are placed very far apart from each other, making it nearly impossible for the beatmap to be cleared by a single player.

TAG [difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty) are most commonly denoted by the use of the term `TAG` in its difficulty name. Most often this `TAG` will be followed by a number, which typically denotes how many players the difficulty is meant for (e.g. `TAG2` for two players, or `TAG4` for four players).

Due to their nature, TAG difficulties are most commonly unranked, [Approved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved), or [Loved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#loved). However, on rare occasions, TAG beatmaps that follow the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria) and are deemed suitable for ranking by the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) may find their way into the [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) section.
