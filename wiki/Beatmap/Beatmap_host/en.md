# Beatmap host

A **beatmap host** is the manager and uploader of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap). They create the majority of a beatmap's difficulties and coordinate the creation of [guest difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap/Guest_difficulty). A beatmap host is usually responsible for finding [mods](/wiki/Modding) and contacting [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) to push their beatmap through the [beatmap ranking procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure).
