# HP drain rate

*For health as a gameplay mechanic, see: [Health](/wiki/Gameplay/Health)*\
*For regulations surrounding HP drain rate, see: [Ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria)*

**HP drain rate** (***HP***) is a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) difficulty setting that controls how much [health](/wiki/Gameplay/Health) is passively lost to [health drain](/wiki/Gameplay/Health). It also affects how heavily a player is penalised for missing notes and how much health is gained back by accurately hitting [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object).

HP ranges from 0 to 10, where 10 is the most punishing and 0 is the most lenient.<!-- TODO: quantify what the value actually means -->

## Mod effects

There are four mods that alter the HP drain rate when activated:

- [Easy](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Easy): Halves the HP value.
- [Hard Rock](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Hard_Rock): Multiplies the HP value by 1.4, up to a maximum of 10.
- [Double Time](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Double_Time): The HP value is not affected, but due to the 50% play speed increase, health drain occurs 50% faster.
- [Half Time](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Half_Time): The HP value is not affected, but due to the 25% play speed decrease, health drain occurs 25% slower.
