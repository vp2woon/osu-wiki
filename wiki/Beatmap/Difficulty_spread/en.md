# Difficulty spread

A **difficulty spread** is a set of [difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty) in a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) within some range of [star rating](/wiki/Beatmap/Star_rating) values.

[Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) beatmaps have several requirements regarding difficulty spreads as per the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria):

- All required [difficulty levels](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty#difficulty-levels) within the spread's range must be present.
- Difficulties lower than the lowest difficulty level required, as determined by the [spread rules](/wiki/Ranking_criteria#rules.1), are optional.
- No two adjacent beatmap difficulties may have a significant gap in difficulty.
