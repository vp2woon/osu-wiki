# Break

**Breaks** are sections of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) which have no [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object). During this time, [health drain](/wiki/Gameplay/Health) is temporarily halted. Breaks usually allow the player to rest their arm for a short while and reposition their [input device](/wiki/Gameplay/Input_device).

In all game modes except osu!mania, if there is enough time during a break, a passing or failing graphic and sound may appear to indicate if a player is doing well or not, together with current [grade](/wiki/Gameplay/Grade) at the top right corner of the screen. Additionally, breaks trigger letterboxes on background if the corresponding [beatmap setting](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Song_setup) is enabled.
