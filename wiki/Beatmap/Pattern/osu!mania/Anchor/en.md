# Anchor

**Anchors**, usually referring to a byproduct of [streams](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!mania/Stream) or sometimes [chordjacks](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!mania/Jack#chordjack), are a high concentration of notes in one column that appear consecutively within the same snap interval, typically 1/2. The name *anchor* comes from the hand motion the pattern creates, in which a finger is essentially anchored to a specific key due to the consecutive, intervallic presses.
