# Jack

**Jacks** typically refer to 3 or more consecutive notes within the same column. Jacks are typically snapped at a 1/4 snap interval or higher and tend to feature less notes overall, differentiating them from [anchors](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!mania/Anchor). Jacks often represent consecutive repeated sounds that occur in music.

They are referred to as **jacks** since the motion required to play them mimics the motion of a jackhammer.

## Minijack

A **minijack** is a type of jack which only features 2 notes and is the least demanding version of a jack.

## Longjack

A **longjack** is a more strenuous type of jack which uses 4 or more consecutive notes, typically isolated from any other pattern. This term may also be used when the same [jumps](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!mania/Chord#jump) or [hands](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!mania/Chord#hand) are used consecutively.

## Chordjack

**Chordjacks** feature a mix of different types of jacks along with [chords](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!mania/Chord). This term is typically only used for patterns denser than [quadstreams](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!mania/Stream#quadstream) and as such the more frequent usage of chords is emphasised.
