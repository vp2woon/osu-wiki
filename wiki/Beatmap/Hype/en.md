# Hype

Every [pending](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#wip-and-pending) [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) has a **hype train** that roughly represents how many people are interested in seeing the map [ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked). Users can post special [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion) in the `General (All difficulties)` tab with the `Hype!` option to contribute to a map's hype train.

## Ranking requirement

Beatmaps need at least 5 hype (one complete bar of the hype train) to be eligible for [nomination](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure#nominations), a step towards getting the map ranked.

## Limit

Users start with 10 hypes, and they are consumed when used on beatmaps. Each hype takes a week to become available again.
