# Genre and language

![A screenshot of genre, language, and tags on a beatmap page](img/beatmap-info.png "Genre and language are listed on beatmap pages.")

[Beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) submitted to the website have **genre** and **language** fields to help categorise songs. They are considered to be part of a beatmap's [metadata](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Song_setup#general).

Genre and language have no function in the game, but will be available as search options in [osu!(lazer)](/wiki/Client/Release_stream/Lazer).

The [beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) has filters available for genre and language in the `More Search Options` dropdown.

## Changing a beatmap's genre and language

Genre and language can be changed on the website by clicking the pencil icon when hovering over a beatmap's details. The ability to do so is determined by the user's [user groups](/wiki/People/User_group) and the beatmap's [category](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#present-categories):

- Mapset owners are allowed when the beatmap is in the [WIP](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#wip-and-pending), [Pending](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#wip-and-pending), or [Graveyard](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#graveyard) categories, and does not have any [nominations](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure#nominations).
- [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) are allowed when the beatmap is in the [Qualified](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#qualified), WIP, or Pending categories.
- [Project Loved Team](/wiki/People/Project_Loved_Team) members are allowed when the beatmap is in the [Loved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#loved) category.
- [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) and [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team) members are allowed for all categories.

A beatmap is unable to be [nominated](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure#nominations) if it has the `Unspecified` genre or language.
