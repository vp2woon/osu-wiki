# Beatmap collaborations

**Beatmap collaborations**, or ***collabs***, are single [difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty) or [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) with [guest difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap/Guest_difficulty) created by multiple people. While the term *collab* usually refers to beatmaps, it also means any other media created by several participants, such as [storyboards](/wiki/Storyboard) or songs.

## Description

Beatmap collaborations usually have the word "Collab" or multiple usernames attached to their difficulty name or [beatmap description](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmap_description), although it is not a strict [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria) requirement. It is also common for frequent collaborators to invent amalgamations of their usernames[^name-example] and use them consistently throughout their mapping careers.

The mapping process usually starts with the [beatmap host](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmap_host) splitting a pre-[timed](/wiki/Beatmapping/Timing) beatmap template into several parts by marking them on the [timeline](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Timelines) using bookmarks according to the song's musical structure. Relatively long segments, such as verses, are usually split after every 4 or 8 [measures](/wiki/Music_theory/Measure). These parts are then assigned to each collaborator according to some agreed-upon distribution, such as by even or odd segments in the case of two mappers.

Mappers complete their parts by laying out the [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object), applying [hitsounds](/wiki/Beatmapping/Hitsound), using [inherited timing points](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Timing#inherited-timing-point) where necessary, and then pass their work back to the host, who then combines the changes into a single difficulty by carefully editing its [`.osu` file](/wiki/Client/File_formats/osu_(file_format)).

Although mappers usually rely on the parts already completed to make gameplay transitions as smooth as possible, there exist so-called *blind collabs* such as [Mitose Noriko - Unreal Player](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/828563#osu/1735958) hosted by ::{ flag=DE }:: [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515), where the mappers cannot see each other's parts until the beatmap is finished. In such cases, hit objects are typically placed at the ends of each section beforehand to indicate where to continue from.
