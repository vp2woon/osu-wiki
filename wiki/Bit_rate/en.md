# Bit rate

*For regulations surrounding bit rate, see: [Ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria)*\
*For help re-encoding audio to a different bit rate, see: [Audio editing guide](/wiki/Guides/Audio_editing).*

**Bit rate** is a measurement of data throughput for a media file in units of bits over time. In osu!, this is relevant when talking about the quality of audio files: higher quality audio typically requires a higher bit rate, while lower quality audio can use a lower bit rate.

Bit rates of audio files typically range from 96kbps (kilobits per second) to 320kbps. The [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria) require that song audio is in the 128â€“192kbps range, and [AiMod](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/AiMod) will warn if this is not the case.
