# Brand identity guidelines

The brand identity guidelines is a set of standards for branding osu!-related projects. All use does not require approval.

[Download the design kit here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TmUot5nu49p71icz4u3G68njLAQOeQrG/view). The linked design kit contains some outdated assets. Also note that the included PDF is outdated and this page should be used instead.

## osu!

The name of the game, osu!, must not be capitalised or italicised. The osu! official branding must not use any spaces:

- Game modes: `osu!`, `osu!catch`, `osu!taiko`, `osu!mania`
- Projects: `osu!academy`, `osu!talk`
- Services and applications: `osu!direct`, `osu!store`, `osu!stream`, `osu!tourney`
- Products and goods: `osu!keyboard`, `osu!supporter`, `osu!tablet`

For all other terms, osu! must be treated as a [qualifying noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_adjunct), which means adding a space between osu! and the noun it modifies. Examples:

- `osu! tournaments`
- `osu! community`
- `osu! chat`
- `osu! client`
- `osu! wiki`

## osu! cookie logo

### Cookie usage restrictions

#### Single colour

![](img/usage-single-colour.png "Single colour osu! logo")

This is the single colour version of the osu! cookie logo. This version of the logo is very versatile and can be adapted to many design styles.

Please use the original file as the base, and do not create the logo from scratch.

#### Full colour

![](img/usage-full-colour.png "Full colour osu! logo")

This is the full colour version of the osu! cookie logo. The subtle drop shadow is part of the full colour logo.

Please use the logo as provided by the design kit without any modification.

### Clear space area

![](img/clear-space-area.png "Example of margins around the osu! logo")

Please give the cookie some breathing space. Use the "o" in "osu!" as the measurement of space.

### Single colour cookie usage restrictions

Since osu! is community-driven, the osu! cookie logo is designed to be simple and versatile; it can adapt to many designs with ease. There is no strict colour restriction to the colour of the cookie.

![](img/restrictions-good-single.png "Valid modifications of the single colour osu! logo")

- The cookie must be sharp at all times.
- You can use any colour for the cookie.
- You can add a linear gradient to the cookie. Radial gradients are not recommended as the ring and the middle element might appear in completely different colours.
- You may mask an artwork as a texture for the cookie; however, the cookie must maintain a good contrast with the background.
