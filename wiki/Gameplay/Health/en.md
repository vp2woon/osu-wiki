# Health

**Health** or *HP*, is the value that determines if a player has passed or failed a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap). Health can be seen in the [health bar](/wiki/Client/Interface/Health_bar), which updates as gameplay progresses. The [HP drain rate](/wiki/Beatmap/HP_drain_rate) difficulty setting determines how difficult it is to keep a high health value.

## osu!

In [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!), health will decrease at a steady rate called health drain, but can be replenished by hitting notes at the right time or spinning spinners.

Score bursts will appear after tapping hit circles, changing score and health values depending on the accuracy of the hit. A perfectly timed hit (300) will recover more health than a badly timed hit (50). Players also receive larger boosts if they achieve a katu or a geki at the end of a combo. A miss will drain health instead. If spinners are cleared early, continuing to spin will gain additional health back. For an overview of health recovery and health loss see below:

Health recovery:

- A successful tap on the hit circle (better [judgement](/wiki/Gameplay/Judgement) leads to more health gain; the last hit circle in a colour combo awards more health)
- A successful tap on a slider start
- The slider ball collected a slider tick successfully
- The slider ball touched the slider end or a reverse arrow successfully (better judgement at the end tick leads to more health gain)
- Completing a spinner and continuing to spin (better judgement at the end of the spinner leads to more health gain)

Health loss:

- Health drain
- Missing a hit circle
- Tapping a slider head early
- Missing a slider tick, or slider reverse arrow
- Failed to achieve at least a 50 on a spinner

No effect:

- Break time

## osu!taiko

In [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko), the health bar starts off empty and must be filled 50% or more to pass a beatmap. This is done by tapping the correct combination of keys in sync with the beat.

Score bursts will appear after hitting notes, changing score and health values depending on the accuracy of the hit. A perfectly timed hit (300) will recover more health than a badly timed hit (50). Players also receive larger boosts if they achieve a katu or a geki at the end of a combo. A miss will drain health instead. Failing to complete a denden will result in health loss. Drumrolls can be ignored with no health penalty as they have no influence on the health bar. For an overview of health recovery and health loss see below:

Health recovery:

- Getting 'Great' or 'Good' on small/large notes

Health loss:

- Getting 'Miss' or 'Bad' on small/large notes
- Not completing Dendens
- Not completing Shakers

No effect:

- Doing drumrolls
- Ignoring drumrolls
- Completing Dendens
- Completing Shakers

*Note: It is entirely possible for a beatmap to never pass by design due to it only containing drumrolls and/or dendens/shakers.*

## osu!catch

In [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch), health will decrease at a steady rate called health drain, but can be replenished by catching fruits and drops.

Score bursts will appear after catching fruit, changing score and health values depending on the hit object caught. The player also receives larger boosts if he catches the end of a combo resulting in a geki. Missing fruit will drain health instead. Bananas can be ignored with no health penalty. For an overview of health recovery and health loss see below:

Health recovery:

- Collecting any fruits, juice drops, or bananas

Health loss:

- Health drain
- Missing fruits or juice drops

No effect:

- Break time

## osu!mania

In [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!mania), only hit objects will affect the health bar, as health drain is disabled.

Score bursts will appear after hitting notes, changing score and health values depending on the accuracy of the hit. A perfectly timed hit (300) will recover more health than a badly timed hit (50). A miss will drain health instead. Health bar regeneration occurs slowly while holding hold notes. For an overview of health recovery and health loss see below:

Health recovery:

- Getting Rainbow 300, 300, or 200 (from most-to-least gained)
- Holding the hold note with correct key

Health loss:

- Getting 50 or Miss
