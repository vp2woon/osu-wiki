# Hyperdash

The **hyperdash** is a term used in [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch) for the movement which is done when a [hyperfruit](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Hyperfruit) is generated. While modding beatmaps, people tend to link the hyperfruit and the target [active object](/wiki/Beatmapping/Active_object) to define a hyperdash movement (e.g. `00:01:000 (1,2) -`  where 1 is the hyperfruit, and 2 the target active object).
