# Fruit

*Fruits* are large coloured [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) present in [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). A [hyperfruit](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Hyperfruit) will be generated on a fruit once the next fruit or [drop](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Juice_stream#drop) is uncatchable by normal dashing.

Successfully catching a fruit will earn the player [score](/wiki/Gameplay/Score), increase the [combo](/wiki/Gameplay/Combo_(score_multiplier)) by 1, provide a boost to the [health bar](/wiki/Client/Interface/Health_bar), and is treated as 300 in the result screen. If the player fails to catch a fruit it will result in a [combobreak](/wiki/Gameplay/Judgement/Combobreak) and a loss in [health](/wiki/Gameplay/Health).
