# Slider anchor

*Slider anchors* or **anchor points**, change the shape of [sliderbodies](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider/Sliderbody). There are two different types of anchors; white and red anchors. White anchors create smooth curves and will affect other white anchors until the slider either ends or a red anchor is placed. Red anchors are stopping points and can be used to create sharp angles.<!-- TODO: Insert curve algorithm in here somewhere maybe-->
