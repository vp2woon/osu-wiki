# Slidertail

*Slidertail* or **sliderend**, refers to the ending portion of a [slider](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider) where the player can release their pressed key after having followed a [sliderbody](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider/Sliderbody). Slidertails are only found in [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). Slidertails can be either fully visible as a circle or invisible as part of the sliderbody, depending on which version your [skin](/wiki/Skin) is using. The colour of slidertails is determined by the combo colours used by the mappers of a beatmap.
