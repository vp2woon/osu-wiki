# Banana

*Bananas* are bonus [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) present in [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). Bananas get generated when a [spinner](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Spinner) is placed in the editor. Compared to a spinner they don't have to be cleared as each banana is optional to catch.

Successfully catching a banana will increase the [score](/wiki/Gameplay/Score) with 1100 points without taking [combo](/wiki/Gameplay/Combo_(score_multiplier)) into account, and they also provide a boost to the [health bar](/wiki/Client/Interface/Health_bar).
