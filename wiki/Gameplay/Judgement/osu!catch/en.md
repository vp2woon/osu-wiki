# osu!catch judgement system

## Hit values

A **judgement**, or **hit result**, is the outcome of interacting with a [hit object](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) during its hit window. osu!catch is different from the other game modes in that there is no concept of timing or hit windows, which means everything is judged as either hit or missed.

## Judgement mechanics

- Accuracy in osu!catch is calculated as the ratio of fruits, drops, and droplets caught.
- Fruits and drops increase combo and cause misses, while droplets and bananas have no effect.
