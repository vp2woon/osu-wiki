# Slider break

**Slider break** (sometimes abbreviated as *SB*) is the act of breaking [combo](/wiki/Gameplay/Combo_(score_multiplier)) by not fully completing a [slider](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider). It occurs when either the [head](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider/Sliderhead) or one of the [ticks](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider/Slider_tick) of a slider are missed.

Slider break will not be triggered if the slider's [tail](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider/Slidertail) is skipped, or if the active key is released over a part of the slider's [body](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider/Sliderbody) devoid of slider ticks. The latter property of a slider's lenience is exploited in the 2B maps<!-- TODO(TicClick): when the article is added, link it here -->, which contain concurrent sliders and [circles](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Hit_circle).

## Gameplay

Slider breaks, by their definition, break combo, but instead of a miss, the player will receive a [GOOD](/wiki/Gameplay/Judgement/osu!). As a result, it's still possible to get the S or silver S [grade](/wiki/Gameplay/Grade) for a play, assuming that all other [accuracy](/wiki/Gameplay/Accuracy) requirements have been met.
