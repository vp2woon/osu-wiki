# Combobreak

**Combobreak** is a term used to describe a player losing their [combo](/wiki/Gameplay/Combo_(score_multiplier)) during any part of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap). By default, they will play a "combobreak sound" if the player has broken a combo of 21x or higher. And if enabled in the settings, a combo burst image will appear at certain [milestones](/wiki/Gameplay/Combo_milestone).

There is no in-game option to disable the combobreak sound effect. Players who do not want to hear the combobreak sound may replace the `combobreak.wav` file with a blank or silenced `.wav` audio file.
