# Ranked score

*For other uses, see [Score (disambiguation)](/wiki/Disambiguation/Score).*

The **ranked score** is the total sum of the best scores for all ranked, loved, and approved [difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty) played online.

## History

Prior to [ppv1](/wiki/Performance_points/ppv1) and [ppv2](/wiki/Performance_points/ppv2), a player's [rank](/wiki/Ranking) was determined by the amount of ranked score the player had, thus resulting in frequent #1 changes due to how small the osu! community was at the time and the lack of maps. Ranked score was fully replaced by ppv1 as of July 24, 2012, which was later to be replaced by ppv2 on January 27, 2014.

Beatmaps that exceeded length and maximum score requirements on older renditions of the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria) were able to instead be moved into the [Approved category](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved). Such beatmaps did not award ranked score at the time, but instead awarded [total score](/wiki/Gameplay/Score/Total_score) and [performance points](/wiki/Performance_points).
