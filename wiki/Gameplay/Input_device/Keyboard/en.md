# Keyboard

A **keyboard** is the most common input device used to play osu!. By default, the `Z` and `X` keys are set for clicking, but they can be changed to any keys of your choice in the osu! options.

## Keypad

A **keypad** is a miniature keyboard with a limited set of keys. Keypads are popular in osu! because of their small size and amount of keys, usually 2 or 4.
