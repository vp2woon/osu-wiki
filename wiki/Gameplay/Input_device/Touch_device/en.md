# Touch device

*See also: [Play style](/wiki/Gameplay/Play_style)*

A **touch device** is a device with touchscreen that allows the user to interact with the computer using their fingers. osu! supports touch devices natively. You can tap the screen to aim and click at the same time. Touch devices most often come in form of touchscreen laptops, higher-end graphics tablets, or smartphones.

If a touch device is used to play an osu! game mode map and the play is submitted, a mod indicating usage of a touch device will be applied automatically.
