# Graphics tablet

*See also: [Play style](/wiki/Gameplay/Play_style)*

![](img/tablet.jpg "Graphics tablet")

A **graphics tablet**, or just *tablet*, is an input device that is originally intended for digital drawing and artistry, but can be used as a way to control cursor movement in [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!). It is one of the most common play styles in osu!.

*Note to tablet players: the use of a Tablet PC or tablet clicks in osu! may sometimes be handled incorrectly. In order to fix this, enable the `OS Tablet PC support` setting in the Options menu.*
