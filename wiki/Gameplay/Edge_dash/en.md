# Edge dash

The **edge dash** (also known as a *pixel dash*) is a term used in [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch) for a very large spacing between two [active objects](/wiki/Beatmapping/Active_object) when the required [trigger distance](/wiki/Beatmapping/Trigger_distance) is not reached, and as such, a [hyperfruit](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Hyperfruit) is not generated to create a [hyperdash](/wiki/Gameplay/Hyperdash). The first object must be caught with the edge of the plate in order to catch the second object at all.
