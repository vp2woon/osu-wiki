# Hover

**Hovering** is a term used to describe the act of navigating (or "aiming") a [tablet](/wiki/Gameplay/Input_device/Graphics_tablet) pen across a tablet by holding the pen above the surface of the tablet while still inside of the active hover zone. Thus you are "hovering" the pen above the tablet. This is a method of pen navigation in opposition to [dragging](/wiki/Gameplay/Play_style/Drag). It can be found across players of all skill levels, although it is most often associated with highly skilled players.

Arguments in favour of hovering often claim that it reduces/removes the need to buy replacement nibs, removes the need for a tablet cover, and is (technically) "faster" due to a lack of friction. Whereas arguments against hovering often claim that it is much more difficult to accurately stop or turn on [jumps](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!/Jump) and right angles.
