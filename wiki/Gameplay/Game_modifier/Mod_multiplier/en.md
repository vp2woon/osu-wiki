# Mod multiplier

*Not to be confused with [Combo](/wiki/Gameplay/Combo_(score_multiplier))*\
*See also: [Game modifier](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier)*

## Description

The **mod multiplier** is one of the multipliers which affects the [score](/wiki/Gameplay/Score) value of a single [hit object](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) throughout gameplay.

By default, the mod multiplier equals to 1.00x, however, if several [mods](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier) are enabled, the final value is a product of respective mod multipliers. For example, if [Hard Rock](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Hard_Rock) and [Half Time](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Half_Time) are enabled simultaneously in osu!, the final value would be 0.318x.

## Trivia

- The mod multiplier is shown on osu!(stable)'s [mod selection screen](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier) as `Score Multiplier`, while in [osu!(lazer)](/wiki/Client/Release_stream/Lazer) it is called `Difficulty Multiplier`.
- osu! used to round down the mod multiplier to the nearest hundredth until a patch<!-- in (year)--> fixed the rounding problem by only rounding up if the thousandths value is 0.005 or higher.
