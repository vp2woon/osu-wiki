## Description

*Notice: Enabling the Co-op mod will result in an unranked play.*

The **Co-op** mod is a [game modifier](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier) for [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!mania) that introduces a second playfield with a second set of controls based on the current *x*K count (e.g. 7K -> 7K + 7K = 14K). For osu!mania-specific [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap), the *x*K is split to half (e.g. 7K -> 4K + 3K = 7K).
