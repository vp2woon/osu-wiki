# Spinner trap

A term used in [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch) when the [fruit](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Fruit) directly after a banana shower<!-- TODO: link --> (the osu!catch equivalent of the [spinner](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Spinner)) is not easily accessible naturally. Several things may cause this:

- The next fruit is on the outer edges of the playfield.
- The next fruit is placed at an unreachable distance from the last [banana](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Banana) in the optimal catching path.
- The next fruit is obscured by bananas.
