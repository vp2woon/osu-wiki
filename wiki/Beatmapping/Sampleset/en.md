# Sampleset

A **sampleset** is the collection of sound effects that are heard during gameplay.

There are three types of hitsounds:

- Normal
- Soft
- Drum

Of these types, there are three different hitsound additions that are played over the default *normal* hitsound:

- whistle
- finish
- clap

A *normal* hitsound is used by default when any of the above samplesets are in-use.

Other parts of a sampleset may include the slider tick sounds and the sound made when filling the spinner metre.
