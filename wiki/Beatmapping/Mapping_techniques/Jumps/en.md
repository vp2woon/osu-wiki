# Jump mapping techniques

*See [Mapping techniques/Basics](/wiki/Beatmapping/Mapping_techniques/Basics#jumps) for a description on jumps.*

<!-- please place all mapping techniques in alphabetical order -->

## Hit Circle

### Anti-Jumps

Nominator: [Seibei4211](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/31537)

**Anti-Jumps** consist of a normal set of placed hit objects, followed by a stream of notes with half the spacing (placed closer) than the previous comboset.
This part could be a separate comboset.

### Anti-SeibeiStyle-Jumps

Nominator: [Seibei4211](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/31537)

**Anti-SeibeiStyle-Jumps** consist of a beat stream with a few beats with the same spacing further apart on the timeline than the others in the same combo.

Basically, hit objects are placed to have the appearance of a constant beat; however, timeline-wise, they are spaced a bit further apart.

### Centre Anti-Jumps

Nominator: [NoHitter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124455)

**Centre anti-jumps** have a note or a slider placed in the centre while the other hit objects but are spaced the same in the timeline as a form of an [anti-jump](#anti-jumps).

### Large Jumps

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

### Oibon Jumps

Nominator: [Zekira](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/36749)

**Oibon jumps** are jumps from the left side of the screen to the right side (or vice versa).

## Slider

### B&F Sliderbased Jumps

Nominator: [Blue Dragon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)

**B&F sliderbased jumps** consist of making a [back and forth](/wiki/Beatmapping/Mapping_techniques/Rhythm#back-and-forth-beats) jump (or triangle) using the slider as the base for the jump.

### Endpoint Slider Jumps

Nominator: [Lybydose](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/64501)

**Endpoint slider jumps** use two sliders, and a hit circle.
A slider is mapped, followed by a hit circle, followed by a horizontally-flipped copy of the slider.

### Orbital Sliders

Nominator: [Card N'FoRcE](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3936)

**Orbital sliders** use mirrored sliders with a note in the middle.

This usually uses a beat long slider.
This is followed by a hit circle that is half the beat of the first slider, a beat afterwards.
This is then followed by another beat long slider that is half the beat of the hitcircle.
