# Stack

![](img/stack.jpg "An example of two hit circles stacking on top of a slider head.")

A **stack** is a set of [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) that [overlap](/wiki/Beatmapping/Mapping_techniques/Overlap) each other in the playfield<!-- TODO: link -->. The most common objects that are stacked are [hit circles](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Hit_circle).

Stacks are automatically created when hit objects are close to perfectly overlapping each other. The time between objects for this to occur is determined by the beatmap's [stack leniency](/wiki/Beatmap/Stack_leniency).
