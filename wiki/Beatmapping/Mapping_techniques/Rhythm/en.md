## Spacing

### 15 Degree Patterns

Nominator(s): [grumd](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/530913)

**15 degree patterns** is a slider exclusive technique.
You start off by mapping a section with only horizontal and vertical sliders.
Then rotate them 15 degrees clockwise or anti-clockwise.

This basically adds a more style to a group of sliders.

Angles between 10 and 80 degrees can also be used.

#### Tutorial

1. Find a section in your beatmap that only contains horizontal (left and right) and vertical (up and down) sliders.
   - These sliders should not have any curves.
2. Select those sliders by either `Ctrl` + clicking on them or by dragging along the timeline.
3. Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `R`.
   - Or click on `Edit` (near the top left) then `Rotate by...`.
4. Enter `15` (or any number between 10 and 80) in the text box.
   - You can choose either `Clockwise` or `Anti-Clockwise`, it doesn't really matter.
5. Click `OK`.
6. Voil√†, your done!

### Accelerated Spacing

*Not to be confused with [Spacing Out](#spacing-out).*

Nominator(s): [Gabi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/57057)

**Accelerated spacing** is where the distance of each hit object is placed farther and farther apart, while the timing between them remains the same.

### Back and Forth Beats

Nominator(s): [kingcobra52](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9934)

**Back and forth beats** are comprised of two stacks of beats (or more), with the odd notes in one stack and even notes in the other.
Using this requires the player to alternate between the two stacks.

It is encouraged to only be used for harder difficulties as this can be hard for newer players.

### Differential Stacks

Nominator(s): [NoHItter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124455)

**Differential stacks** consist of notes that are spaced apart inconsistently from each other in the timeline.
A notable thing is that these objects are mapped as if they are a consistent beat.

Some sightreading may be required unless you can really follow the music.

When playing a beatmap using this technique, it can be very challenging to play with the hidden game modifier.

### Drain Sections

Nominator(s): [SapphireGhost](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/388602)

**Drain sections** is a section in a beatmap that suddenly becomes *slower* or *less difficult* in an attempt to either match the song better or cause the HP bar to drain.

This can be done by placing less notes and/or slowing the slider speed.

Drain sections should be used sparingly and only when the song may *hint* it.

### Half-Backing

Nominator(s): [Ekaru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17938)

**Half-Backing** is comprised of a quarter beat followed by two-eighth beats, arranged similarly to [back and forth beats](#back-and-forth-beats) except the third note stops.
This will create a straight line.

### Hub and Spoke

Nominator(s): [Beuchi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/67192)

The **hub and spoke** formation is literally a hub with spokes peaking out.
This technique requires at least 8 to 9 hit objects that are half a beat apart from another.
Using this will force the player to not only move in a circular direction but also require them to return back to the centre after an object was hit.
In general, this is basically the [QQ diamonds](/wiki/Beatmapping/Mapping_techniques/Formations#qq-diamonds) technique with a centre for every other hit object.

First, place the odd numbered combos in the centre of where the hub and spoke is to be mapped (this part is the "hub").
The following, even, hit objects are to then be placed 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees (or vice versa) surrounding the "hub" (these are the "spokes").

It is very important to lay the hit objects out so that they go in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.

The basic form of the Hub and Spoke uses 4 spokes.
You could, however, use 3, 5, or 6 spokes instead (when you do this, make sure that the degree measure remains equal for each spoke).

### Linear Back and Forth

Nominator(s): [Derekku](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/91341)

**Linear back and forth** is a variation of the [back and forth beats](#back-and-forth-beats) spreads.
The difference is that there these don't use stacks rather, they require the player to move along back and forth between the hit objects.
It is very important that the mapper makes it clear as to the direction of where the spread is heading.

### Spacing Out

*Not to be confused with [Accelerated Spacing](#accelerated-spacing)*

Nominator(s): [Pasonia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/43345)

**Spacing out** refers to hit objects in which they are placed distance-wise, not time.
This technique has the advantage of keeping a momentum in a tune running during that section of a map.
However, incorrect patternmapping can lead to an almost unplayable map.

Basically, form a square around the centre with 4 hit circles.
The next 4 hit circles are then to be placed 1 grid space outwards and so on.

Another varient you can add is to place a hit circle in the centre after each cycle.

### Step-Too-Fars

Nominator(s): [OzzyOzrock](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/465153)

**Step-Too-Fars** uses a linear path of hit circles that are a quarter beat apart.
However, upon hitting the "end" of the line, the hit objects moves back one space (the hit circle before the line had ended) then changes direction.

## Speed

### Slider Slowdowns

Nominator(s): [123MegaApple123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2148208)

**Slider slowdowns** abruptly slows down a slider by temporarily halving an inherited timing point (the green ones) to complement the music's (or vocals') long note.

## Streams

*See [Mapping techniques/Basics](/wiki/Beatmapping/Mapping_techniques/Basics#streams) for a description on streams.*

### Compressed Streams

Nominator(s): [pieguyn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/107485)

**Compressed streams** uses hit circles that are only 3 grid spaces apart (on a 2 or 3-grid level).
Otherwise, just make the stream considerably smaller compared to the rest of the map.

A majority of maps that uses streams are most likely to be seen using compressed streams.

### Discontinuous Streams

Nominator(s): [benguin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1322807)

**Discontinuous streams** is when there is a *jump* in the stream even if the timing between the notes in the jump are the same length as the timing between notes in the rest of the stream.

### Deathstreams

Nominator(s): [NoHItter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124455)

**Deathstream** are *very* long and difficult streams.
These consist of sliders (with or without repeats), hit circles or a combination of both.

The job of a deathstream is to practically fail players that cannot handle ordinary streams.

During the [score ranking](/wiki/Ranking#score-ranking) era, the use of deathstreams was strictly limited as the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria) would only allow for a Ranked beatmap to have a maximum score of 20 million. However, with the introduction of the [pp system](/wiki/Performance_points), the score cap rule was soon rendered moot and deathstreams saw a tick up in its usage as a result.

### Slider Stream Jumps

Nominator(s): [dkun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/154400) and [MMzz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/128993)

**Slider stream jumps** is a more advanced technique for osu!.
Instead of using an orthodox stream, you replace it with sliders.
This keeps the same stream difficulty, as you need to move and click rather than just following a stream.

Essentially, you jump with your cursor and stream, hence the term *Slider Stream Jumps*.

### Triplet Streams

Nominator(s): [Lybydose](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/64501)

**Triplet Streams** uses a set of three hit circles that requires to be tapped in a quick succession.
These are commonly placed in a 1/4 beat snap divisor depending on BPM of the map.

They can come in a single succession or multiple depending on what the mapper wishes.

Note, Triplet Steams does **not** refer to an actual triplet in [music theory](/wiki/Music_theory).

### Variable Spaced Streams

Nominator(s): [fartownik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/56917)

**Variable spaced streams** use longer streams with inconsistent distance snap (usually increasing).

### Zig-Zag Streams

Nominator(s): [Daru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/32480)

**Zig-Zag streams** are streams with hit objects placed in such a manner that they form a very jagged line.
However, they are placed very closely that they can be passed by moving the cursor through them in a straight line which intersects all notes.
These are most commonly found with notes *zig-zagging* across one another.
