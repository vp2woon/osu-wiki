## Additional Effects

### Post-Spinner Note

Nominator(s): [NoHItter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124455)

The **post-spinner note** is made up of a hit object after a long spinner.
This is usually placed at the end of the song.

### Pre-Spinner Note

Nominator(s): [NoHItter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124455)

The **pre-spinner note** is made up of a hit object that is placed directly before a spinner.
This hit object gives the *beat* while the spinner provides resolution to that *beat*.
The spinner usually follows 1/2, 1/3/ 1/4 or 1/6 of a beat after to not sound disjoint from the hit object.

Earlier maps may overlap these hit objects and the spinner.
**However, overlapping these will make your map unrankable!**

## Spinner Variation

### Double Spinners

Nominator(s): [Lilac](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/58197)

**Double spinners** are pretty self-explanatory.
This is where two spinners are placed back-to-back, usually to make a hitsound for the next spinner without the use of a circle or [pre-spinner note](#pre-spinner-note).

There are ranked maps that use 3 spinners in a row but are very rare.
The common usage of this technique is either before a break or near the end of a song.

### End Spinner

Nominator(s):

**End spinner** is pretty self-explanatory.
This is a spinner that is the last hit object of the beatmap.

### Short Spinners

*Not to be confused with [Ninja Spinners](/wiki/Beatmapping/Mapping_techniques/Unrankable#ninja-spinners).*
