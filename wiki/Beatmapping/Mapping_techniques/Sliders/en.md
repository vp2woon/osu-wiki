## Patterns

### Etna Sliders

Nominator: [kingcobra52](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9934)

**Etna sliders** is typically comprised of 6 to 8 sliders that are half a beat long and separated by another half a beat.
They can go in any direction and there are usually plenty of them.

The term "Etna sliders" were coined by [awp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2650) and named after a [character from Disgaea](https://disgaea.fandom.com/wiki/Etna) who appeared in one of his maps.

### Introverted Flow

Nominator: [Lizzy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1394757)

**Introverted flow** is (literally translated from Latin) "pointing towards inside".
This can be seen as:

- a sharp flow dropoff from an arc to another that sometimes [blankets](/wiki/Beatmapping/Mapping_techniques/Formations#blanket-combos) the start of the previous one.
- a not-so sharp dropoff making the first arc [blanket](/wiki/Beatmapping/Mapping_techniques/Formations#blanket-combos) the end of the second one, with or without hit circle between.

### Mirrored Sliders

Nominator: [kingcobra52](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9934)

**Mirrored sliders** uses two sliders that are identical.
However, one of these are flipped and reversed.

### Parallel Sliders

Nominator: [rust45](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/117369)

**Parallel sliders** uses a group of sliders that are all parallel to each other, the slider starts may or may not be next to the ends and they may go any direction.

### Segment Sliders

Nominator: [Xgor](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/98661)

**Segment sliders** is comprised of a number of sliders that start on the previous slider's end point.
They are usually done with [Etna sliders](#etna-sliders), but can also be used with sliders 3 to 4 or more beats long.

### Short Repeating Sliders

*Also known as: **Kick Slider***

*Not to be confused with [Hold Sliders](/wiki/Beatmapping/Mapping_techniques/Unrankable#hold-sliders).*

Nominator: [kingcobra52](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9934)

**Short repeating sliders** consist of a series of sliders that are both short and having many repeats.
All sliders usually have the same number of repeats and fall on the whole or half beat in order to make it easy to follow.

### Slider Trains

*Also known as: **Slider Fans***

Nominator: [MegaManEXE](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/951)

**Slider Trains** is a series of sliders (of same length) placed in the shape of a fan.
The player must click each slider, as if it is a stream.

For example, if it was a 1/2 slider, the player would click in a 1/1 rhythm.

The sliders can go in, or out (or both).

### Zig-Zagging Sliders

Nominator: [kingcobra52](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9934)

**Zig-Zagging sliders** are half-beat sliders arranged in a zig-zag pattern (like a "Z" or an "S").
However, these are positioned so that the each slider moves away from the next slider, creating a quick jump for the player.

## Stylish

### Cutting Sliders

Nominator: [Mashley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/41481)

**Cutting sliders** consists of 2 sliders, usually 1 beat long and 1/2 a beat apart, that overlap each other.
The second slider looks like it is *cutting through* the other slider, hence the name.

### Crumpled Sliders

Nominator: [Lilac](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/58197)

**Crumpled sliders** uses a slider with many control points to compress the slider in order to create a sort of crumpled or squashed effect.
In essence, this would make a slider seem shorter than it is supposed to be.
These can come in various forms.

### End-Cutter Sliders

Nominator: [Xgor](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/98661)

**End-Cutter sliders** uses a slider whose end is stacked on another slider's path.

### Krisom-Krosses

Nominator: [Rukario](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/110372)

**Krisom-Krosses** consists of two [Wave Sliders](#wave-sliders).
These are horizontally or vertically [mirrored sliders](#mirrored-sliders) such that the middle of both sliders overlap.

This technique is named after by [Krisom](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/99269).

### Rainbow Sliders

Nominator: MetalMario201

**Rainbow sliders** are large, arc-shaped sliders which generally take up half of the screen.
These are best used in places with long, climactic, hold notes (sort of like spinners).

[EBA](/wiki/iNiS_games) was just full of these.

### Slider Art

Nominator: [Shinxyn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13996)

**Slider art** uses one long slider to draw an image or symbol of some sort.

These are usually discouraged by the community.

### Spider Sliders

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

### Spiral Slider

Nominator: [Xgor](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/98661)

A **spiral slider** is a slider that goes in a spiral.

The spiral could start from the outside or the inside and could have a repeat arrow.

### Wave Sliders

Nominator: [RandomJibberish](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/157879)

**Wave sliders** are sliders in an "S" shape.
It curves in one direction then the opposite direction.
They are used to be a little more interesting than a regular straight slider.

### Windmill Sliders

Nominator: [Lybydose](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/64501)

A **windmill sliders** is a series of four sliders, all of which originate from a shared centre point.
This will make it look like a windmill.
The sliders may not necessarily be curved, which can instead form a cross or an "x" design.

## Miscellaneous

### Switch-Back Sliders

Nominator: [GladiOol](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23326)

**Switch-Back sliders** consists of a curved half-beat slider.
It is then copy-and-pasted, rotated 180 degrees, and placed so it curves into the previous slider (similar to [Etna sliders](#etna-sliders)).
A hit circle is then placed where the previous slider head was.

### Tick-Hitsounds

Nominator: [Rolled](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5243)

**Tick-Hitsounds** consists of slider ticks that has been replaced with a standard hitsound (clap, whistle, finish — usually overlayed with hit-normal/soft for accurate sound).
These are usually used to make a hitsound seem "constant" even during a slider.

### Tricky Triple Combo

Nominator: [FishHook](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/167586)

**Tricky triple combo** consists of 2 sliders and one note.
The note is sandwiched between the sliders to give an illusion that there is a triplet when there actually isn't.
