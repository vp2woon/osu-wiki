# Grid snapping

**Grid snapping** refers to the act of using the `Grid Snap` button functionality in the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor). Enabling it will force every [hit object](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) that is interacted with by the creator to move to the nearest position along the intersections of the grid, or, in other words, "snapping". The `Grid Snap` button can be found on the right-hand side of the editor.

The base level of spacing between each sector of the grid can be adjusted by pressing `G`, or by navigating to `View` -> `Grid Level`. **Grid snapping** can help with aligning objects to one another and attempt to arrange them in neater patterns.
