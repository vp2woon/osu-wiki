# New combo

*For other uses, see [NC (disambiguation)](/wiki/Disambiguation/NC).*

**New combos** (more commonly known as *NCs*) signal the start of a new [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo). How new combos behave during gameplay depends on the currently selected [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode). They can be selected while [beatmapping](/wiki/Beatmapping) in the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor) by clicking the `New Combo` button on the right side of the `Compose` tab, or by using the shortcut `Q`. New combos are an integral part to [colourhaxing](/wiki/Beatmapping/Colourhaxing).

## osu!

In [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!), each [hit object](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) has its own combo number and [combo colour](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo_colour). When a new combo is started, the combo colour changes and the combo number resets to one. This counts up for each following object.

*Note: [Spinners](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Spinner) force the next hit object to start a new combo.*

## osu!catch

In [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch), each type of [fruit](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Fruit) is coloured by the currently selected combo colour. When a new combo is started, the combo colour changes. Unlike in osu!, fruits do not have a combo number.

## Other game modes

[osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko) and [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!mania) do not use new combos.
