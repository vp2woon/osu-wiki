# Slider tick rate

*Slider tick rate* is the rate at which [slider ticks](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider/Slider_tick) appear in [sliders](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider). For example, slider tick rate 1 means that slider ticks appears once per beat. However, as slider ticks do not appear in [sliderheads](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider/Sliderhead) and [sliderends](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider/Slidertail), some sliders do not contain any slider ticks. For example, a 1-beat slider does not contain any slider ticks with the slider tick rate set to 1. Typical slider tick rates include 1, 2 and 4. 3 is also available but is rarely used.
