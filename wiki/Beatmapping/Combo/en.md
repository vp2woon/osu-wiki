# Combo

*For other uses, see [Combo (disambiguation)](/wiki/Disambiguation/Combo).*

**Combo** (or **comboset**) refers to a set of [hit circles](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Hit_circle) and [sliders](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider) in [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) and [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). [Hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) of the same combo share a [combo colour](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo_colour) and are connected by followpoints. The end of a combo will award bonus [health](/wiki/Gameplay/Health) if completed successfully. Each combo starts with a hit object marked with a new combo.

[osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko) and [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!mania) do not use combos.

## osu!

In [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!), each hit object in a combo has its own combo number, in addition to a combo colour. New combos start at 1 and count up, and [spinners](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Spinner) also force the next object to start a new combo. More health is recovered with [Geki](/wiki/Gameplay/Judgement/Geki) and [Katu](/wiki/Gameplay/Judgement/Katu) hit scores, which can be given from the last hit object in a combo.

## osu!catch

In [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch), each type of [fruit](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Fruit) is coloured in the order given. [Juice streams](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Juice_stream) and fruits at the end of sliders will always have the same colour as the start fruit, however [bananas](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Banana) will always have a tint of yellow. When a combo is completed, the fruits stacked on the catcher's plate will explode outwards.
