# Article styling criteria

*For news posts, see: [News Styling Criteria](/wiki/News_styling_criteria)*

The article styling criteria (ASC) serve as the osu! wiki's enforced styling standards to keep consistency in clarity, formatting, and layout in all articles, and to help them strive for proper grammar, correct spelling, and correct information.

These articles are primarily tools to aid in reviewing and represent the consensus of osu! wiki contributors formed over the years. Since the wiki is a collaborative effort through the review process, it is not necessary to read or memorise all of the ASC at once. If you are looking to contribute, read the [contribution guide](/wiki/osu!_wiki/Contribution_guide).

To suggest changes regarding the article styling criteria, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/issues/new).

## Standards

*Notice: The articles below use [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) to describe requirement levels.*

The article styling criteria are split up into two articles:

- [Formatting](Formatting): includes Markdown and other formatting rules
- [Writing](Writing): includes writing practices and other grammar rules
