## Weekly multiplayer lobbies

As of now, joining the weekly multiplayer lobbies requires participants to download and install [osu!(lazer)](/wiki/Client/Release_stream/Lazer).

1. Every 2 weeks of a season, a single playlist lobby is opened. Everyone can participate for the entire week.
   - After the first wave of lobbies, playlists will be opened again on a weekly basis.
2. Each playlist lobby provides a pre-defined playlist of beatmaps.
   - Each playlist contains an even distribution of Hard, Insane and Expert beatmaps.
   - Each playlist corresponds with the letter assigned to each 2 weeks. Therefore, each playlist gets replayed once during a season.
3. Within a playlist lobby, everyone competes towards a room-specific leaderboard.
   - Only the best score results on each beatmap within the playlist are summed up to create a weekly ranked score for each player.
   - Each beatmap of a playlist counts equally to the leaderboard score.
   - The individual beatmap score is based on osu!(lazer)'s scoring system.
4. Once a playlist lobby concludes, the weekly ranked score of each participant of the room is added to the seasonal leaderboard.
