# Star (disambiguation)

**Star** can have multiple meanings:

1. A stage in a beatmap's [forum modding](/wiki/Modding/Forum_modding) process where a moderator judges a beatmap to be on the right track but needing some improvements before approve with a [bubble](/wiki/Modding/Bubble).
   - Examples include adjustments in timing, incorrect beat spacing in some areas, or creating additional difficulty versions.
   - Beatmaps receiving a star are denoted by a star graphic next to their thread's title.
   - A star may be removed by another mod if the beatmap is thought to be in need of more improvements.
2. Another term for "Star Rating".
   - The symbol that represents the difficulty of a beatmap.
3. Another term for "[Kudosu](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu)".
   - These are given to beatmap modders and can be used to raise a beatmap above others.
4. Another term for "[Star Priority](/wiki/Modding/Star_priority)".
   - These stars are given to [osu!supporters](/wiki/osu!supporter) and are used in [Feature Requests](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/4).
