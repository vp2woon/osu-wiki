# Beatmapping and Editor

*Main page: [Help centre](/wiki/Help_centre)*

This section is dedicated to issues with the Beatmap Editor and beatmapping in general.

## How do I upload/update my map? {id=upload-beatmap}

**You can do this through the in-game editor.**

To upload your beatmap, go into the editor and hit `File` > `Upload Beatmap`.

This will make your beatmap available for others to download on the website. Updating a map is the same process for a map that has already been uploaded.

Each user has a limited number of maps they can simultaneously upload. Leaving a map inactive for a month (28 days), by not updating it, will send it to the [Beatmap Graveyard](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#graveyard). To revive a beatmap from the graveyard back into a Pending or WIP status, update it.

## The editor is telling me "The beatmap you are trying to submit isn't yours!" {id=wrong-author}

**This can happen if the creator of the beatmap is not properly set within the beatmap files.**

In the editor, click `File` in the menu, then `Open .osu in Notepad`. Check the line `Creator:` under the `Metadata` section and make sure that it's set to your exact username, capitalisation included.

If it isn't, manually change it for every difficulty in your beatmap, reload the beatmap, and you should be able to submit it.

If you are still having issues or want more information on this, have a read through the [BSS issues page](/wiki/Guides/BSS_issues).

## I am an osu!supporter, but I don't have 20 pending slots! {id=upload-slots}

**The number of slots available depends on the number of ranked maps you have. For details, see [osu!supporter ยง Increased limits](/wiki/osu!supporter#increased-limits).**

## My beatmap/content has been re-uploaded by another user without my consent, and I want the infringing copy to be taken down! {id=report-content-dmca}

**Please file a DMCA claim to [copyright@ppy.sh](mailto:copyright@ppy.sh) as per the [osu! copyright policy](/wiki/Legal/Copyright).**

Any kind of content uploaded without permission can be handled as copyright infringement if the original owner so wishes. Requesting removal requires a legal procedure in order to ensure fair proceedings.

Please do **not** file a report using either [the in-game `!report` command](/wiki/Reporting_bad_behaviour#in-game-chat) or [the osu! website](/wiki/Reporting_bad_behaviour#website), as members of the [NAT](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) and [GMT](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team) who manage these reports are not equipped to handle legal matters.

## How can I delete my beatmap? {id=delete-beatmap}

**The [support team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Account_support_team) does not take requests to manually delete uploaded beatmaps.**

You can delete your beatmap yourself by waiting for it to decay to the beatmap Graveyard, which it will do so after a month (28 days) without updates.

Once your beatmap is in the Graveyard, you can delete it yourself by going to the [Discussion page](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion) of your beatmap and clicking the `Delete` button that appears on the right side of the screen after scrolling down.
