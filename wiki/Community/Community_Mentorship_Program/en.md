# Community Mentorship Program

The **Community Mentorship Program** is a way for inexperienced mappers to engage with the mapping community through mentoring from experienced mappers or modders.

The program is organised through Discord and is managed in seasonal cycles. Each cycle is announced through a forum post and occasional cycles are advertised through front page news posts.

## Earlier mentoring programs

Between 2010 and 2013, community mentoring was set up for inexperienced mappers to learn directly from members of the [Beatmap Appreciation Team (*BAT*)](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team) and the [Mapping Assistance Team (*MAT*)](/wiki/People/Mapping_Assistance_Team).

This program was organised by [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335), [Shiro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/113005), and [Kurai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/77089), each at different points in its history.
