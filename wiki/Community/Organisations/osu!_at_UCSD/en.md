# osu! at UCSD

**osu! at UCSD** is an osu! club run as a division of *Triton Gaming* at the University of California, San Diego (*UCSD*). Its goal is to give osu! players at or around UCSD a space to connect with each other and build a local community. They host regular meetups both in person and online, as well as LAN and online osu! tournaments.

See the [osu! at UCSD tournament index page](/wiki/Tournaments/osu!_at_UCSD) for more information about their tournaments.
