# Feature Requests

**[Feature Requests](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/4)** is a forum created for suggestions regarding osu!. Users can promote feature requests and increase their priority by [spending stars](/wiki/Modding/Star_priority) obtained with [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter).<!-- TODO: part of Modding/Star_priority belongs here -->

Nowadays, the Feature Requests forum is obsolete, and has been mostly replaced by the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ppy/osu/discussions) flow.
