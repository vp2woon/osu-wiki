# osu! community meetings

The **osu! community meetings** are a discussion panel hosted by the [osu! team](/wiki/People/osu!_team). The primary aim of these meetings is to give anyone a chance to speak directly with the developers and people responsible for managing the community to raise issues for discussion or further consideration.

Long ago in the [game's distant past](https://twitter.com/ppy/status/1169256824052170755), the osu! team used to host regular community meetings where everyone was welcome to talk. With the scale of the game today, this is no longer feasible, but through Discord a queueing system of sorts has been implemented where questions can be addressed one at a time.

If you are interested in asking questions, please make sure you've read through the guidelines listed further down this page.

Currently, the osu! community meetings are being chaired by [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2), [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335), and [smoogipoo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1040328).

## Getting involved

The osu! community meetings are currently hosted on a Discord Stage on the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy), and simulcasted on [peppy's Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/ppy). Each meeting usually last about an hour.

The meetings are announced with reminders on [peppy's Twitter](https://twitter.com/ppy). To get notified about these meetings when they start, mark yourself as interested using the event posted on the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy).

Everyone is welcome to join! If you have a question or have something to add to the discussion, you can raise your hand on the Discord Stage to join the queue, or write a message on the relevant Discord thread in the `#community-meetings` channel if you are not comfortable speaking, which will be read out loud and answered. In addition, before asking a question, please observe the following guidelines:

- Plan your talking points ahead of time, and keep them as concise as possible.
- Try to only bring up issues which affect the larger community, not just you.
- Verification on osu! is not necessary, but may increase your chances of being selected for questions during Q&A sessions.

The aim is to take no more than 5 minutes per question, so please understand that previously answered or especially generic questions may be skipped.

**Please also note that not all meetings will hold Q&A sessions.**
