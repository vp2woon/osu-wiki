# osu!monthly

**osu!monthly** was a monthly newsletter hosting a variety of written content, including interviews, editorials, coverage of official and community news, and word games. The project has been discontinued and later brought back several times in different forms, but all shared the common goal of informing and entertaining the osu! community.

## Original magazine run (2011)

The original run of osu!monthly, founded by ::{ flag=US }:: [jjrocks](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/30985) and ::{ flag=GB }:: [Corin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/639270), ran from March to October 2011. It started as a Google document, but quickly evolved into a PDF format resembling a print magazine. This run was well known for its wide variety of articles as well as its distinct and creative artistic direction.
