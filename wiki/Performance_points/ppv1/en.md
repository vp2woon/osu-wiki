# ppv1

The first performance score (abbreviated as **ppv1**) is an ancient ranking system for players globally across all modes from osu!. It replaced the old system of *ranking by total score* and was abandoned due to the implementation of [ppv2](/wiki/Performance_points/ppv2).

## History

ppv1 was launched in April 2012 and initially mentioned in players' profiles under the name ``???`` during a test phase. After finally being renamed to **pp** (performance points) on April 17, 2012. This system existed with the previous ranking system (*ranking by total score*) and eventually became the unique system in-place on July 24, 2012 during the release of version [20120722-24](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/1687719 "20120722-24") of the osu! client.

This system was initially updated at regular intervals (usually every 24 hours) until finally being run in real-time on August 16, 2012.

ppv1 was abandoned and replaced by **ppv2** on January 27, 2014. The reasons behind that change were the criticism of the players:

- Missing opacity of the algorithm
- Promotion of ``Hard`` difficulties with mods
- Low worth of insane difficulties

It also allowed peppy to separate the job of maintaining and updating the filing system and thus ease its workload.

## Algorithm

The calculations involved are not publicly known, however some indications on the inner workings of the system were disclosed:

- ppv1 highlights the skill and cannot be farmed.
- The score is evaluated in relation to the difficulty of the map; based on statistics that were not available to the public.
- The number of points obtainable naturally decreases with time (thus, inactive players may lose up to half of their points within a year).
- No penalties for bad scores; only rewards for good scores.
- All *Ranked* and *Approved* maps are taken into account in the calculations.
- The player's accuracy is taken into account.
- The multipliers of mods are different from those announced in the game.
- Mode-specific difficulties are favoured.
- If a score is not placed in the top 500 of a map, it will not count.

## Climbing the rankings

The ranking is mainly related to the performance on individual maps, leading many players to only focus on mastering single difficulties. ppv1 encouraged a common theme of practices among players:<!-- the list below is totally vague -->

- Playing better and scoring better grades on the beatmaps.
- Improving the accuracy; even a small percent can make the difference.
- Getting a rank on the most popular maps, where it is harder to get a place.
- Playing difficult maps.
- Improving old scores.
- Getting SS grades.
