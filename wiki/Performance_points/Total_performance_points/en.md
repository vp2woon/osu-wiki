# Total performance points

The **total performance points** is a value that determines a player's [ranking position](/wiki/Ranking) in comparison to others. It is calculated based on their achieved scores, the [ppv2](/wiki/Performance_points/ppv2) algorithm and the [weighting system](/wiki/Performance_points/Weighting_system).

The dedicated total performance points ranking for all players can be found on the [global leaderboards](https://osu.ppy.sh/rankings/osu/performance). It can also be navigated to by hovering over the `rankings` menu on the website header and clicking the `performance` option.

A player's individual rank can also be seen from almost anywhere within the osu! game client [interface](/wiki/Client/Interface).
