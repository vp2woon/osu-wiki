# Syncopation

**Syncopation** is the regular accenting or emphasising of notes that would usually not be. The [time signature](/wiki/Music_theory/Time_signature) of a piece of music gives an indication of a regular [rhythm](/wiki/Music_theory/Rhythm) pattern of strong and weak beats, whereas a syncopated rhythm goes against this expectation by putting accents off-beat or on weak beats. In [beatmapping](/wiki/Beatmapping), syncopation in a song can usually be seen when [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) are regularly put off the beat instead of on the beat, such as on red or blue timeline ticks.

As a simple example, [fanzhen0019's Insane difficulty of *Chasers - Lost*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/151114#osu/372628) contains [slider](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider) patterns both with on-beat and off-beat [sliderheads](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider/Sliderhead).

Some of the slider patterns, such as the very first one, follow the synth melody which is syncopated against the drum kicks, landing on red timeline ticks:

This is contrary to slider patterns in the same beatmap that follow the percussion, landing on white timeline ticks:
