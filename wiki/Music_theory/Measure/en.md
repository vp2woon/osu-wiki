# Measure

![A measure in the timing tab timeline](img/measure_timing.png "White ticks represent beats, with the larger ones representing the start of a new measure.")

A **measure** (or **bar**) in music theory refers to a single unit of time featuring a specific number of [beats](/wiki/Music_theory/Beat) (determined by the [time signature](/wiki/Music_theory/Time_signature)) played at a particular [tempo](/wiki/Music_theory/Tempo).

In the [beatmap editor timeline](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Timelines), a measure can be identified as the gap between two large white ticks.
