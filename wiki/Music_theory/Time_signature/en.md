# Time signature

*For more information on time signatures in music theory, see: [Time signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signature)*

A **time signature** is a musical term defining the number of [beats](/wiki/Music_theory/Beat) in a single [measure](/wiki/Music_theory/Measure) of the song (the top number), and which note indicates a single beat (the bottom number). For a time signature of 4/4 (a.k.a. "common time"), 4 1/4 notes (*crotchets* or *quarter notes*) fit in one measure, while a time signature of 3/4 (a.k.a. "waltz" or "three-four-time") means that 3 1/4 notes fit in one measure.

The osu! [beatmap editor](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor) offers several time signatures for [mapping](/wiki/Beatmapping), which can be selected from the [Timing menu](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Timing). These include 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, and 7/4.
