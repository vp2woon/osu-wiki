# Beat

A **beat** is a repeating event or unit of time in music, which creates the rhythm that a person would tap or nod their head to while listening.

Beats usually have the same length as a quarter note (depending on the denominator of the [time signature](/wiki/Music_theory/Time_signature)), which are contained between two adjacent white lines on the [beatmap editor timeline](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Timelines). Equal amounts of beats are grouped into [measures](/wiki/Music_theory/Measure), which start from [downbeats](/wiki/Music_theory/Downbeat) represented by large white ticks. The time between each beat depends on [tempo](/wiki/Music_theory/Tempo).

Other notes are expressed through a beat by dividing or multiplying its length. The beatmap editor's [beat snap divisor](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Beat_snap_divisor) does that automatically for a mapper, allowing for changing the temporal granularity on the fly.

Since a beat snap divisor of 1/1 corresponds to a whole beat, one beat is also commonly referred to as a "1/1", a half of a beat (an eighth note) is called a "1/2", a quarter of a beat (a sixteenth note) is called a "1/4", etc.
