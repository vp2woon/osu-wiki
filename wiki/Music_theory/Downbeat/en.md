# Downbeat

The **downbeat** is the first beat of a bar in measured music. It can be seen on the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor) timeline as big white ticks. Its name is derived from the downward stroke of the director or conductor's baton on the first beat of each measure. It usually carries the strongest accent of the rhythmic cycle.
