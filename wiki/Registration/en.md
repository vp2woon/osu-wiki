# Registration

*Warning: Having more than one osu! user account at any time is an infringement against the [osu! rules](/wiki/Rules)!*

1. After [installing](/wiki/Client/Installation) osu! and running it, osu! will prompt you to sign in or register. Assuming that you're here because you need an account, click `Create an account`.

2. Fill out all of the fields in the form.

   - For the username field, there is a maximum of 15 characters; of which can only be alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`), underscores (`_`), square brackets, (`[` and `]`), dashes (`-`), and spaces (` `).
   - For the email address field, use your email. This is used to reset your password and to send you verification codes when needed, so don't use a throw away email.
   - For the password field, use a password that is at least 8 characters long.

3. Once this is completed, click `1. Create my account!`. You will be automatically signed in.

## What's next?

Don't forget to read the [rules](/wiki/Rules) very carefully!

Once that is done, you are now ready to start your rhythm adventure! You can [add beatmaps](/wiki/Client/Installation#adding-beatmaps) to play, [make a skin](/wiki/Skinning), or [make a beatmap](/wiki/Beatmapping). You could also stop by and say "Hi" in the [Introductions subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/8).

If you need further in-game help, you can ask in the `#help` [Internet Relay Chat](/wiki/Community/Internet_Relay_Chat) (IRC) channel by opening the chat console (press `F8` or `F9` in-game) then type `/join help`. You could also post your question in the [Help subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/5).
