# Skin

A **skin** is a set of images and audio clips that replace the default ones used by osu!. Many players use skins to allow for a more customised user experience. Most of the important UI elements and sounds in osu! can be overridden, or [skinned](/wiki/Skinning).

Skins can be used to further optimize gameplay, since many of them hide certain visual details or offer gameplay elements focused on a certain [playstyle](/wiki/Gameplay/Play_style), such as specific [mod](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier) combinations. In addition to that, some skins offer custom menus, which commonly feature characters from various anime and games, or are based around certain design styles, such as minimalism or techno.

## How to use custom skins

Skins can either be [created from scratch](/wiki/Skinning), or downloaded as an [`.osk` file](/wiki/Client/File_formats/osk_(file_format)) and imported into the game. To import an `.osk` file, simply open it with osu!, or drag and drop it into the game. If the downloaded skin file has the `.zip` or `.rar` format, extract. The resulting folder, which contains the `skin.ini` file, can then be moved into the `Skins` folder of your osu! installation.
