# Offset Wizard

*See also: [How to use the Offset Wizard](/wiki/Guides/How_to_use_the_Offset_Wizard) and [Universal offset](/wiki/Offset/Universal_offset)*

The **Offset Wizard** is a built-in tool that assists the user in calibrating the [universal offset](/wiki/Offset/Universal_offset) to the correct value for their device. This is necessary when the [hitsounds](/wiki/Beatmapping/Hitsound) feel out of sync with the music, across every beatmap you play. For more information on how to do this, see [How to use the Offset Wizard](/wiki/Guides/How_to_use_the_Offset_Wizard).

To access the Offset Wizard, open the [Options](/wiki/Client/Options) menu and type `offset` into the quick-search. Then click on the `Offset wizard` button.

Upon opening the Offset Wizard, the user is greeted with a metronome ticking, and vertical green bars scrolling across the screen repeatedly. The song that was last selected will begin playing, although this can be changed via the jukebox at the top right corner of the screen.

The current universal offset will be displayed at the top left corner of the screen. It can be changed by pressing the `Up arrow` and `Down arrow`, or by using the mouse scroll wheel.

Underneath the universal offset value display are three options that change the speed of the metronome. Enabling `Half tick` will double the amount of time between ticks on the metronome, making it slower. This will also display the `Tick on other beat` option. Enabling `Tick on other beat` will keep the time between metronome ticks the same as on `Half tick`, but on a different beat. Lastly, enabling `Double tick` will halve the amount of time between ticks on the metronome, making it faster. These options are used to adjust the metronome, to make it better fit the song that is playing.

The green bars scrolling across the screen are "ticks". When they pass through the vertical line in the centre of the screen, they will flash white and play a tick sound to represent the beat. Ticks add a useful visual aspect in the process of calibrating the universal offset.

To exit the Offset Wizard, simply click the `Back` button at the bottom left corner of the screen, or press `Esc`. Upon exiting, the universal offset value displayed in the Offset Wizard screen will be set as the universal offset.
