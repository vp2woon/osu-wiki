# Ignore list

The **ignore list** is a blacklist of words (or users) that a player does not want to be displayed in the [chat console](/wiki/Client/Interface/Chat_console). The ignore list can be accessed and modified in the [user settings menu](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit) under the privacy tab.
