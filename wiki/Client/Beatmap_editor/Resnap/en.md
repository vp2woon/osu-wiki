# Resnap

**Resnap** refers to a pair of commands under the `Timing` tab in the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor). One of which applies to the entire [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) and the other to the current timing section. If the beatmap has only one timing section, both commands are the same.

This command will automatically reposition all [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) on the timeline so that they fall on the closest beat division that the snap divisor allows. Usage is suggested when there has been a change in offset and/or BPM, after objects have been placed. Many creators recommend checking every hit object and adjusting its position on the [timeline](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Timelines) manually due to this tool's inaccurate and systematic nature.
