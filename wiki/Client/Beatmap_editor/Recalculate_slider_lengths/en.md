# Recalculate slider lengths

**Recalculate slider lengths** is a command under the `Timing` tab in the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor). Usage of this is suggested after a [BPM](/wiki/Music_theory/Tempo) change is made if the [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) already has [sliders](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider).

This command will automatically adjust the length of every slider in the beatmap to the new BPM. Although most creators recommended checking every slider and adjusting its length manually, due to this tool's inaccurate and systematic nature.
