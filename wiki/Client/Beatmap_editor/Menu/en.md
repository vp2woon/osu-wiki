## Notes

[^osz2-note]: This action is disabled for regular `osz` beatmaps.
[^exit-note]: This action sometimes *ignores* changes made in the `Design` tab.
[^stacking-note]: The stacking behaviour is controlled by the [stack leniency](/wiki/Beatmap/Stack_leniency) setting of the difficulty.
[^live-mapping-note]: osu!, osu!taiko, and osu!catch use the osu!taiko key bindings.
[^recalculate-lengths-note]: Useful if the BPM or [slider velocity](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider/Slider_velocity) has been changed.
[^help-note]: This action does not work anymore.
