# Cookie

*See also: [Brand identity guidelines](/wiki/Brand_identity_guidelines)*

**Cookie** is another word for the osu! logo and refers to its shape. The cookie appears many times in the game client. It can be seen in the splash screen, main menu, solo mode, and previously in old crash reports as seen below.
