# Health bar

*For health as a mechanic, see: [Health](/wiki/Gameplay/Health)*

The **health bar** (also known as the *HP bar*) is a bar which displays a player's remaining [health](/wiki/Gameplay/Health). In all [game modes](/wiki/Game_mode) except [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!mania), there is an indicator moving along the health bar that shows a player's current health.

In [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) and [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch), if the health bar drains completely, the player will fail the current [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) (assuming no special game modifiers are enabled).

In [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko), it is impossible to fail a beatmap *during* play, but it is possible to fail after the beatmap has ended if the player has not filled the health bar enough.

In osu!, osu!catch, and osu!taiko, the health bar is displayed in the top-left corner of the screen. Whereas in osu!mania, it is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, and is placed to the right of the playfield.

In osu! and osu!catch, the health bar will drain at a constant rate throughout the course of a beatmap, with the exception of breaks. This effect is known as [health drain](/wiki/Gameplay/Health).
