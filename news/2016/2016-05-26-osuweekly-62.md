**Look's like flyte is [on top of his game](https://next.ppy.sh/post/144798391978/its-friday-and-its-time-to-drop-mor-wait-its) this week as usual!** This time, we have a sneak peek at what appears to be the new beatmap information page. In the past, I've always thought to myself "damn, wouldn't it be great if the cute girls were bigger?". Looks like flyte has gone and given us just that!

<p style="text-align:center;"><i>I think flyte's design rationale follows closely with what the creators of the beatmaps had in mind...</i></p>

**It looks like the long awaited results for the comeback monthly beatmapping contest is out!** It doesn't quite make sense to talk about the entire post again in here, so be sure to check out the [full post](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-05-26-monthly-beatmapping-contest-12-results) for details. If you missed out, the MBC will be back shortly. Until then, be sure to check out the currently ongoing [aspire contest!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-05-17-aspire-returns-beatmap-contest)

**There are a couple of language/region specific tournaments happening right now!** Just to name a few that were brought to my attention, the spanish community is hosting their very own [4K osu!mania tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/5126409). This tournament seems to have a little bit of history with our very own [juankristal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/443656), and promises to be a lot of fun for participants of all ranks. On the other hand, we have the osu! Indonesia Tournament \#6 completed their first knockout round this passing weekend. Apparently, their tournament runs on a willcrushing single elimination format, so it's bound to be entertaining to watch!

**Welcome to the first week of osu!catch World Cup coverage!** -KousakaHonoka- will be helping me write this section, so expect lots of cool details coming your way right from the middle of the action!

**Despite being only the group stages, a lot of intense battles took in all groups.** Taiwan traded wins with France back and forth, but coming out on top was France with a 4 - 3 result. A similar result happened with team Netherlands and Mexico, as they traded wins with Mexico coming out on top with a 4 - 3 as well. The United States caught up from a 1 - 3 score deficit to come out on top with a 4 - 3 result over mexico, and Japan pulled off a similar feat against Chile.

Even though close calls are popping up across the board, the match that made the weekend was definitely Indonesia vs Poland. The final score really doesn't tell the story, with two matches stolen from right under Indonesia's feet.

<p style="text-align:center;"><i>I wonder how many people fell from their chairs this weekend...</i></p>

**It seems that there are a lot of returning teams coming into the Round of 16!** After failing to make it out of group stages last year, teams Japan, Sweden, Signapore, the United States, and Mexico are back in action in the brackets. Team Canada is a new face in the round of 16, but their path forward is not an easy one as they will be playing against the United States as their first opponent.

**The top seeds of the round of 16 are looking confident with their group stage performances,** with China, Germany, and Poland coming out with only one round loss in their matches. However, it looks like the defending world champion is having a hard time! Team South korea came out of group stages having actually lost a match to Hong Kong, with the Hong Kong team making a stunning comeback from a 0-3 start.

**Looking forward, it looks like there are going to be a couple of rematches from previous years carrying forward into the round of 16.** Team Indonesia will be facing off against Team China, who defeated the Indonesian team last year in the semi-finals. Team Germany will be throwing down against team South Korea, who defeated the German team previously in the finals of osu!catch World Cup 2014.
