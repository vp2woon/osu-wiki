[Damnae](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Damnae) was one of the pioneers of modern storyboarding, setting new standards for expectations when it comes to what can be done within the game. Today, we look at one of the storyboards he has created in our monthly storyboard showcase!

**Few storyboarders have the know-how and the innovative capacity to implement an idea like Damnae's [Nekomata Master+ - Kung-Fu Empire](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/173288).** When it comes to technical prowess, Damnae does not hold back on his creations and lets loose his vision in fun and interesting ways.

**Before Damnae arrived in the community, the idea of programmed storyboarding was merely an concept vaguely attempted several times before.** Him and a [certain other elite storyboarder](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11t) changed the landscape for storyboarding from simple strobe effects to elaborate visualized creations.

**Knowing that, the answer I got from Damnae when I asked him about his secret was almost hilarious!** You can read about what we talked about over some tea and biscuits in the interview [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wc4lKKvJm4mhMhXIMJDm6SefEc_QCIQRY0vvsqh2E8I/pub).

With that, we have come to the end of another storyboard showcase! Do you have any cool creations you stumbled upon during your adventures around osu?
