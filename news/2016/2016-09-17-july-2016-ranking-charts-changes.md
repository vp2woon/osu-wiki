It's been a year since we introduced the new evaluation system for the charts by letting four dedicated community members select the most noteworthy maps of a month which has proven to have its pros and cons. But at the end we decided to change the way of selection once again to a more staff driven system, lead by the Quality Assurance Team alongside chosen community members who are interested in volunteering for these kind of tasks.

Followed by the change of people who are from now on attached to the charts, we are also having plans in how the future charts might look like which you can read on about in the [official development blog](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/149588555393/2016-08-dev-meeting).

With thanking everyone who have put efforts in chosing the past charts, we are now heading to the Ranking Charts for July 2016 which have been just released and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=1607)!

## Ranking Charts Creation

The charts have previously been created by letting the Quality Assurance Team select the most noteworthy maps of this month. We also reward the top beatmap in each category by providing **1 month of supporter status** to the mapper.

### osu!

- **[MrSpazzaneve17 - osu! MEGAMIX](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/399575) by [Exile-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2559349)** (Nominator: [Irreversible](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1287964))

This map definitely deserved to be the winner of this months charts. Exile- managed to take already ranked maps and let them shine in a completely new way. He's done an incredible job with the storyboard too - and props to ReFaller, for making a difficulty that also approaches a lower tier of players!

- [toby fox - MEGALOVANIA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/387700) by [Kyshiro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/640611) (Nominator: [Desperate-kun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2202645))

This map is just amazing. High BPM mapped playable once in a while, with really good flow and patterns. Might be as well my personal favourite for this month.

- [Eagle - Icarus (Extended)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/400069) by [Faust](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/400069) (Nominator: [Okorin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405))

This song is generally really difficult to capture into a beatmap, mainly due to the amount of things going on in the song. Especially the huge amount of 3/4 Rhythms make this song a challenge to map and Faust did really well with capturing the core elements of this song into a rhythmically fitting and really interesting to play beatmap which utilises a lot of 1/4 jumps and is built around them which makes them really intuitive and fun to play.

- [DJ Noriken - Elektrick U-Phoria(Extended Mix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/392682) by [sionKotori](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/392682) (Nominator: [Okorin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405))

This map manages to capture the song's pacing really well. Every section of it sticks to a few unique ideas which it executes in a clean and polished manner. The overall usage of gimmicks is appropriate for what the song provides and makes for an overall unique experience.

- [REDALiCE feat. anporin - Beautiful Dream](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/463361) by [Dailycare](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1634445) (Nominator: [Irreversible](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1287964))

This entire set contains really straight forward and clean mapping across all difficulties with a well designed spread to contain a difficulty for everyone to enjoy. Since the song contains a lot of 1/4 notes that could be mapped the song contains two difficulties around the Hard level where one uses more streams to slowly introduce the mechanic. Each part of the map has a clear concept that fits the song's pace, even for the gimmicks that were used in it which make it overall an enjoyable mapset to play through and makes for a place in the charts.

- [xi - Akasha](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/403427) by [Atsuro](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/403427) (Nominator: [Okorin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405))

The higher part of this set, especially the Aether difficulty utilise interesting stream mapping techniques. It sticks to mapping the 1/6 piano with repeating sliders when it is in focus so the streams end up not being too demanding on stamina while still being interesting to play. For the part of the song which doesn't need streams it makes use of symmetry-based patterning which makes for an overall fun experience to play this diff. N/A's Another is a different take on the song and simplifies some of the 1/6 to 1/4 (and maps the constant hihat layer for that matter) for playability reasons while it manages to stay relevant overall. The Insane and lower half of the set is similar to the Aether difficulty in terms of symmetric patterning, and most of them end up on the more dense side of their respective difficulty levels, which may make progression through this set a bit more challenging even though the execution of these difficulties is fitting for something that ends up in charts.

### osu!taiko

- **[t+pazolite - Candy Crack Curtain Call](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/237272) by [tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767)** (Nominator: [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128))

t+pazolite is known for having very energetic songs which carry a lot of samples that each mapper can follow and interpret for themselves. tasuke912 has taken full advantage of this by following most of these samples and combining them to his very own patterns which make the beatmaps energetic and interesting by itself. This starts from Inner Oni having very nice build-ups in density, to Muzukashii in which placements are very consistent with patterns that vary a lot and hence make the beatmap very lively, down to Kantan with its alternative patterns which manage to give the beatmap its needed impact on such a song. Additionally, given the fact that the spread is also well done, despite it being not an easy task on high BPM songs, I consider this as one of my favorites of the past month and hence believe it deserving of the first place in this chart.

- [xi - .357 Magnum](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/155749) by [Sayaka-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/398275) (Nominator: [MMzz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/128993))

There is actually not much to say beside this beatmap being very solidly made. The patterns in the difficulties follow the piano very nicely and show a well made structure. Beside that, it is nice to have a different genre in the ranked section of osu!taiko for added variety.

- [Whispered - Kappa](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/436703) by [Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2239480) (Nominator: [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128))

Speaking the truth, this isn't a genre I feel really attached to, yet I see it as a must to add this beatmap into the current charts as it is one of a very few maps which is made using more than only patterns. Here, Raiden used excellent custom hitsounds which give the beatmap a different touch compared to the other maps we have. This proves that there is much more potential in the osu!taiko game mode than one might think and that we just have to give new ways of mapping a chance.

- [Mitsuki Kotono - Fuyu ni Saku Hana](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/401086) by [Nardoxyribonucleic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/876419) (Nominator: [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128))

Despite the difficulty spread being higher than usual, the set contains a very good mix of beat- and vocal-mapping, providing a good structure through all difficulties which makes this set one of my favorites for this month.

- [Froggie x Misato - Jekyll & Hyde](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/463342) by [hikikochan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6512678) (Nominator: [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128))

I'm surprised how well made this beatmap is considering the mapper isn't known to me. The beatmap provides very consistent and coherent patterns which alternate between each other in a way I would normally expect from someone with many years more experience. Unusual patterns such as ooxxx or oooxxx are nicely used and the alternation between finisher notes after every 4/1 beat is implemented very well to give the beatmap its own touch.

- [Aimer with chelly (EGOIST) - ninelie (TV size)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/444285) by [qoot8123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/766371) (Nominator: [DakeDekaane](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1425253))

This beatmap may look simple, but it's notable for its solid structure. It reflects accurately the changes in the song pace (getting more dense as the song reaches its climax), making it a good experience while playing. Also, we rarely have new calm and clean maps to play, so this is worth pointing out.

### osu!catch

- **[wa. vs celas - Vajuranda](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/221687) by [alienflybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114)** (Nominator: [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508))

Boasting a wide range of well-mapped difficulties, this was the stand-out map of the month for me as it truly provides something for everyone. I love how rapid direction changes are coupled with the use of triplets in the Rain and later long, twisting streams in the Overdose to provide a great playing experience requiring smooth movements. The higher-than-usual HP drain demands consistency, and given the high BPM and note density, be prepared to stay focused until the very end!

- [ParagonX9 - Chaoz Japan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/460789) by [Razor Sharp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3414261) (Nominator: [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508))

Offering a wide variety of rhythm changes to keep the player interested, this mapset is presented in a slightly unusual style, with note density, approach rate and difficulty all slightly above average for the norm. These are offset by an excellent flow whilst playing, resulting in a challenging but rewarding experience regardless of difficulty. Every part of the song is emphasised exceptionally well, aided by the emphatic drum hitsounds. For those looking to try something a little more challenging at their preferred level of difficulty, this one is well worth a shot.

- [Mami Kawada - Wings of Courage -Sora o Koete-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/245160) by [examination](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1806962) (Nominator: [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508))

This map deserves a place in the charts this month simply by virtue of one of the most amazing Storyboards I have ever seen - this could easily be mistaken for a full-motion video sequence, and all aspects compliment the song incredibly well. Whilst the difficulties themselves are not especially difficult or innovative, the focus on simplicity makes it a good choice for newer players who just want to enjoy a good song with a clean, easy-to-follow mapping style. Sometimes, less is more!

- [nano - Omoide Kakera](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/454627) by [Natsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1953876) (Nominator: [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508))

One of the most enjoyable convert maps I have played in a long time. The Hard diff provides a great opportunity to practise reading both basic jumps and interesting slider shapes, as well as stamina due to the length and high BPM. The Insane diff builds upon this brilliantly, with rapidly alternating flow through both jumps and streams that leave the player wanting more even after 4 minutes.

- [Hanatan - Kokoronashi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/449760) by [Lavender](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3850859) (Nominator: [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508))

Both the longest and calmest map in the selection this month, I find this map to be a great way to wind down after a long day. The mapper did a great job of balancing the powerful held vocals with the backing drum rhythm, and there are many clever combinations of long, curving sliders, and snappier drum singlets and triplets. Despite the calm nature of the song, the playing experience is kept interesting by a good variety in flow and some interesting jump patterns.

- [REDALiCE feat. anporin - Beautiful Dream](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/463361) by [Dailycare](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1634445) (Nominator: [Kurokami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/260933))

I choose this because it provides a full difficulty spread which satisfies players of all levels. The Expert level has a very good choice of approach rate which is good for those who can not handle the really high ones. If someone feels the patterns in Expert too much, the Another difficulty provides a good easier difficulty. While none of the Hards could be compared with the similar level of difficulty in osu!catch, they still play very well - Hyper even has some jumps where really good timing is required.

### osu!mania

- **[gmtn. (witch's slave) - furioso melodia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/307371) by [Harbyter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1147679)** (Nominator: [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092))

The mapper did a great job of charting a song like this one. The way the song's snapping is used provides pattern combinations that you'd not often see in the ranked section, and they play well in accordance to the music. When the song does go to its notable sections, the map goes along with it, keeping up with its fierceness as well as giving prominence to the strongest parts. Very good job on mapping this song overall!

- [Team Grimoire - Grimoire of Crimson](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/317861) by [[Shana Lesus]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2881789) (Nominator: [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717))

Interesting usage of patterns here. The mapper made good use of dense patterns when the song calls for it. 1/8 bursts scattered throughout the map puts further emphasis on the sound distortions (or wubs), further capturing the song's unpredictable nature and keeping you on your toes just in case those come into play. In short, it's a really good chart mapped to an interesting song!

- [xi - Ascension to Heaven](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/421541) by [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737) (Nominator: [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092))

What I like about this map is that it's simple and coherent in structure as if the mapper already has the chart laid out for you right there. Starting off relatively easy, getting a bit more difficult after the first break section, then finally reaching really high density along with fast 200BPM chordstreams in the last third compliment the song's increasing intensity. Padded with a high HP drain and OD judgment, this map is a big challenge for any high level 7K player out there.

- [Camellia - Ultimate Ascension](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/476565) by [Fresh Chicken](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3984370) (Nominator: [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717))

Going from the easiest to the hardest difficulty, this mapset brings out lots of fun patterns to play. SV changes further drive home the song's irregularity, highlighting parts where it changes pace erratically. Getting used to these patterns will take a little time because to the music's somewhat unsteady nature, but that doesn't change the fact that they go well with the song itself.

- [sakuzyo - Laplace](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/445079) by [ZZHBOY](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1565739) (Nominator: [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092))

Nice snapping usage and layering in this set. This song may seem calm due to its quiet features and relatively low BPM, but the mapset exceptionally used those features to map out dense patterns on the song's favor. At times, those patterns might become a bit too tricky to read due to the mixture of jumps and rolls appearing here and there, but they still completely grasp the song's calm nature as if they flow well together.

- [xi - Quietus Ray](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/374277) by [Kuo Kyoka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596306) (Nominator: [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717))

When listening to a song like this, words like 'extreme, intense and powerful' often come to mind. That said, this map is just like what's described. The patterns in higher difficulties go more extreme with this aspect using unusually-patterned bursts that are very tricky to go through. Nevertheless, this mapset has a full spread of difficulties that lets a vast majority of players to experience the song's intensity along with the chart.
