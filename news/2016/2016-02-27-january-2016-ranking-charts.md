The Ranking Charts for January 2016 have just been released and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1601)!

This month [ByBy13](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3436326), [mintong89](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/966210), [ZiRoX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/200768) and [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717) picked the maps for the Monthly Ranking Charts.

## Ranking Charts Creation

The charts have previously been created by letting four dedicated community members select the most noteworthy maps of this month. We also reward the top beatmap in each category by providing **1 month of supporter status** to the mapper.

### osu!

For osu!, we decided to let **[ByBy13](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3436326)** pick their favourite maps.

- **[Asterisk - Rain](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/395149) by [Monstrata](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2706438)**

A great mapset! I really enjoyed the patterns which give a nice flow. The instruments are calling for streams through the difficulty and Monstrata followed really well the different instruments. Moreover, the volume which is slowly increasing at the beginning has been very well emphasized by a slider. In addition, there is also a wonderful storyboard, which really fits the 'rainy' theme of the song. This is probably my favourite map of this month and it deserves to get the first place in January!

- [Hanatan - Uta ni Katachi wa Nai keredo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/400208) by [Asahina Momoko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3650145)

I really enjoyed playing this beatmap because of the aesthetic patterns it is using. Moreover, hitsounds are well done: I felt I was playing the piano myself because the rhythm is followed perfectly. It is emphasized and the result is really good and enjoyable to play. Actually I don't have much to say here. Everything looks very nice!

- [Marina and The Diamonds - Sex Yeah](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/379578) by [Bakari](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/597957)

Another great mapset by Bakari. I really like how he mapped the song because, he used an interesting mix in following vocals and instruments. Additionally, in the hardest difficulty, the start looks to be boring at first, but when the kiais kick in, the part becomes more interesting with the spacing increasing, resulting in jumps which are made in a very well way. Personally, I also like the storyboard with the flashy diamonds which show up during the kiai. Overall, I almost love everything in this beatmap and that's why Bakari deserves to be in this list.

- [lily white - Futari Happiness](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/399140) by [Baraatje123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2533040)

Even if it's not a very difficulty marathon map, I still like how the rhythm in this beatmap has been structured. I love how Baraatje made a combination of 1/3 and 1/6 patterns; following the trumpets of the song in a very well way. In addition, this mapset is enjoyable to play especially with DT when trying to aim the stacked hit-circles. Coming to the storyboard, I must say, it looks nice to me how the shadows of the characters are appearing accordingly to who is singing. Overall, a very nice beatmap.

- [Reol - Echo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/374055) by [Crystal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1646397)

A calm and slow song, yet, a great mapset in my point of view. One might feel like the non-kiai parts are too calm mapped, but that changes once the kiai starts! I really love the patterns in those, especially in the hardest difficulty, where the extension of the vocals were followed great. The aesthetics are kinda cool too and the flows are well made. An calm but awesome mapset, which deserves to be in the top 6 of the Ranking Charts.

- [Cororo - Fairy ring](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/316761) by [Kite](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/134572)

Another Touhou Project song from Kite! Honestly said, the hardest difficulty, Serenity, really impressed me. The reason for this is the structure of patterns and the aesthetics the map provides. Moreover, in a more specific way, I really love how the stacks were placed. Additionally I would like to mention, that in my opinion the guest difficulties are regarding their patterns and structure, great too. There is nothing else I have to say here. A great mapset which really deserves to be in this list!

### Taiko

For Taiko, we asked **[mintong89](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/966210)** about their favourite maps in January 2016.

- **[MikitoP - Akaito](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/361462) by [EdamaMe411](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4270973)**

This is the latest ranked Taiko map in January but the first beatmap I want to choose from this month, which is created by EdamaMe411. The map might sound flat and be rather easy to you, but for me, it is amazing because, even though the song is relaxing, the quality of the beatmap didn't suffer for it. That's why I think this deserves to be number one in the charts!

- [toby fox - Battle Against a True Hero](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/371182) by [S a n d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/676578)

This is the most solid mapset that I've played in this month. Its highest difficulty contains very dense streams which do not interfer with the flow of the beatmap. That's why I think it is a great map for those who want to practice playing streams. Additionally, another reason for choosing this beatmap is its song's appearance in a very popular game.

- [Camellia - Routing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/375111) by [MMzz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/128993)

Ah, another great song mapped by the known Taiko mapper MMzz! The tune of the song is so catchy that you won't get tiered of it even after playing it a lot of times. The map itself is awesome too, especially the highest difficulty which contains 1/6 patterns mixed with 1/4 and which do not feel in any way out of place.

- [yanaginagi - Haru Modoki](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/331376) by [Labyr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3995068)

This is the easiest map I picked for this month's Chart. I choose this set for seeing potential within the mapper, which can be seen in this beatmap: Following the drum hitsounds of the song in an very accurate way. It might also suffice for the mod Double Time.

- [goreshit - burn this moment into the retina of my eye](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/359890) by [Loctav](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/71366) & [aEoNNzR](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1594036)

Might sound crazy that I choose this beatmap for the Ranking Charts, but I had to choose it for the amazingly well done flow! Even though they used easier pattern structures, they managed to make them fit into the song and achieved having very difficulty beatmaps. Thumbs up to the mappers.

- [DragonForce - Defenders](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/375447) by [Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2239480)

Last but not least, I choose this map for the Charts. It suits to those who want pure and straight flow. The map is well mapped and the song is great, which makes the map worth to try!

### Catch the Beat

For Catch the Beat, **[ZiRoX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/200768)** was the chosen one to declare the winners of the January 2016 beatmaps.

- **[Taneda Risa - Wareta Ringo (TV edit)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/186692) by [mingmichael](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1570876)**

This mapset should have been in the charts a few months ago, but it just happened to be requalified on January after mingmichael came back from a hiatus, so here it is! There are a lot of things I love about this mapset: the song is great, it has a nice spread ranging from Cup to Rain, and mingmichael really managed to blend the guitar, percussions and vocals into nice patterns. It also shows a different mapping style from current mapsets, focusing on trickier dashes and not relying on tons of hyperdashes that much, which is interesting enough to grant it some place in the charts.

- [senya - Utakata, Ai no Mahoroba](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/317372) by [Razor Sharp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3414261)

Here we have it, Razor Sharp's first ranked mapset. This is one of the two CtB mapsets offering a full spread, going from a Cup mapped by Tokufi to an Overdose (Grief difficulty) mapped by Razor himself, offering every player a difficulty they can be comfortable with. Besides that, the Salad, Platter and Rain difficulties are mapped by guests, so this mapset also showcases different mapping styles. Give each difficulty a try!

- [u's - Korekara no Someday](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/335711) by [koreapenguin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1458069)

This song again? Yeah, but in a shorter version (and from different mappers)! For those in the competitive scene, there are two names you know really well: Spectator and CLSW. While last month's charts had Spectator's Korekara no Someday, this chart includes an Overdose diff by CLSW, which I couldn't ignore considering charts are a competition. Crystal's Captivation is the only CtB specific difficulty in this mapset, but there are several standard diffs ranging from Easy to Extra, so there's probably one convert for you to play here.

- [Nanamori-chu * Goraku-bu - Happy Time wa Owaranai](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/320717) by [Setz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3165798)

Going through the standard beatmaps listing was a hard thing, after I set some conditions for maps to be on my candidates list to make it to the charts. This song is long enough to guarantee a decent max score for competition, and the 5-diffs spread ranging from Easy to Extra allows players of different levels to enjoy the mapset. On top of that, the song is really catchy, and that's what made me put it in the charts over other candidates.

- [Demetori - Kuuchuu ni Shizumu Kishinjou ~ Counter-Clock World](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/347719) by [jonathanlfj](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/270377)

Here we have an interesting convert marathon mapset, consisting of 2 diffs! Both diffs contain different gameplay elements like streams, left-right jumps and stream jumps making them rather entertaining diffs to play. They also provide challenge and the scoreboards are proof of that: there's only one FC overall. Bring the best of your skills and aim for those top scores!

- [MY FIRST STORY - Itsuwari NEUROSE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/365963) by [Saut](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3799202)

When I first heard this, it reminded me a lot of ONE OK ROCK, and it turned out both vocalists are brothers. Trivia stuff aside, the 7 difficulties from this mapset provide a difficulty for every CtB player out there: Easy, Normal and Hard difficulties will appeal Cup and Salad players, while the Insane and Broccoly's Extra will feel adequate for Platter and Rain players, respectively. Jommy's Extreme and the Madness diff exploit the song's rhythm to the last, making for interesting and challenging patterns, recommended for top players.

### osu!mania

For osu!mania, **[Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717)** was able to select their personal most noteworthy beatmap from last month.

- **[xi - Happy End of the World](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/171880) by [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092)**

Blocko, I bow to you. Your mapset deserves the first place more than any other mapset ranked in January. This mapset was pending for more than one year. Blocko made it to add every keycount into a song that is longer than 6 minutes. And that is not enough. He also made a full spread for every keycount. It is a masterpiece and I am not exaggerating at all when I say that this is one of the best mapsets that got ranked in osu!mania, ever. Every keycount is perfectly adjusted for every osu!mania player. If you aren't familiar with osu!mania, you have an Easy difficulty that teaches you the basics. Should you be an advanced player, you have some nice challenging Normal to Insane difficulties. And even when you are already a good player, you still have some really challenging difficulties in every keycount! You still don't have enough and you want destroy your keyboard? Then check out the additional difficulties in the creators words! About the song, I have to say it is really well chosen. It starts out quite peaceful but it becomes dramatic the longer you listen to it. One could easily think the track reached its climax halfway through the track, but it didn't. In fact, it's starting to build up drama again just as previously, but this time the drama lasts longer, leading to a rather long outro afterwards.
You could describe it as an emotional roller coaster!
I really hope to see more mapsets like this in the future.

- [TeamGrimoire+amaneko - croiX](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/326079) by [Takane6](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568037)

croiX, one of my favorite songs from Sound Voltex and it finally has a 4K mapset. Takane6 made a really nice 4K spread of this song. While the Basic difficulty teaches you the most basic patterns on how to play osu!mania, the Gravity is even a X-Icon difficulty, which is really rarely seen in 4K! I also would like to say about the Gravity chart that the patterns are all really well chosen and the flow is very nice. It has a lot of 1/8 patterns where you need to be really fast to hit them. Additionally, it has a lot of chordmash combined with sudden change to an chordtrill in. Overall, really challenging patterns and if you haven't played this map yet, I highly recommend you to do it. You are really missing out something!

- [t+pazolite - Electric "Sister" Bitch](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/310607) by [Verniy_Chan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4428053)

t+pazolite is an artist that I think every osu player should know. This song is a collaboration between the BMS songs "Electric Butterfly" and "Little 'Sister' Bitch" and Verniy_Chan made a really well mapped beatmap of this song. This mapset has again everything from an Basic up to an Infinite chart so it's made for every player. The charts of the Advanced difficulty are getting stream heavy and additional to this it has some really well placed long notes in the middle part, ending again in long streams. Furthermore, it has some pretty challenging patterns but it is still a real lot of fun to play! Also a huge shoutout to arviejhay who made the storyboard of this map. I think this should be explicitly mentioned because it's really good! Play it at least once with Storyboard (in case you're sensitive to heavy flashing lights please use the background-dimmer!).

- [sakuzyo - Imprinting](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/378705) by [victorica_db](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2046044)

What would be the charts without more anti-meta mapsets? victorica_db chose a nice violin song from sakuzyo for a 4 and 7+1K (8K) mapset. While the 4K charts is a good mix of streams and really complex LN usage - I am pretty sure it will break a lot of combos here - the 8K chart comes with a lot of heavy jack patterns that still fit really good to the song. Also, the lowest 8K chart is a well made map to learn how to play 7+1K! It teaches you some basic 7K patterns additional to the extra scratch. Shouldn't you be able to play 8K, try it out on this Map!

- [Ti7 - Love Maker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/382365) by [DJPop](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2363)

"DJPop is back?!" I am sure that was the first thing what came into your mind when you saw this chart (at least I was thinking that.) Like every Christmas, DJPop brings us a nice Christmas song this year and like we all know DJPop, it is of course fully keysounded! And not enough. It has a full spread from 4K to 8K and additional to 8K it has even ranked 7+1K with a special scratch usage! All difficulties have really well mapped patterns that flow really nice and still can be challenging. Overall a mapset that really deserves it to be placed in the monthly charts!

- [nao - Soutaisei VISION](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/361016) by [Critical_Star](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3793196)

I had the feeling I had to choose at least one opening map for the charts! And here we are. With nao as the artist I also chose one of my favorite artists and not enough, also from my favorite game! The map is a 4K mapset with difficulties from Novice to an Insane difficulty. The patterns are well chosen here. While the Novice and Medium have more basic patterns like chords, short bursts and well placed long notes, the Advance and Extreme have a lot of chord mash and chordtrills rounded with well placed long notes to the guitar! Overall it's an really well mapped chart and Critical_Star did a really good job here.

**The January 2016 ranking charts will end on the 15th March 2016**. For the next month, we will elect new community members to pick their favourite beatmaps, so stay tuned!
