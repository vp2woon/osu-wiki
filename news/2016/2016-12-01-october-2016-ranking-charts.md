The Ranking Charts for October 2016 have been just released and can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1610)!

Additionally, with the help of [Stefan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/626907), we reintroduce to you the Chart Packs which are an easier and more convenient way to access to the charted beatmaps. You can find these and any upcoming Charts in the [Beatmap Pack Listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/packlist?t=r).

## Ranking Charts Creation

The charts have previously been created by letting volunteers alongside the Quality Assurance Team select the most noteworthy maps of this month. We also reward the top beatmap in each category by providing **1 month of supporter status** to the mapper.

### osu!

- **[Masayoshi Minoshima feat. Sakaue Nachi - ILIAS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/373543) by [-kevincela-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/266596)**  (Nominator: [Irreverible](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1287964))

Originally uploaded by Kiiwa, her spirit lives on in this mapset! Many interesting mapping styles can be found here. Starting with Elvis' very technical attempt with very unique patterns it goes on with Priti's difficulty, which offers a very good-flowing map. If you are looking for something solid with clean rhythm and polished structure, give kevincela's diff a try! Damnae also managed to pull off his Elvis' and tieff-inspired style perfectly - if you have trouble playing the higher diffs, definitely give this one a try. He's also done an outstanding job by creating a storyboard which doesn't overwhelm the player but improves his experience by playing the map. And last but not least, let's not forget Kiiwa with her unique mapping style - players who are not able to play any of the maps above will definitely find a lot of unique patterns in this one!

- [sakuzyo - Senkyou Ranbu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/460516) by [ktgster](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/53378) (Nominator: [Okorin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405))

Ktgster was able to shine once again through the mass with one of his carefully structured CS5 maps. Combined with tricky rhythm, which the song offers, the outcome is a beautifully technical map. If you want to challenge your concentration to its fullest, then definitely give this map a chance. Let's not forget about the lower difficulties though. Every single map managed to capture the intensity of the song, while keeping the restrictions in mind.

- [GRANRODEO - Can Do](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/493273) by [Monstrata](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2706438) (Nominator: [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087))

An outstanding set this month by none other than Monstrata himself. He showcases his expert mapping prowess with 7 different Extras, each possessing a theme befitting their respective character's personality. What makes it so great is that despite having 7 Extras, he managed to make them all distinct in their own ways, and the themes were executed brilliantly. The innovation displayed is truly deserving of a placing in this month's charts.

Also, for more indepth information into the ideas behind each difficulty, I suggest reading the beatmap description, it's an interesting writeup.

- [Dollscythe - Flashes (Extended)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/358350) by [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087) (Nominator: [Okorin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405))

The Spark difficulty on this mapset manages to capture this energetic song in a very clean, very creative and very fitting manner. Overall it's a really outstanding difficulty which is complimented with a very solid difficulty spread containing a difficulty for everyone to enjoy which still capture the essence of this song and which make it a fitting pick for this month's charts.

- [STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION - Renegade](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/351719) by [Irreversible](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1287964) (Nominator: [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418))

Everything about this mapset is well-designed to reflect the music. Renegade is a song loaded with complex variations that could be easily overlooked, yet Irreversible managed to express all of its subtleties masterfully in the highest difficulty. While being more restrictive, the lower difficulties also manage to capture a similar effect, earning the mapset a spot on this month's chart.

- [Nakashinoda Mugi - Senjou no Aria](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/395046) by [Okorin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405) (Nominator: [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087))

In classic Okorin fashion, a spectacular 11-difficulty full-length set all done by himself. With each difficulty being done in his own characteristic style, it feels very cohesive. The rhythm choices used are perfect in bringing out the different intensities in the song, and the movement used is that of a calming nature, very appropriate for the song choice as well. The multitude of difficulties given is also great at appealing to a wider range of audiences. All in all, a well-rounded mapset that suits its position in this month's charts.

### osu!taiko

- **[Ryu* feat.Mayumi Morinaga - Din Don Dan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/467975) by [aabc271](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/155707)** (Nominator: [S a n d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/676578))

A brain washing song with a well structured map. It offers a very well blend of beats between vocal and drums. As well, it offer patterns with variations, which is beneficial for beginners to learn alternating under a low BPM, and able to enjoy the satisfaction of hitting those finishers in kiai sections. Not to mention the detailed subtle change in volume that is included right before the song enters the first kiai, shows how much thought was put into the making of this map. For those of you who are interested into well structured maps, aabc271 is definitely your choice, as he has the ability to make you feel the love pun intended.

- [9mm Parabellum Bullet - Inferno](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/481954) by [Nofool](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/672430) (Nominator: [Ntiger](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766))

While October has brought us relatively few mapsets, quite a few of them are really well mapped, and this full spread by NoFool is not an exception! The lower diffs feature challenging yet fitting rhythms, while starting in Muzukashii, streams slowly start to appear. This builds nicely into the higher dificulties, where streams are a core aspect. Additionally, there is a high amount of well-used big notes, slider velocity changes and volume changes to give the map an interesting feel! Even drum rolls are common, which is a rare sight! Overall this set is a pleasant experience, with NoFool showing off a few rarely used techniques on top of solid taiko mapping!

- [Nakashinoda Mugi - Senjou no Aria](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/395046) by [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128) (Nominator: [Hanjamon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1703330))

And here we go with a low bpm map. OnosakiHito did a really good job here, the structure of the map itself is very clean and very consistent and the spread is also very good. You will notice that the difficulty increases as the song progresses, which makes the map more interesting along with the good variety of patterns. It's also a fun map with DT, so give it a try, but good luck maintaining good accuracy!

- [Demetori - Youkai no Yama ~ Mysterious Mountain](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/401354) by [S a n d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/676578) (Nominator: [DakeDekaane](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1425253))

Demetori has became a recent mapping trend, and this map offers an unique experience with Inner Oni being heavily based on improvised but structured mapping, a large variety of cool streams combining 1/4 and 1/3 notes in a natural way (oh boy the 1/3 streams are just tasty), while keeping the challenge aspect of the map. Additionally, we have an Oni mapped in a more traditional way and you should try it, as it's packed with the same emotion Inner Oni is.

- [Camellia - flying in the flow of deep-sea](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/397682) by [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766) and [SKSalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3280542) (Nominator: [S a n d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/676578))

A collab between Nwolf and SKSalt! On top of a high overall difficulty of 6.5, this map offers irregular patterns that involves 1/3, 1/4 and 1/6 which makes this map a great accuracy challenge.
Despite this song having complex melodies, Nwolf and SKSalt completely nailed the mapping of it. It is simply amazing to see how one could map such song into something this challenging, while interesting to play. I swear, every single time when I play the build up right before the second kiai, I get pumped and excited as hell seeing the speed increasing as well as the patterns getting more complex after each speed up. As soon as the kiai starts, I get high as hell. Who needs drug when you have this map?

- [Nanahoshi Kangengakudan - IMAGINARY LIKE THE JUSTICE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/312658) by [Nardoxyribonucleic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/876419) (Nominator: [qoot8123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/766371))

Another solid full taiko mapset which I'd like to mention in October. From eaier difficulties to harder one, mappers did very well on their maps. kantan and futsuu contains reasonable breaks by following vocal and drum,futsuu is harder than averange in order to make better difficulty gap with Muzukashii. Moreover, this set has two closed level Onis but the styles are totally different. Nardo's Oni was arranged rather rigorous or neat. ll-oscar and WoahE's one is relatively varied, plus, the SV change also provide the map become more interesting to play! To sum up ,every element about making taiko full set like spread, map's structure, pattern arrangement ... ect is quite decent. This set is worth to be one of charts as a good model of taiko full set in October!

### osu!catch

- **[FELT - Day after](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/458825) by [BennyBananas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4023183)** (Nominator: [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508))

Getting a first ranked map is a huge milestone for every mapper, but for it also to be a map of such high quality is truly impressive. The structure and pacing fit the song perfectly, from interesting and flowing slidershapes following the vocals, to snappier jump patterns showcasing the more complex drum rhythms. Each section is given the right amount of emphasis, and the extremely clean flow ties them all together beautifully. This is the product of many months of hard work and perseverance, and I'm looking forward to seeing more high quality work from Benny in the future.

- [LeaF - Evanescent](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/440997) by [Anxient](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4561368) (Nominator: [Chara](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284))

Whether you're looking for interesting converts or challenging osu!catch maps, then this map surely fits the taste of the masses. Three top-notch osu!catch difficulties from JBHyperion and Ascendance all showcase a combination of flair and difficulty. In the Rain difficulty, lots of interesting and well-made stream patterns show up which are both fun and alluring to observe. Even as the easiest of the three osu!catch specifics, it still can captivate lots of players. The next difficulty, the Overdose, is not the usual Overdose difficulty - it is only rated at around 5.17* by the star rating. However, the difficulty goes beyond numbers and uses patterns you don't see in the usual Overdose. That, combined with its well-designed flow, make for a wonderful difficulty. Finally there's the Deluge, which is quite possibly osu!catch mapping at its finest. It's structure and flow are both unorthodox and wonderful - the difficulty contains patterns which, like in the Overdose, you don't usually see in an osu!catch map. All of these diffs match the song's fast-paced and calmly chaotic nature, and that makes it one of the best osu!catch mapsets so far. The mapset also contains several gimmicky converts that feature lots of difficult maneuvers and patterns. These all mesh together to form a map that is truly one's most sought-after aspirations

- [Ben Prunty - Earth in a Jar](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/495269) by [- Magic Bomb -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3071175) (Nominator: [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508))

Magic Bomb is well known for consistently producing good quality maps aimed at newer players, but this one in particular stands out for me. The set manages to pack a decent amount of diversity despite the short length of the song, with great contrast between the calm and energetic sections. Additionally, the difficulties all play very cleanly despite the trademark antiflow style, resulting in an interesting yet fun little challenge for players looking to tackle the next tier of difficulty.

- [cYsmix - Classic Pursuit](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/488238) by [-kevincela-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/266596) (Nominator: [Kurokami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/260933))

This set is not comperable with osu!catch specific ones but I did not choose it to do that. While the difficulties are rather easy up to Hard there are still easily recognizable differencies between each part of the song. The calm parts requires less movement than the ones with intense rhythm. This difference comes becomes more noticable on higher level (Insane, Expert) where you basically needs to keep pressing the Dash button repeatedly to avoid miss during kiai and similar parts like that. I really like how well it feels playing this in this mode even if its not made for it.

- [AK X LYNX ft. Veela - Virtual Paradise](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/477725) by [alacat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/869782) (Nominator: [Kurokami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/260933))

This is a really good mapset where each difficulty has a common point which is the highlight of the kiai. The rest is mapped to be calm and easy to play while the kiai parts are requires fair amount of movement. I gladly support similar sets anytime.

- [Dancing Dolls - monochrome(Asterisk Makina Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/466238) by [koliron](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4632730) (Nominator: [Deif](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/318565))

This is probably the endurance challenge of these charts. The marathon mapped by koliron is a good example of a challenge, contrasting anti-flow patterns with some other milder ones. Don't let the general BPM fool you, your fingers will need to be ready to face this beatmap!

### osu!mania

- **[DragonForce - Symphony of the Night](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/478042) by [ajeemaniz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3027421)** (Nominator: [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717))

A great map from ajeemaniz! And not only in 4K, no. Is has even a 6K difficulty! The 4K difficulty begins with a pretty interesting long note usage follwing of some calm parts which switch again to pretty dense jumpstreams. The second half has a very interesting snap usage. With a lot of poly rhythm it requires pretty accurate play and the ending of the 4K difficult combines everything from before in one part! Dense jumpstreams, long notes and poly rhythm. Who needs a even harder challenge should try the 6K difficulty. It combines over the whole map everything from the 4K difficulty just with even more complex long notes and more jacks.
Overall for me both difficulty's are the highlight of the month November!

- [Toromaru - Shounen wa Sora o Tadoru Prog Piano Remix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/453912) by [jakads](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/259972) (Nominator: [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737))

This jazzy map brought you by jakads and multiple guest mappers packs a punch with all sorts of things. The music's rhythmic structure tends to vary quite often throughout, and it is well accompanied by appropriate SVs and pattern usage. Some SV changes in the INFNITE difficulty are pretty challenging may get time to get used to, but it's very rewarding overall. If the INFINITE diff is too difficult for you, don't worry! The easier difficulties are also worth taking a look at.

- [Yooh - Ice Angel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/379365) by [pporse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4991434) (Nominator: [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737))

It seems that whenever pporse makes a new ranked map, it always appears on the mania charts. Since the days of Canmusic, pporse has gained an extensive amount of experience in mapping, and this map reflects that well. The map is structurally organized and keeps consistent with the music's growing intensity. Similar to his Yooh - Salvation (one of the maps in the previous month's monthly ranked charts), the patterning is pretty comfortable, so if you think you are pretty good at 7K, you might want to try this out!

- [P\*Light - Gekkou Ranbu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/382403) by [Spy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1217122) (Nominator: [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717))

A long journey finally ended. Spy made here a really well done mix of a 4K and 7+1K (8K) beatmap. I voted for this beatmap especially because of the two different key-modes in it. The 4K difficulties have a pretty well done spread where all kind of player, either beginner or already experienced player will have their fun.
The 4K Gravity difficulty gives a lot of variety but what i specially like are that the beatmap follows pretty good the pitch from the music what is pretty good to see at the ending where he added a lot of trills.

- [Last Note. feat.GUMI - Osanana Blue](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/283155) by [-Kamikaze-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783) (Nominator: [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737))

Kamikaze is back with his antimeta mapsets. In this map, along with a standard guest difficulty by Okorin, features 5K, 6K, and an 8K modes for those craving something other than the standard meta of keys. Kamikaze and the collaborators incorporate some slight SV changes with some tricky sections at times, but the overall chart is pretty simple in structure. If any of you are skilled enough in mania, playing this map on DT is also pretty fun!

- [Hermit - Dysnomia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/303999) by [-Kamikaze-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783) (Nominator: [Evening](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2193881))

Kamikaze takes a rather unconventional take on the mapping scene of osu!mania with a unorthodox song choice and patterning. Bringing a full spread of two different keys definitely broadens the scope of the audience reached. With complex patterns and sequences involving BPM speed ups and polyrhythms, I feel that this map may be one of a kind in the ranked category. The map mostly shines at the point where 8K Melodie de tristesse used quite experimental patterns (relative to the mapping scene in osu!mania) and was pushed to rank, feel that this may be a sign of more experimental map designed being pushed to ranked, it may be a good thing, maybe.

**The October 2016 ranking charts will end on the 20th December 2016.**
