Over the course of a month, we received 67 entries and there have been some amazing submissions, and now, their fates are in your hands.

We've set up a voting page over on the new site which you can access [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/2), and vote for your top 3 entries. The voting will last for 2 weeks ending on September 5th. Whoever wins will (subject to staff approval) have their entry accepted as the new osu!taiko mascot. Along with this, they will also receive an osu!artist forum title, 12 months of supporter and $50 store credit. Second place will receive 3 months of supporter and third, fourth and fifth place will each receive a month of supporter.

Good luck to all who have entered and happy voting.
