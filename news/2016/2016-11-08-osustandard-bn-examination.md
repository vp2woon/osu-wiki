Hey everyone! Some of you might be wondering how we **create the BN examination**. If you are one of those, keep reading, because Mao and I are about to explain the whole process from coming up with possible questions up to the actual mapmaking!

We will divide the whole process into three pieces:

- Collecting ideas
- Creating the map
- Correcting the exams

Let's start with how we **gather ideas for the exam**. There's no sorcery behind this – we simply discuss about possible issues in maps, just as they could happen in any other. We brainstorm until we've found a decent amount of ideas and write them down. To determine whether something is currently a hot topic, we work closely together with the QATs who are responsible for the Ranking Criteria. Going forward, we try to determine whether something is a major or minor issue, and whether it's obvious or not obvious for the modder to detect. Each issue is assigned a score depending on how we judge it in this way. Something else that is worth mentioning is that the BN examination in September was actually the first one to **feature a full difficulty spread** instead of 10 difficulty "snippets". We decided to do that because we think it's way more realistic to mod one full spread - when you mod a map, you probably mod all of the difficulties and not 10 small parts of those difficulties,, right? Like this, you can also adjust your modding due to the given context - something that isn't possible while modding snippets.

After having collected ideas, we proceed with the **mapping**. The way this is done can vary - some would map first and then insert the mistakes, or vice versa. This is actually the easy part of the story – the difficult one is to get rid of other, unintended issues, which could confuse the those taking the exam. The key is to make a spread, which represents every kind of difficulty well enough. It's important not to forget the lower diffs! We need to make sure that prospective BNs are also able to distinguish what's playable and what's not for a beginner.

Then we wait until you have sent us your exams.

After everyone has finished the test, we are the ones to work again: In September, we had about 90 tests to check. We worked closely together with Loctav, who was responsible for the multiple choice Part A of the test. Regarding Part B, we decided to divide the workload between us - Irreversible and Mao were each responsible for their own difficulties. The point system was designed to **award the applicants with many points for finding a major issue** (e.g. they got 3 points if they found a giant jump in the Advanced difficulty level) and **fewer points for finding smaller details like snapping or minor rhythm mistakes**. There were a **total of 40 points** achievable for modding all the difficulties and finding all the hidden issues. There were a further **10 points** available based on the **quality of the modding**. We call this section "**Judge's Impression**", and points were awarded based on the language that was used, the general content, but also whether the stuff pointed out was valid or not. For example, if the applicant found everything but their wording was either rude or without any explanations/suggestions, we only gave few points for the Judge's Impression. Obviously, if a modder's wording was perfect but the suggestions weren't valid, we didn't give many points either. Last but not least, we send every person who has participated their results.

This was our first time that we have created an exam for upcoming BNs. Something that we are aware of is that the releasing of the results was not done in the best way possible. There was a lot of confusion as to where and how you could get your personal feedback. We will definitely take more care of this in future tests, as it is important that people who didn't pass this time have a chance to improve as much as possible ready for next time. We would also like to let you know that Desperate-kun will support us in the future, as Mao and I are currently very busy with university. The next examination will happen within the next few months. We cannot say yet when it will take place exactly, but we are certainly giving our best that you will not have to wait too long before you can take the next exam.

We hope that this insight in the way how we work was enlightening for you! If you still happen to have questions, feel free to drop them in the comments or ask one of us directly.

—Irreversible & Mao
