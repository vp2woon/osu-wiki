Aspire returns for a second round. Mappers from around the world, prepare yourselves!

![](https://puu.sh/oTUdn/ce9faf4bbe.jpg)

Due to overwhelming demand, we've decided to bring the contest back for a second run, pitting the best creative minds of the mapping community against each other in an almost-everything-goes design free-for-all!

We introduced the mapping community to IAHN (one of our licensed artists) a little while ago with a monthly beatmapping contest for the track *Candy Luv*. Little did anyone know that his cutesy sound exterior was but a ruse, and that he was hiding some *serious* musical grit all along. The track for this iteration of the Aspire contest will be a new track from him, titled **Transform**.

You can listen a preview of the track below:

*(This is a preview of the actual track, not the whole track included with the beatmap itself.)*

The rules of this Aspire contest variant is as follows:

- The contest accepts only **osu!standard** mapsets.
- **The map must be able to be completed without the NoFail mod required to pass it**. Completion is considered as being able to pass the track without failing it - not FCing (full-combo) it!
- **The map must be of a difficulty level where reasonably skilled players (think 30k+ rank) can complete it with significant effort.** This means that yes, your map may be *very* difficult, but not insurmountably difficult. No Apparition wannabees, please!
- That's it!

*(The difficulty rule is deliberately vague. We want to encourage mappers to break the current mold of difficulty = creativity. Intelligent use of everything at a mapper's disposal (storyboards, backing videos, .osu file editing, hitsounds, timing sections, etc) is what we're looking for over maps that are exceptionally difficult.)*

The standard Ranking Criteria does **NOT** apply. Mappers are completely free to pursue whatever they envision for the song. Mapping techniques such as "2B" are also allowed. A good example of many of these "fringe" mapping techniques is expressed in the popular "Debug" difficulty of [aran - Graces of Heaven](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/366028) mapped by [rustbell (aka: spro)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/rustbell).

The winners of the contest will receive the following prizes:

- **1st place:** 6 months of osu! supporter, unique *"Aspire 2016"* profile badge, osu!news showcase featuring their winning entry and an *'Elite Mapper: Aspirant'* forum title, mapset enshrined forevermore as an "Aspire" class Approval map.
- **2nd place:** 3 months of osu! supporter
- **Honorable Mentions:** 1 month of osu! supporter

Yes, you did read that right - any map impressive enough to warrant an honorable mention by verdict of the judges will receive a prize. There's no excuse to not get involved and give it your all.

Get the pre-timed osz file and submit your entries [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/contest?c=22).

**If you plan to submit a storyboard or any other extra resource (hitsounds, video, etc) with your entry, you will need to package the resources in a zip file and put a link to said zip file in your entry notes when submitting.**

Entries will remain open for 31 days from the date of this post - so get cracking! Judging may take up to two months from the date of the entries closing, but we will endeavour to get our results out ASAP.

Remember, use *everything* at your disposal. Storyboards, hitsounding, timing points - everything that the game gives you the means to use is at your fingertips. This is no ordinary beatmapping contest - so don't submit ordinary beatmaps!

Good luck!
