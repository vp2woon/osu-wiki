Hello again. This week has been rather interesting with a brand new game being born, a new orange overlord and more MWC goodness for those of you who missed the weekend festivities.

**Over the past few months, there's been a lot of talk about Lazer**. Recently, peppy took a small step back to test some recent framework changes he's been working on with smoogipooo to make a [small game](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/148831410818/a-little-framework-test). The game was designed to be a test for the new framework, and it appears to be a success. The game was created in 5 hours using under 400 lines of code! If you'd like to try this game, head over to peppy's blog and download the game for yourself. peppy has also said that this little game will most likely make an appearance into osu! sometime in the future.

**Also congratulations to [shARPII](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/776257) with getting promoted to GMT Manager and earning himself an orange title**. shARPII does have a few changes planned for the GMT which are still hush hush at the moment. For the time being though, if you have any questions about the GMT, feel free to contact shARPII as he should be able to answer any questions you may have.

**Back in [osu!weekly \#69](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-07-27-osuweekly-69), we showcased a video showing 49 different people playing Airman**. Well recently, [Nevo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7451883) has done a similar thing with [WEAVER - Kuchizuke Diamond](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/808848?m=0). The video contains replays from players like hvick225, Tokichii, NerO and \_index.

**[Drafura](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/326099) has created an alternate program to AIMod called [Navosu](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/489866).** The program is still rather new only hitting the forums in the past day or so, but is already receiving a bit of attention. According to Drafura, its main objective is to check for a maximum amount of rules/guidelines in a mapset and generate customizable modding posts. Navosu also comes with a lot of neat features with more of them planned to be added at a later point in time.

**Reddit user ciganyosu has revived an old weekly highlight going over impressive plays by some of the top osu!standard players**. [This week's issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/4xn79t/this_week_on_rosugame/) covers [Rafis's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) 693pp play on Nanamori-chu*Gorakubu - Acchu~ma Seishun! \[Fycho's Seishun\] using DoubleTime and Hidden, [Wilchq's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2021758) 485 pp SS on ALiCE'S EMOTiON - Dark Flight Dreamer \[Dreamer\] with Hidden and Hard Rock and [Cookiezi's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493) 618pp play on kradness&Reol - Remote Control \[Max Control!\] with DoubleTime and Hidden. The thread also covers many other replays from throughout the week, some which come with video links so be sure to check that out!

**Recently, [kang](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2180003) has started hosting the [STAR LEAGUE 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/488220) tournament for osu!mania**. The tournament will be using a single elimination format for osu!mania 4K players with a prize pool of $1000. It's also worth mentioning that this will be an invitational tournament. There will be 3 waves of invites. The first set of invites were sent out on the 10th of August, the second set will be sent out on the 17th of August and the final set will be sent out on the 3rd of September. Matches will commence on the 17th of September as to avoid any conflict with the current MWC4K 2016.

**osu!mania 4K World Cup Round of 16 has concluded with all 16 teams being separated into the upper and lower bracket**. Brazil, France, Indonesia, Japan, Poland, South Korea, United Kingdom and United States advanced to upper bracket of the Quarterfinals while Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland moved to the lower bracket. The osu!mania 4K World Cup 2015 Winner United States, along with Brazil, Japan, Poland and South Korea advanced to next round with clean 5-0 wins.

**That being said, Japan stole the spotlight with their triple Flashlight Hard Rock performance during their warm up against Switzerland**. The result was only a single miss coming from [inteliser](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1824775) who somehow managed to obtain a very impressive 99.60% accuracy with only 316 300's and over 1000 rainbow 300's!

<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Not too much to look at, is there?</i></p>

**Meanwhile, over on the Canada vs Poland match**, Trickstarz became the closest map in the Round of 16 as Poland managed to take back their lead after Canadian player [GameControl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5185455) unfortunately missed near the end of the song.

**Speaking of Trickstarz, that map was a clear favorite of the round getting picked 7 times and getting banned once**, meaning it had an appearance at every match during the weekend! Strahv and Sounds of Summer were right behind though, each getting picked up 6 times which is closely followed by Calamity Fortune with 5 picks. The bans showed a slightly different story with Liberi Fatali getting banned 5 times and Taekwonburi not far behind getting banned out 3 times.

**Next week should be where the fun starts though with teams now facing elimination in the lower bracket**. We'll also have some incredible matches that one could expect at the finals, so be sure to head over to the wiki to see the weekend schedule. Also don't forget you can head over [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1GSFF2W81heDb8oTdrp_R-w4sTNBvf3tv0Rdmpxsw_U0/pubhtml) to view the stats from the Round of 16, or head over to the store to purchase a [MWC banner](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/150) to show support to your favorite team. Also as a final gift, [Xiz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2384728) has created a rather interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heh7rv-wpcY) for the United States MWC team. So if you're a fan of all things silly, this might be the video for you.

But that's all from us this week.
