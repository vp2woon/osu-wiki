Time went by pretty fast! One year ago, we started with giving individual community members the opportunity to select beatmaps for the Monthly Ranking Charts. For this occassion, we prepared a [spreadsheet full of statistics for you](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KIp8VROr59EuECLo5KXjnrcKaH4gQZZrkCGc6vTF8n8/edit?usp=sharing). There you can check the past Ranking Charts and interesting information about them: chosen maps, chart winners, selectors - all at one place! Do you want to have more information about the charts and have ideas what could be added to the overview? Tell us in the comments and we will consider it!

With that being said, we are heading to the current Ranking Charts for April 2016 which have been released yesterday and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1604)!

This month [Andrea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/33599), [S a n d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/676578), [Kingkevin30](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/564334) and [_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750) picked the maps for the Monthly Ranking Charts.

## Ranking Charts Creation

The charts have previously been created by letting four dedicated community members select the most noteworthy maps of this month. We also reward the top beatmap in each category by providing **1 month of supporter status** to the mapper.

### osu!

For osu!, we decided to let **[Andrea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/33599)** pick their favourite maps.

- **[Komiya Mao - (can you) understand me?](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/409898) by [Okoratu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405)**

What to say about this beatmap, it's simply perfect in my opinion! The somehow mystic feeling that this song
gives fits perfectly with the whole mapset, every difficulty flows and plays in a really fantastic way. Despite
having many guest difficulties, every difficulty gives an unique feeling and feels comfortable to play! Also,
another thing which I really appreciated is the use of jumps, which is adapted perfectly and never goes too far.
I completely suggest you to play this beatmap if you haven't done that yet! You will love every difficulty.

- [Koda Kumi - Lick me](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/214243) by [Tony](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/404169)

This is quite an old style beatmap which nowadays still plays perfectly and flows in a great way as well! You can
see how much effort the mapper has made since the mapset is made fully made by him, but that's not all! The
difficulties also uses a really balanced setting in order to make the mapset to be enjoyable by all kind of players.
Another thing which I really liked about this beatmap is the background choice, which in my opinion fits with the
song title quite well! It makes you hungry and gives you the energy to play the beatmap at the same time!

- [sana - Kotonoha Clinic](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/419189) by [Kite](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/134572)

A really cute and adorable song accompanied along by an also enjoyable beatmap! I really love how the mapper mixed
the jumps and streams together, making this beatmap really fun despite the low BPM that this song provides. The
hitsounds also give a really nice touch along with the song! The best patterns that you will find in this beatmap
in my opinion are the jumps that goes back and forth, which also fits pretty well with the instruments in the song.
Another thing which you could also enjoy are the slider speed-ups that follows the high pitches of the singer's
voice. Give it a try and you will see!

- [Kicco - Lucky Monster](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/427413) by [Shioi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3044645)

Really fun map, seriously. Even though many people might find it generic, this beatmap provides a really nice amount
of jumps and streams which are well done and plays perfectly with the song. The background and hitsounds are quite
simple, yet they give another nice touch to the whole beatmap! The only thing which made me a bit sad is that the
guitar part didn't get mapped, I think if that part would've been mapped the map would've been even more fun!
Though, as I already said, the map is quite fun already, that's also why I'm mentioning it here!

- [DJ S3RL feat. Tamika - Rainbow Girl](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/67105) by [[Te][Amo]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/602695)

This beatmap is simply a masterpiece. Even though most of you might find the beatmap a bit simple and easy, the
storyboard makes this something incredibly awesome! It's just spectacular how this beatmap plays well along with
the storyboard, hitsounds are also well placed and sounds great along with the song. If you have played this beatmap
already but you have disabled the storyboard, I suggest you trying the beatmap with it, you will get a whole new
experience. Seriously, I wish there were more maps like this!

- [Kano - Dear Brave](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/390668) by [Fycho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1876867)

We're getting many Kano's beatmaps lately but this one feels quite special if we compare it to the others. Just
like the difficulty says, Special difficulty of this mapset plays really great and the jumps are really fun and
challenging, making this beatmap a blast to play. Even though some jumps/patterns might be harsh in some parts,
the beatmap still stays fun and gives a quite nice challenge. If you love to play jumpy beatmaps, this one is
completely made for you! Don't miss this chance.

### osu!taiko

For Taiko, we asked **[S a n d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/676578)** about their favourite maps in April 2016.

- **[DJ YOSHITAKA - FLOWER](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/339001) by [Lost The Lights](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1255920)**

This map is without doubt not just my favorite out of all April maps, but also my favorite Lost The Lights' map. As a song that prevails in pretty much every single music rhythm game, FLOWER has been mapped over and over, and without doubt, this is the best version I have played so far. Why? Because the satisfactions I get from spamming those 1/6 and 1/4 streams is still fresh every time I replay this map. The combination of well placed structures (such as swings and exceedingly long streams), and color allocation to each and every notes flows outstandingly well; hence, creates the art of this map. For new players this map is perfect for alternation and reading practice, for end game players this map is perfect for double time stamina practice, and as of Taiko World Cup, this map is a perfect selection for free mod bracket.

- [An - Tephereth](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/364132) by [SKSalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3280542)

As the performance point farming map "x.U." was ranked about the same time as this beautiful map, most of the attention was unfortunately shifted away making it one of the most underrated map of this month. I'm not going to talk about how people have made the lyrics of this song of elegance into something inappropriate <strike>although I died laughing</strike>. This map has a very interesting difficulty curve, as we can see the sudden explosion of the long streams in the later kiai that made most players suffered. Each streams flow nicely to one and another, the drum emphasis with the kat intervals, and the sound of these patterns melting with the beauty of this song. A very well deserved second place. SKSalt really has a talent in mapping An's song.

- [Imperial Circus Dead Decadence - Uta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/410162) by [lolcubes](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/578401)

Awwww yissss, satisfying long stream spams with complex patterns, my favorite. Despite this song being almost 9 full minutes, I enjoyed every part of this. The following of the background drums on 03:19 is repetitive, but perfectly suiting and isn't boring at all. The easy but suiting 1/2 patterns on the second last kiai is one of the best role models of how finishers should be placed! I have always respected long stream mappers due to how time consuming it takes to make a stream that flows with the song. It is easy to spam random don and kat, but in order to make the sound of stream merge with the song while having it played with a nice flow is a whole different story, which lolcubes did exceedingly well on.

- [SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Gemie - x.U. (ETIA. Hardcore Bootleg Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/356367) by [Nishizumi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2496768)

Starting with the 1/6, none of them are miss placed or over mapped on purpose as it suits the song very well. The doublets and quadruplets in the second kiai and second verse follows the music flawlessly, it plays very well too. As a speed change lover, I love the use of sv (slider velocity) in this map too, especially in the last kiai where it emphasizes the climax of the song with great build ups in the very end. It adds challenge on reading, and more dynamics to the map. If we can stop hating this map for how much performance point it give, that'd be great.

- [Sleeping With Sirens - If You Can't Hang](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/409025) by [Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2239480)

<strike>Because you are such a pretty pretty pretty pretty map.</strike> The way Raiden has mapped the kiai to entirely follow the drum sound creates a very nice emphasis on the sound of kat. Another thing to mention is how he has made every single kiai gradually increase in density which really got me high when I was playing the last kiai. Also, the way he has emphasized the "pretty pretty pretty pretty face" with repetitive triplets really adds a nice flow when playing. This map made me feel like I went from a pathetic keyboard Taiko player to a professional drummer. wow, much drum, very professional, many nice job, good Raiden.

- [senya - Yozakura ni Kimi o Kakushite](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/365251) by [Surono](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3611370)

I was quite disappointed on the previous map set on this song because of how easy it was. But this time Surono has done a great job on making up the difficulty, but also with an amazing flow in kiai. The whole map has a very very very well created structure, the color combination is well fitting too. I wouldn't be surprised if I ever see this map on Taiko no Tatsujin arcade because of how nice of a rhythm this map has. A great map for beginner to practice with simple 1/6 reading in the first part, and in later section would be great for familiarizing with different color combination. Again, I have to compliment on how good of a structure this map has, great job Surono.

### osu!catch

For osu!catch, **[Kingkevin30](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/564334)** was the chosen one to declare the winners of the April 2016 beatmaps.

- **[NeLiME - CODE NAME : ZERO](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/148238) by [ursa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/321063)**

This map is filled to the brim with intriguing gameplay design, its clever use of spacing concatenates a series of interchanging Dashes, Hyperdashes & Tapping movements. It really drives home the sensation of the frantic nature of this song. Spread-wise it feels very consistent throughout, it's challenging enough to not bore more experienced players, as well as not hitting new players with a brickwall of difficulty.

- [Comedian Harmonists - Perpetuum Mobile](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/316390) by [Bonsai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/987334)

When I first saw this Map being ranked I was quiet suprised, at first thought I thought it was supposed to be another Meme-like Map with odd Patterns and unconventional Difficulty settings. But it actually worked exceptionally well with its source material and intrigued me with how it used the vocals of the sextet to create close jumps that resemble the nature of close harmony arrangements.

- [sana - Kotonoha Clinic](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/419189) by [Kite](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/134572)

I couldn't keep myself from smiling while playing this map, with its chirpy though relaxing tone it gave a lot of possibilty for interesting patterns, and I wasn't dissapointed. From jumps in quick succession, Streams and Stream-walks it was a delight to play. It may not be challenging to some players, but it is still a heck of fun to play.

- [kors k - Playing With Fire (Sota Fujimori Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/202252) by [xlni](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1047883)

Not only did I recently have a chance to go wild on a Kors K perfomance on a Event. But also on the "Mapping-Floor" this fast past song kicked me right out of my socks with its stream and jump-heavy sections it definitly needs a lot of quick reactions and focus to get through. So put on your seatbelts and LET'S GET THIS PARTY STARTED!

- [Sakamoto Maaya - Okaerinasai (tomatomerde Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/395642) by [Rizen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3056732)

Not only can this map boast for itself with a beautiful Storyboard, but also as Convert map it stays true to its DnB roots, I especially like how the triple-notes and streams give the song a kind of baseline feel.

- [Kana Nishino - Darling](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/431087) by [Fii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3922569)

As one of the slower maps on my selection this map won't be a powerhouse or a big challange to players, but what it does essentially is to use the acoustic guitar and the background clapping to give it a coherent light hearted feeling. So if you're in need for a relaxing, fun mapset, then get comfy and enjoy.

### osu!mania

For osu!mania, **[_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750)** was able to select their personal most noteworthy beatmap from last month.

- **[aaaa - Bokutachi no Tabi to Epilogue.[Long ver.]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/381334) by [Daikyi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/811832)**

If I were to name a brilliant 4K beatmap off the top of my head, Bokutachi no Tabi to Epilogue would be among my first thoughts. Daikyi spent many hours polishing every aspect of the map, which resulted in a true masterpiece. The song itself is beautiful yet really complex, with many BPM changes, irregular rhythms, calmer and faster parts. However, Daikyi utilised all of the opportunities given to him. I especially like the fact that he didn't hesitate to use unorthodox, tricky patterning, rarely found in most of the ranked beatmaps. While the slower parts are filled with delicate chords, long notes and grace notes, the more lively ones feature well-placed minijacks and fast streams with polyrhythms and bursts, which feel like the hands have been made for them. The climax of the file are two 240 bpm 1/4 streams with doubles and triples, which play exceptionally well despite being rather difficult. This breathtaking journey lasts six minutes, and to be honest, I'm pretty upset it isn't longer. I wish there were more beatmaps made with this degree of mastery and consistency.

- [ginkiha - Anemoi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/381397) by [[ A v a l o n ]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4632359)

This is an example of a simple, well done beatmap. The mapset consists of six 4K difficulties, catering to audience at all skill levels. It is worth to note that Rizqy's and Ichigaki's guest difficulties have different background than \[ A v a l o n \]'s. Both of those mesmerising pictures complement the soothing and calm nature of the song. Speaking about the map itself, it is mainly chord based, although there is a good amount of long notes which test finger independence and releasing accuracy. \[ A v a l o n \] made a very solid, balanced map, which is a pleasure to play through.

- [Lite Show Magic - TRICKL4SH 220](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/368451) by [MeowPaz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1454484)

The best word to describe this 4K beatmap is 'agressive'. Running at 220 beats per minute, TRICKL4SH 420 definitely tricks players with rigid patterning requiring a good amount of reading capabilities as well as extraordinary control and speed. ZZH's Normal and Hyper difficulties are a good way to introduce weaker players into the world of more dynamic gameplay with quick bursts and fast-paced streams. In turn, Another and victorica's ExTrA unleash the full momentum of the song by clever usage of minijacks, short long notes and one-handed trills. The high-quality slider velocity changes give a unique feeling to this beatmap. All things considered, TRICKL4SH 420 is a great addition to ranked beatmaps roster.

- [onoken - children's domain](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/371198) by [Elementaires](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2284328)

Finger independence is one of the hardest skills to master. With that being said, children's domain is an excellent, short map to practice on. It only consists of two 9K difficulties, Easy and Normal. The beauty of this map lies in its simplicity combined with conscious pattern usage. Elementaires managed to express the peaceful nature of the song by paying much attention to pitch relevance. In the result the patterns are intuitive and easy to hit. The little fingers are used frequently throughout the map in a sensible way, teaching players to focus and control their hand movements properly. If you are picking up 9K and wondering what beatmaps you should play, seek no further!

- [P*Light - Gekkou Ranbu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/382668) by [Fresh Chicken](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3984370)

Another 4K mapset in the Ranking Charts, Gekkou Ranbu is one of the more conventional mapsets. Fresh Chicken's deep knowledge about comfortable patterning makes the hands flow on the keyboard. However, you are wrong if you think you can full combo this beatmap on your first try with ease! The main dish here are the broken streams combined with long notes, followed with a long, dense 186 BPM jumpstream. In order to get good accuracy across all difficulties, player needs to memorise the complicated rhythm of the song and withstand the heavy layering, especially on the EXHAUST difficulty. As a whole, this mapset is rather fun, and certainly deserves a place on this list.

- [Ayane - GO Love&Peace](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/356968) by [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717)

Ranked on 1st of April, this beatmap is NOT a joke! This mapset consists of only two 4K difficulties, Easy and Normal. The amazing song choice paired with natural, pleasant patterning resulted in a great map for beginners. It contains a great balance of everything an easy map should contain - single notes, doubles, long notes and steady rhythm. It's not flashy, because it doesn't need to be. Nothing else needs to be said about this beatmap, really fun and well-thought choice for beginners.

**The April 2016 ranking charts will end on the 15th June 2016**. For the next month, we will elect new community members to pick their favourite beatmaps, so stay tuned!
