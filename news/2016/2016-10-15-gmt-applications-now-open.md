Over the past few months, we've been trying to get more in touch with the community as a whole. As a part of these efforts, we are now accepting applications from anyone who wishes to join the Global Moderation Team.

The Global Moderation Team is one of osu!'s oldest usergroups, dating back to shortly after the game went public. The team has traditionally held some of the most esteemed members of the community within its midst (Ivalset, Sinistro and others) - people who have demonstrated that they are capable of far more than just being a moderator. The GMT are responsible not only for moderating the community at large, but for leading discussions and entire subsets of the community. They are the first people to talk to in-game should you have any issues or problems that you need help with.

Put simply, they are the first line for keeping the community pleasant for everyone.

For as long as the GMT has been around, there has always been confusion about how to join. What do I need to do? Who do I talk to? Previously, members of the GMT were only added through a mixture of statistical analysis and recommendation/nomination from other members of the team. From now on, we'll also be taking applications from members of the general community that feel they are suited to take on the position. We've set up an [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYVoAWscyXVXy2Ns8fjX8ALprgxNLHGZ_rCYuACzKGes94RQ/viewform) for that express purpose - if you're interested in becoming a member of the GMT, head on over and apply.

There are a few key points to note as well:

- Entry requirements for the GMT have not changed. To clarify, you must be very active on both the forums and via IRC/in-game chat. You must also regularly contribute to in-game reports, and must also speak passable English.
- You must also have impeccable standing on your osu! account. This means that anyone who has had a recent restriction or multi-account offense within the past year likely does not qualify to become a GMT at this time. Silences will be handled case by case per user, but you should still not have very many of them.
- Successful applicants will be required to maintain an acceptable level of activity in order to remain in the GMT.
- Please also be aware that this application system will work differently to the BN applications. This is only an application form and not a test. By filling out and completing the form, you are not guaranteed a seat in the GMT. We will contact you if we want to speak to you further.

**To clarify, there is not a certain number of "seats" or positions going for the GMT. If we think someone has what it takes, we'll add them. There's no competition for any sort of position.**

As osu!next draws closer, we'll be making more efforts to get the community involved again. A big part of the rework involves not only redesigning the website and game client, but also how the community operates as well. We're very big on letting the community guide the course of the game, and it is our hope that by expanding the team with fresh new faces and outlooks, we'll be better able to achieve this going forward.

If you have any questions or concerns about anything involving the application or the GMT itself, please [feel free to contact me](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/776257) via private message or in-game chat. Don't be shy!

Your community needs you, so get to it!
