First teased during last month's development meeting, we're delighted to introduce you to one of osu!'s newest featured artists - [Loki/Thaehan!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/7) Why the slash you ask? Well, he's two in one!

Hailing from Bordeaux in France, **Loki/Thaehan** is an incredibly talented musician that already sports a pedigree of maps made to his tracks by members of the community. His twin identities split cleanly between his two very different styles, with **Loki** specialising exclusively in metal of a symphonic twist, and **Thaehan** focusing on a racing, chiptune-electronica sound.

Don't believe it?

Here's a sample of his work as **Loki**, with a distinctively symphonic twist on metal:

And here's a taste of his work as **Thaehan**, sporting the aforementioned chiptune-fuelled sugar rush:

You can read more about **Loki/Thaehan** over at [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/7), and even download dozens of his tracks already timed and ready to be mapped!

We think that a huge number of people will be drawn to his variety across both his identities, and we hope to see more of his amazing sound mapped by the community at large. There's something for everyone in his amazingly varied sound, so make sure to give his tracks a good listen.

As with all Featured Artists, all of the tracks on his listing are completely free to use for anything related to osu! - videos, storyboards, podcasts, tournaments - if it's osu! related, it's fair game.

If you love **Loki/Thaehan**'s work, don't hesitate to [visit his Bandcamp](http://loki2.bandcamp.com/) and show him some support!

With Loki/Thaehan's addition comes a number of upgrades to the Featured Artist listing as a whole - you can now see which tracks are the coveted "osu! exclusives" that we spoke about during the reveal of the feature - special tracks made exclusively for osu! in mind! Support for full albums have also been added, making finding songs of a similar sound much easier than before.

Keep your eyes and ears peeled as well - there's more artists coming very soon!

And by soon, I mean *very* soon.
