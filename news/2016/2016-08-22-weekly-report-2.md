Hello! New additions to the Beatmap Nomination Group are always an interesting topic amongst the modding and mapping community, mostly because that is generally a synonym for more qualified mapsets in the next days. Be sure to check out the results!

**New osu!standard nominators have been added:** After correcting all the tests, we finally have the official results of the users that passed. Please give a warm welcome to [Lasse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/896613), [Spaghetti](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4761930), [Stjpa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2954693), [Len](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1686145), [Ayyri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7182318), [Kagetsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6203841), [Cryptic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3728904), [Strategas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2971837), [Electoz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6485263), [Kencho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178411), [Xexxar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2773526), [ezek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/180241), [sahuang](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5318910), [Zero__wind](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1822830), [Pentori](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7452237) and [MrSergio](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2581696)! Also do not forget to say 'Hi!' to [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) and [Sieg](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1404615), who has rejoined the group. There were a total number of 17 candidates that managed to reach the required pass threshold, although not all of them have accepted the invitations to join the nominators yet. Expect more people to join the Beatmap Nomination Group in the next days!

**Test results of the nominators who participated are also out:** From the 21 nominators that participated in the test, 13 of them showed that they improved since the last months and managed to successfully pass it! The nominators that failed the test or declined to participate have been removed from the group already. Nevertheless, we would like to see you active again in the near future, and we would also like to thank you for your participation in the beatmap ranking process in the past months!

**Further changes in the Ranking Criteria have been discussed recently:** Especially in the area of osu!standard, where the responsible members were centering their attention to the lower difficulties of a mapset. As an example, there will be clear instructions on how to handle overlapping structures, eventually mild jumps and short sliders.

## Ask us anything!

Some more interesting questions were posted in our blog in the past few days. Do not hesitate posting more of your concerns or questions [here](http://osuqat.tumblr.com/ask)!

- **There is awesome work on “Code of Conduct: Modding and Mapping” do you have or plan making something similar for the public teams like QAT, GMT? For community managers?** There is already something similar to the Code of Conduct for the members of the GMT and also for the QAT. Those are just simple guidelines on how to proceed with most of the known cases, but they will stay private mostly due to data protection. Community Managers do not need such guidelines as the number of members is quite small compared to the other groups and all of them have specific and concrete tasks in osu!. Nevertheless they communicate to each other before taking any relevant decision.
- **Hello there! Sieg here. Interesting to know if there any sort of communication besides the monthly meeting between the qat, rc team and the devs? Don’t you think it would be nice to promote some requests from the mapping community directly to the devs?** Most of the communication between the teams was ported to our Discord servers. The mapping and modding community along with the nominators and the QATs are lurking in the osu! Modding Association server hosted by OnosakiHito. You should contact any nominator or QAT if you are interested in joining in there. Apart from that, anyone can join the public dev Discord server to have a direct communication with the team, directions can be found by following the link to the [ppy blog](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/148279197878/come-join-us-devs).

That would be all from us for this week. Keep using the “Ask us anything!” feature of this blog if you have some more questions about our activity. We will be looking forward to answer them!
