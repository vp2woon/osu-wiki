Time to dust off those pens and get that creativity flowing! We're back with another special contest - this time for the intrepid artists among us. We're challenging you to design the new osu!Taiko mascot!

Over the years, we've had multiple people assist with mascot designs. Sarumaru for pippi, crystalsuicune for pippidon, ztrot for Yuzu and Daru for Yuzu and Maria. But we'd like to replace our lovable pippidon with something more official, similar to how Ryuuta stepped down for Yuzu a few years back

What we're looking for in particular, is a full concept/design for the osu!taiko mascot. Currently, pippidon is our posterchild for the gamemode, but we feel that it is perhaps time for her to get a hard-earned vacation and join the rest of the team in the osu! Alumni.

You have free reign over the particulars of your design. Want a huge, hulking wardrummer named Sanchez? Go nuts. Want a schoolgirl called Monoka? That also works. Want to keep pippidon's legacy alive with a fresh take on the concept? That's okay too!

The winner of the fanart contest will receive:

- Their design accepted formally as the official osu!taiko mascot henceforth
- osu!artist forum title
- 12 months of supporter
- $50 store credit

Second place will receive 3 months of supporter. Third, fourth and fifth place will also receive a month of supporter each.

## Rules

- Everything in your image must be your own work! Don't steal anyone's art, and please don't "trace" anything either. Make your own pose.
- Don't include any copyrighted characters from outside of osu! Including your own original characters alongside osu! characters is fine.
- Images must be G-rated and safe-for-work.
- A full concept must be submitted. This includes name, date of birth, blood type (where applicable), approximate height and weight, and a general outline of their personality and hobbies.
*As a final note, please be aware that the administration reserves the right to request and/or make alterations to the winning entry.*
