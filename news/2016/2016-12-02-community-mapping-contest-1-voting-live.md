After going through hundreds of entries across all gamemodes, voting for the first Community Mapping Contest is now open. Get in and get voting!

[Check out the Community Contests portal page to find your favourite gamemode and start voting now!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests) Instructions on how to vote are available on each contest's page - read on if you'd like to see a little more of what took us so long to get this all out.

We were amazed at just how many people entered our brand new beatmapping contest. Over 400 unique entries were submitted across all of the game modes available in osu!.

Unfortunately, this overwhelming participation meant that we had to sit down and seriously consider the model we were going to use for voting. Previously, we'd considered keeping all maps open for voting across all modes, regardless of the amount of maps in the pool. This was quickly thwarted by a staggering 130+ entries for Expert tier in osu! alone, so we were forced to make a few changes:

All of the osu! entries were vetted and processed by a small number of people in order to whittle down the massive catalogue of submitted maps into a more competitive line-up, as we envisioned very few people ever bothering to assess 130+ maps individually before choosing a single map to place their vote in.

After this judging process, the number of entries was reduced from 130+ to 16. We kept all maps that we felt were competitive and of a higher quality compared to the other entries. This was also applied to most other gamemodes as well, in order to ensure that the voting was as fair as it could possibly be. The trimming is not quite so extreme in the other difficulty tiers, but some entries were dropped due to quality concerns in other tiers and modes as well.

We understand that this may come as quite the surprise to some entrants as they find that their entry isn't in the final voting pool. We're very sorry if this turns out to be the case, but we thank you for your contribution nonetheless. We'll be revising the format going forward to see if we can find a way to have everybody's entry looked at.

If you are taking the time out of your day to vote in this contest, thank you! We understand that it takes a considerable amount of time to do so, but your efforts are paramount in helping make this contest a success. Consider it a taste of what the previous MBC and Aspire judges have had to do!

We hope that you all enjoy some of the amazingly creative entries that people have put forward despite all this, and please don't hesitate to leave feedback in the comments on this post for how we could do things better in the future.
