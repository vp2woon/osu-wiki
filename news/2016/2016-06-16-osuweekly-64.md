Looks like we're back to covering community events this week! Several people have brought to my attention that members from the mania subcommunity have taken initiative to host an aspire contest of their own! In other news, it looks like flyte has assumed the fetal position. Read on to find out more!

**The osu! community is out and about making things happen again, this time with a cool alternative to the [aspire mapping competition for osu!mania player](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/5153471)**. For those of you who don't know, the aspire contest is a chance for mappers from all around the world to show off their creative prowess in a no holds barred competition. It's a great chance for new and exciting things to develop in the mapping community and all, but it's traditionally a osu!standard only contest due to judging limitations. If you think you're skilled in the arts of rolling out noodles by the bowl, you should go check it out!

**Elsewhere in the community, the Polish community it's own[4K mania tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/449692/start=0)!**  [_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/_underjoy) has went and gathered a group of people of his own to start up his own 1v1 tournament, and it has already progressed well into the brackets. I was told there have already been some [pretty close matches](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkN5rBqXEAA9YcG.jpg), so who knows what the tournament will still have in store!

**It looks like flyte has been up t-[oh dear](https://next.ppy.sh/post/145703170363/oh)...** Well, it looks like flyte's going to be out for a while. Even with the brains of the operation out for the count, the previews must continue! This time, we get a look at something that appears to be a profile page... but for what? Well, with flyte feeling like this, he's probably in no mood to explain. Maybe after he has stopped attributing his work to his life, he'll start feeling better!

**osu!mania is [getting revisited](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/466617/start=0) by smoogipoo with the help of our friends in the osu! community!** Ever since it was first created by [woc2006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/woc2006) a few years ago, the game itself seldom received an update save for a couple of minor tweaks and bug fixes. Since then, multiple initiatives have been made in attempts to update the game mode and improve the editor. This looks to be what is just the beginning of many updates to core gameplay to come! It is important to note, however, that everything currently in the cutting-edge build represents a work in progress and is not ready to become the standard. If you have any feedback, do leave your suggestions in the thread!

We have reached finals week for the osu!catch World Cup 2016!  Germany will face off with Indonesia in the winner's bracket while South Korea, United States, China and Argentina will go face to face in the Lower bracket fighting for their place in the top 3.

Indonesia continues their merciless rampage by knocking Argentina down to the lower bracket in one of the closest matches we've seen since South Korea vs Germany in the Round of 16. Indonesia were looking to take it 6-1 when all of a sudden, Argentina upped the ante and took to all the way to a tiebreaker. However, the Indonesian team turned things around and claimed their spot in the upper bracket Finals. After taking down some big teams like China (5-2), Hong Kong (5-1) and now Argentina (6-5), Indonesia are looking pretty good for a Grand Final position.

The other winner bracket Semifinal match was a battle between Germany and United States. An impressive start by United States saw them taking the first 2 points, but Germany equalized it by got the next 2 points. Both traded a win for 3 - 3, but Germany took the lead until 5 - 3. United States tried to catch the deficit by chose picked S-C-U - milky ice bear and the strategy worked well as most of the German team struggled to keep any sort of combo going. In order to force Germany to play Tiebreaker, United States tried their best on last map but were unable to pull through and ended up losing both the point, and the match.

The lower bracket was also the focus of many people as each match ended with the same score of 6-1. But in the end after the dust settled, South Korea and China emerged from the carnage and advanced to the Finals after taking out Hong Kong, Singapore, Poland and France. South Korea and China are both only 2 wins away from claiming a top 3 placing in the tournament. Will one of these teams make it all the way, or will United States or Argentina snatch it away from them!
