Greetings and welcome to the osu! beatmapping contest \#12
We just opened the submissions for the 12th Beatmapping Contest! This will be a osu! mode mapping contest, with an awesome song from IAHN

For the previous contest we had a energetic mix from the freedom planet games, this time we will be going for something new! From the artist IAHN  we have the track Candy Luv. You can listen to the contest song **[here](https://puu.sh/nailM/8ba731bc68.mp3)**

## What are the prizes?

- 6 months of supporter for you or a friend!
- 'Elite Mapper' forum title
- **Winning mapset will be bundled with the osu! game client download!**

## What are the rules?

- You must map 4 difficulties in an appropriate spread - either ENHI (easy, normal, hard and insane) or NHIX (normal, hard, insane, expert).
- Collaboration is allowed, but will only be registered under the name of the person who submitted the beatmap. Prizes for a winning mapset will only be given to the uploader.
- Difficulty names must only be the name of the respective difficulty, and nothing else. No ztrot's Hard or anything comparable.
- Maps submitted to the contest must not be submitted to the BSS until the contest has concluded.

## Where can I enter?

Submit your creations **[here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/contest?c=21)**

If you feel that the song is a little too long to properly demonstrate your mapping prowess, you can choose to enter the contest using the [alternate shorter version](https://puu.sh/nxSAW/63d35604a4.mp3)! Both versions of the song will be accepted for this contest.

The deadline for submission is the **April 3rd**. Make sure you submit early and be prepared - we won't be accepting late submissions!
