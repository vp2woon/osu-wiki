The first set of new "Hush-Hush" style medals are here at long last. Medal hunters unite!

Many months ago, we mentioned a number of new medals in development in the meetings posted on [peppy's blog](https://blog.ppy.sh). The Mod Spotlight medals released relatively quietly a few weeks back were just preparation for the big ones coming - and they're finally here!

We'd like to proudly present to you, the first portion of a new set of medals in the "Hush-Hush" style. For those unfamiliar with the concept, "Hush-Hush" medals are a mixture of riddles and gameplay skills. From experimenting with mod combinations, to little similarities in metadata, gaining these coveted medals is more than just simply following a set of instructions towards your goal.

At least, for those enterprising enough to try and discover things for themselves!

Previously, we didn't permit any mention of the ways of obtaining these elusive prizes. Going forward, **this is no longer the case, and we invite you all to work together to figure out how to obtain them!**

Trust me, you're going to need it.

**The medals will be rolled out gradually over the coming day to ensure everything is as it should be. [If a medal is visible on the new website under the Hush-Hush category, it's attainable!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2#medals)**

Many of these medals are for all the game-modes, but some are specific to standard mode only. We'll leave it up to you to figure out what's what! More mode-specific medals will be coming later on.

There's two *super* hard medals in this set that we expect only the best of the best will be able to obtain. Sorry, completionists! The others will need to be deciphered either by good riddle solving and experimentation, or perhaps just pure serendipity. You'll get these medals through actually playing the game, so don't bother trying to find hidden stuff in the client or anything like that!

In any case, we hope you enjoy these new medals, and look forward to seeing more of the same in the future. There's a bunch more planned, and we'll be going through player suggestions for medals at a later date for more ideas.
