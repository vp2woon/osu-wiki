Hang in there, we're still not quite back into gear with public updates yet! This week, we'll be once again taking a look at the various things the members of the community are setting out to do. Curious to see who's been doing what? Read on!

**The Polish osu!mania tournament, [MP4K](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/449692), has finally come to an end!** In the Grand Finals match, Hudonom defeated SitekX 8:7 after a strenuous battle. Both players carefully chose their picks in order to defeat their opponent, which resulted in a spectacular tie-breaker, in which Hudonom showed his terrifying skill and gained the title of Polish osu!mania Champion. After the match, there was a post-tournament exhibition match between Hudonom and Tidek, the latter being a map pool selector and thus unable to participate in the tournament. The final showoff of the tournament ended 8:4 in Tidek's favour.

**The [osu!dual cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/440204/start=0), a community ran 2v2 tournament, also came to an end this week.** To no one's great surprise, team No Title took home the grand prize with their exceedingly powerful lineup featuring some of the best players in the world. Regardless, it proved to be quite a spectacle, seeing some of the greatest players who ever lived remorselessly beat the other teams. You can check out some of those moments on their [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/osu_dualcup)!

**osu!mania Indonesia Cup #2 concluded the 7-Key category last Wednesday.** It looks like reigning champion Fiea took 1st place, new joiner asddada5 taking 2nd place, and Indonesia's osu!mania World Cup captain Nyooo snatched the 3rd place. You can watch full coverage of the match [here](https://www.twitch.tv/omic_live/v/77815866) if you're interested!

**It was brought to our attention that [kevin3333g](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/374950) has achieved 10000 first place ranks in Taiko!** Considering that we may not have that many more total ranked sets, this achievement is extraordinary beyond measure. Once again, its great to see players setting their own goals outside of the performance system!

**Lemmmy, one of our more regular contributors in the osu! Dev discord, has effectively written the [next osu!weekly](http://lemmmy.pw/weekly/69.html) for me.** I mean, I really can't tell the difference between this automatically generated article and the real thing! This article was generated using a technique similar to that of a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). While not directly something that contributes to our development in a meaningful way, it demonstrates the creative talent in our community to go out and do fun stuff. Keep up the good work!

Dusk successfully made a Hard Rock full combo on onoken - P8107 \[Nervous Breakdown\] (CLSW).

With this result, not only did he become the first player in all modes to reach 13K PP but also stretched the performance gap between him and \_Asriel to 1,049 points.

Dusk isn't the only outstanding player this week, \_yu68 also built a great performance gap with tasuke912 (1,039 points) after he made an astonishing Hidden and Double Time full combo on Yousei Teikoku - Hades:The end\[Inner Oni\] (lolcubes).

WindyS also made an impressive full combo on xi - Ascension to Heaven \[Elysium\] (Jinjin), a 5 minute song which is full of BMS patterns.
