**A big thanks to the following contributors for helping out with this week's issue:** [-KousakaHonoka-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/-KousakaHonoka-), [Raveille](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Raveille), [Xylo-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Xylo-)

**Even though mapping contests seem to be taking a small break at the moment, that doesn't mean you can't flex your creative muscles elsewhere!** Even though we seem to be slightly late to the punch, you can check out the recently concluded [Modhelp Mapping Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/493507) hosted by [Zexous](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1715876). It looks like Zexous has a similar love of trolling KwaN with bad capitalization in his posts! If you fancy a peek, go check it out in the results thread on the official discussion board.

**[AngeLMegumin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1777162) set a new global performance record with a groundbreaking 730PP play!** This jaw dropping metric was achieved on the map  [Chino(CV.Minase Inori) - Shinsaku no Shiawase wa Kochira! [Happy~!\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/953586?m=0). The play also barely edges out the previous osu!standard record set by Cookiezi almost 8 months ago, which was a staggering 727pp on Asphyxia's [BLUE ZENITH](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/658127?m=0).

**Following in nobody's footsteps in particular, the QAT is now doing [weekly blog posts](http://osuqat.tumblr.com/) in a style very familiar to us!** There seems to be further updates to the BN roster as we reach the end of another round of crushed hopes and dreams that come in the form of non-acceptance. If you have any questions for the QAT, it seems that they are answering questions submitted to them on their blog every week, so be sure to head on over and drop them a line!

**For the first time, we have a new [comprehensive storyboard showcase](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-09-09-storyboarder-showcase-4)!** This time, ephemeral stepped up to the challenge and our team created a cool compilation showcasing works from one of the most influential storyboarders of our time. If you haven't seen it yet, check out the official post for more information!

osu!mania 4K World Cup 2016 Finals Week 1 has just concluded with a lot of rivalries, unbelievable situations, and also tears.

Saturday's match opened with upper bracket Final match between World Champions United States against South Korea. They met each other last year during Round of 16 with United States dumping South Korea 5 - 0, but their success story wasn't repeated as South Korea revenged their loss by sweeping United States 6 - 0.

In the lower bracket, Japan met United Kingdom for the second time. United Kingdom, having lost 3 - 6 in last year's 3rd place match, tried their best to take advantage as Japan's [Snow Wind](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2163585) was not in good condition to take their own revenge. Tied up at 1 - 1, United Kingdom tried to take the opportunity by using Hard Rock mod, but it backfired and gave Japan an easy 4 - 1 lead. In order not to lose hope, United Kingdom tried everything they had and caught up with the deficit, but Japan managed to control the match as they won 6 - 3 and extended their head-to-head record to 2 - 0 in Japan's favor.

Brazilbeat out France with a 6 - 0 score and took revenge for their defeat last year against Japan with another 6 - 0 as Snow Wind couldn't keep up the game. The on-fire Brazil hardly found any difficulty when they were facing United States as they won 6 - 2, setting their head-to-head record to 1 - 1 as Brazil was defeated 2 - 5 earlier in Quarterfinal upper bracket. With these results, Brazil reach Grand Final for the first time and they will face South Korea in Grand Final

There has been a rivalry story between Brazil and South Korea -  back in osu!mania 4K World Cup 2015, Brazil was defeated 0 - 4 in Group Stage, but later Brazil kicked out South Korea from the tournament as they won 6 - 1 and now they will meet again for the 3rd time for World Champion title. Who will be crowned as World Champion and lead the head-to-head record, Brazil with their own new power or South Korea which is led by \#1 [jakads](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/259972)? Be the witness of the new World Champion only in [osu!live Twitch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) this Sunday at 1:30am UTC!

Honorable mentions go to Japanese player  [Snow Wind](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2163585) as he tried his best for Japan Team.
