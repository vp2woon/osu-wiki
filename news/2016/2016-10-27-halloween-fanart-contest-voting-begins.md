The submissions have closed, and the voting is now open. There's been some excellent entries this time around, so come and take a look!

We've got a number of incredible entries from our amazingly talented community artists, and we need your help to determine which ones get shown on the game's main menu during our upcoming Halloween event! Everybody gets **three** votes to choose their favourite entries, so make them count.

[Head on over to the contest page and make your votes!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/5)

We'll be choosing a selection of the community's favourite pieces and some choices from among the staff as well to feature in the game client over the course of Halloween.

Thank you to everybody who submitted an entry - if you find yours isn't in the voting, it's because your work was completely hidden by the osu!cookie or didn't follow the rules we posted with the contest. Oops!
