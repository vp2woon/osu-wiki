## Weekly News

**Our [annual christmas queue](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/522827) is back once again, thanks to the efforts of Yuii-!** The roster of modders ready to help get maps ranked for the holiday season seems to have grown by quite a margin since last year. What does it take to get a map modded by the dedicated holiday modding team you may ask? Well. a little contrary to its namesake, the Christmas queue is ready to take on maps that are winter, new year's, or Christmas themed. Do you have a map you want to share with the world, along with a little holiday spirit? Go see if you qualify!

**flyte has finally made his grand return to the public eye!** In case this is the first time you are joining us, the lead designer of our humble game maintains a development blog to let us get a glance at what goes on before production. To what do we owe the pleasure? This time, we're being treated to some [blurry screenshots of what appears to be the new chat interface](https://next.ppy.sh/post/153029306648/its-been-a-long-time-since-i-posted-the-last). If you love flyte as much as I do, head on over and let him know that he isn't alone!

**In a brilliant display of effort, [RAMPAGE88](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/448547) became the first ever osu!catch player to hit level 107 in that mode!** He is also the first one to pass the 200 billion ranked score milestone, and his ranked score is about 30 billion higher than the current 2nd place holder, Zak. Congratulations!

**There's an [ongoing vote](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/5578385#p5578385) in the Polish mania community to determine the top 10 polish mania players.** Not Polish? Fret not! The friendly contest is open to everyone to participate in for voting, so head on over to have your say!

**Barely missing the deadline for making it on the last weekly was this month's [development meeting notes](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/152849247453/2016-10-dev-meeting).** Though much has remained business as usual, we got a neat update on [modding V2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/485376/discussion#:1035104) as well as what's going on with the rapidly forming lazer build of the game. Do you find yourself wondering what up and coming features of the game are in store for the future? Be sure to follow the blog to catch up every month!

## Scorewatch: November Week 2

OWC action is underway, but what about some scores action? We have a couple of good ones this week!

[Atama no Taisou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/40344) has only been FCed by current Number 1 [Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493), but that has been absolutely overthrown by [Angelsim](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1777162), who FCed this with HR! His 98.38% run gave him 476pp, but the performance definitely says otherwise as this map is filled with Blue Dragon's squares. On the same map, [[ Emillia ]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2003326) managed to score a FC with HDHR and had 91.92%, giving him 438pp and the \#2 spot on the map. The below video showcases Angelsim's HR play. Check it out yourself! Sound warning at the end of the map, so be aware!

We associate maps with a lot of players. An example is [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) and [Fujijo Seitokai Shikkou-bu - Best Friends](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/574471?m=0). But, a new No.1 has claimed victorious on that map! [filsdelama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2831793) has sniped Rafis on that same map that once gave the Polish 666pp, and set a 99.06% HDHRDT 720pp score! Rafis tried to claim back his first position with a similar 720pp score, but to no avail. The French win this one... for now.

No.1 Chinese player [rustbell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/227717) went full Choppers mode and sniped [WubWoofWolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/39828) by a slight margin of 12,000 points on [Tech N9ne - Worldwide Choppers](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/137377). Although he didn't set the best accuracy thus far, he did set the highest no mod combo for a play. WubWoofWolf's play has been beaten after a whopping 1 year and 4 months at the top.

[inteliser](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1824775) has shocked the mania community with a breathtaking play of [xi -FREEDOM DiVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/473228&m=3), Fullerene's 4K DIMENSIONS, by using FLHR and FCing the entire chart. As a mania player writing this, I cannot believe what I've seen. You need to check this play out.

## OWC Week 1: Turbulent Group Stage

<img src="https://puu.sh/ru4PG/905269a358.png" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;"/>

Ask anyone who has staffed a tournament, and they will tell you that Group Stage weekend is the busiest of all. The players agree, the OWC staff agree, and literally thousands of audiences who may have sacrificed some of their sleep to tune in to our live stream agree. If you happened to have missed the matches – don't worry, you can find all streamed matches here.

This year, we are fortunate to welcome 32 highly skilled and talented teams from across the globe, presenting 32 distinct rosters stronger than ever. For this very reason, the week prior I predicted that we would see quite a few upsets during Group Stage. As it turns out, while all Top-seeded teams have made it out, the competition for the 2nd place in each group was fierce. Low-seeded Argentina in Group C fought hard and earned itself a ticket out, eliminating the High-seeded Mexico. USA, the defending champion, seemed to have quite some trouble in the very beginning, playing right into the Tiebreaker for 2 of its 3 matches. At the same time, Group H produced one of the tightest races for 2nd place – after having a rather rocky Day 1, the Low-seeded Hong Kong fought hard and won 2 matches, producing an upset against the United Kingdom and forcing an advancement decision of Group H made based on net maps-won. However, with a difference of 1 map point, Brazil secured the 2nd place and sent Hong Kong back home. You can look at the group stage statistics in details here.

An overview of Group Stage results

This upcoming weekend, we will observe the first round of matches in the Elimination Stage! With 8 intense and definitely entertaining matches to take place, you would NOT want to miss out (unless of course, you have a date, but we all know that's impossible because osu! players are destined to be forever alone). Be sure to come by and show your support for your favorite team!
