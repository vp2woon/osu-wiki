## How do I register?

- **[Click here to sign-up!](https://osu.ppy.sh/tournaments/4)**
- Do not create teams in advance! Teams will be formed after registration phase concluded by country's team captains.
- Hand in your registration before **28 February 2016.**

Note that you can only participate if you are of a **osu!taiko global ranking of #5000 or higher and did not violate the [osu! community rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months**.

If your registration was successful, you will be put on the candidate list of your country. Whenever a captain for your country has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

_Remember that any registrations past the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances - so get your registrations done early to avoid any last-minute issues._
