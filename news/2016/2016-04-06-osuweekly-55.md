Hello everyone, Deadbeat here with the weekly once again as Nyquill is unable to deliver the news this week. There are quite a few interesting things to cover this week, so lets jump right to it!

**[Ephemeral made a blog post](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/142289234118/2016-03-meeting-notes) summarizing an internal meeting to check up on what everyone is up to in the month of March!**  The meeting covered a variety of topics, including the long awaited modding V2. Despite meeting some hiccups in the process, [a lot of progress has been made!](https://puu.sh/o6R5O/e157138b09.jpg)

**Also discussed in the meeting, achievements- or medals as they'll soon be known as- are making a huge return with new achievements planned to be added weekly from here on out**.
The meeting also covered changes being made to the GMT, the current Catch the Beat editor, a brand new development branch that has been subbed "LAZER" along with a few other topics.

**[Nyquill has posted a new community poll!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/439440)** This time, we want to know whether or not you are an active member of our mapping community. There are options for just about any circumstance you could be in, so be sure to have your say for the final tally at the end of the month!

**There's a new face around town for those who play osu!mania**. While introductions may be a little late, say hello to Maria, the new osu!mania mascot!

Once again, -KousakaHonoka- has ventured into the community to seek out some impressive plays!

- **[Ttobas managed a HD SS on JBHyperion's Halozy - GO 4 IT [Shining Needle Parade]](https://puu.sh/o7rcn/87e01e9eff.jpg)**, a diff which has a lot of jump speed.
- **[ExKagii- finally got a full combo on Blocko's xi Happy End of the World [4K Insane]](https://puu.sh/o7rff/a4a772caba.jpg)** with only two 200s and an impressive 99.98% accuracy.
- **Even though he struggled a bit, [HappyStick managed an impressive HDHR full combo on Broccoly's cosMo@BousouP Oceanus [Divinity] difficulty](https://puu.sh/o7rde/4e55c9f1e5.jpg)**.
- **[1RoHa_ pulled off an astonishing SS on Nofool's sakuzyo Imprinting [Oni]](https://puu.sh/o7rgT/78de8e028f.jpg)** difficulty with HDNC.

**[The osu!Taiko World Cup 2016 Quarter-Finals have concluded!](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/TWC_2016#Quarterfinals_2)** Teams Hong Kong, Japan, Germany and Canada have advanced to the winner's bracket semifinals, knocking Indonesia, Poland, Argentina and the United States down to the loser's bracket. There, they'll join China, Taiwan, South Korea and the United Kingdom and battle it out. Which of the 2 teams will survive another week to earn their place at the finals? Better tune in this saturday to find out!

While we didn't see any double digit score gaps like last weekend, we still saw some rather close matches, the closest with China taking the win in the last few seconds on [Leaf - Chronostasis](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/beatmaplist?g=10) with a 9,676 point score difference in their match against Philippines

**[The increased difficulty of the Quarter Final maps really showed this time with a 0.96% average accuracy drop from the Round of 16](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gVHBZZpCMq2Ktvsr7KDeb_DBpN048TDjfZJW4c5JKzQ/pubhtml)**. We also saw the Hard Rock maps get a lot less love, going from 10 picks and 5 bans to only 4 picks and 7 bans. On the other side of things, we saw a lot of love for Free Mod, going from 7 picks and 1 ban to 14 picks and 3 bans.

**There was also a notable similarity in results with the Round of 16**. Both rounds having 4 matches end 5-0, however we did see a small difference in the other scores. With the number of teams slowly going down and stronger teams moving on in the winners bracket, we might just be able to expect some closer matches soon!
