Earlier last week, Peppy announced in a blog post his decision to expand the functionalities of the game as osu!next is well on its way: "I am amazed by the genius in my decision to supply Flyte unlimited quantities of Espresso and pin-ups of Nisekoi characters (specifically Onodera)," he adds, "(You) should have seen how fast he's been punching those keys and writing the codes."

The developer of the famous rhythm game has made his keen interest in the latest cutting-edge technologies apparent by announcing that he now looks to make VR devices a part of the osu! input methods collection. He raises that more and more households will choose to purchase Oculus Rift when people realize the equipment's potential, like how thousands did when the directors of Nekopara gave confirmation on the project's movement towards VR.

"If you have people who want to...fondle catgirls in VR, I say: 'Hey! Maybe people want to click circles in VR, too!' – And that's the future we're talking about," Peppy proudly asserts as he clicks his tongue while giving a wink.

When pressed about how exactly will Oculus Rift devices function as an osu! input method, the Australian-born game designer admits that he has yet to work out a comprehensive picture, but has "something cooking."

Probably the most widely-known game of its genre, osu! now boasts almost 8 million users. With many play styles and preferences in account, the osu! community constantly seeks ways to hone their skills.

"You have people who move the cursor using mouse. You have people who do that using a tablet stylus. And you have that Korean ctb player who somehow ends up in high 4-digits in osu!standard thanks to touch screen...god he's insane. So with those in mind, I thought you would definitely have nutwhacks who want to take it to the next level," says a completely sober Peppy.

According to the notes of the project, the VR input method will likely require the player to generate movements in the cursor through constant and undivided attention, or in plain terms as put on the paper, "using brain power." The player will experience a first person point-of-view of the cursor as it travels to and from hit-objects on screen. Especially noteworthy is the method to hit, which is done through having the player produce vowel-like sounds using their mouth.

With such a revolutionary input method incoming, it comes as less than surprising when opinions of disapproval are voiced from the community.

"This is horrible. It'll completely shatter all existing paradigms of mapping!" A panicking Charles445 warns as he holds onto a toolbox body pillow, "Peppy has got to re-think this!"

When pressed on the issue of opposition, Peppy reassures that nothing is set in stone yet: "We understand that we're far from reaching perfection, and we still need to hear from more of our players regarding this...but seriously guys it's not like if you fail a map here Oculus Rift will fry your brains out."

The interview is cut short when an exhausted but hyperactive Flyte crawls out of his room and demands ambulances to be called. According to the doctors who arrived on-site, Mr. Flyte has not slept in almost 96 hours.
