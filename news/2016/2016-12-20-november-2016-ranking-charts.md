The Ranking Charts for November 2016 have been just released and can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1611)! Their respective packs are available at the [Beatmap Pack Listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/packlist?t=r) for easier access.

## Ranking Charts Creation

The charts have previously been created by letting volunteers alongside the Quality Assurance Team select the most noteworthy maps of this month. We also reward the top beatmap in each category by providing **1 month of supporter status** to the mapper.

### osu!

- **[Tonon - Shirayuki ~sirayuki~](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/429316) by [yf_bmp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1243669)**  (Nominator: [-kevincela-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/266596))

Really interesting approach to underline the strong beats, using a low Slider Velocity to express the song's overall slow pace while using a very variable spacing to emphasize the very powerful beats, resulting in a very enjoyable beatmap which complements the song really well. The insane difficulty is also really solid, while the rest of the difficulties are also pretty nice while playing it safe.

- [Treyarch Sound - Abracadavre](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/406273) by [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) (Nominator: [Desperate-kun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405))

A great marathon mapset made by pishifat. 'Extra' is extremely consistent with its patterns, but still manages to be entertaining over the course of more than five minutes. The map's various concepts all add together to an exciting experience: The low Slider Velocity and Approach Rate, the constant movement required with only few breaks and the high circle size create a tension that fits very well with the powerful song. 'Insane' is more flowy for those who don't enjoy the harsh concepts of 'Extra'.

- [RADWIMPS - Nandemo Nai ya](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/515939) by [Monstrata](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2706438) (Nominator: [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418))

Here's a map designed around a narrative. It uses a concept of objects placed within certain areas of the playfield to relate the map to themes of the film _Kimi no Na wa._, wherein this song can be heard. Without giving away too many details, all I can say is that it's definitely a treat to experience.

- [P4koo(Vocal.rerone) - Fly High](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/490172) by [bbj0920](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/87546) (Nominator: [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087))

The winners of OMC do not disappoint with a very polished and well-done mapset. Despite the seemingly confusing rhythm at first glance, the winning difficulty, Insane, showcases its masterful usage of patterns to both improve gameplay and accompany the song beautifully. In characteristic Dailycare style, his difficulty just screams clean and structured. It's a surprisingly pleasant difficulty to play, with smooth jumps and streams all around. For something simplier, K i A i's Insane is similar in that it's also very well structured, but with a hint of an older style. A must-play for any one who wants to get a nostalgia kick! Moa's Easy is a really cool take on Easy difficulties, with clean structures, but also managing to spice up the usually-boring rhythm present in Easies as well!

Although not a participant, Kloyd's difficulty is just as amazing as the rest. One would think utilizing doubles in a Hard difficulty would be crazy, but he does it, and very intuitively at that! Similar to Kloyd, W h i t e's Normal isn't part of the contest, but its also done really well. In contrast to the unorthodox rhythm choices by Kloyd, W h i t e showcased a clean, and conservative Normal. The greatness lies in its simplicity. All-around an amazing collaboration set!

- [Nardis - Cosmo Memory](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/517598) by [Shiirn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/465126) (Nominator: [Desperate-kun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405))

The 'Extra' captures the complexity of the song perfectly by using various concepts and gimmicks, which all fit together impressively well. The contrast of low Slider Velocity and huge jumps in the choruses is well executed and a lot of fun to play. Despite all other difficulties being made by guest mappers, they fit together nicely and reference the gimmicks of the highest difficulty.

- [xi - ANiMA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/441271) by [Kalindraz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2313166) (Nominator: [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087))

With all 6 difficulties done solo, Kalindraz' first ranked mapset is really a cut above a regular 'first ranked'. Throughout the whole set, a clear geometric and symmetric design can be distinguished, making the set feel clean and cohesive. Although the rhythms expressed in the song might be somewhat difficult to represent, Kalindraz has done it well, with intuitive implementation from Easy all the way to Oberum Primus. A fitting entry in this month's charts.

### osu!taiko

- **[LeaF - Alice in Misanthrope -Ensei Alice-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/523315) by [S a n d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/676578)** (Nominator: [Ntiger](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766))

While November didn't have very many ranked maps, it had some exceptionally good and interesting ones, and this set - voted as most-noteworthy/best of this month - is definitely one of them. The reason for that is the highest difficulty "No Regret" and while it's supposed to be a reference to the song, I can safely say that this is a map S a n d does not have to regret making! There are many reasons for that: Very solid lower difficulties (Kantan, Futsuu, Muzukashii, Oni) followed by one of the most creative Inner Onis we have had in the ranked section. It has Slider Velocity changes, that already very well can be called a gimmick as there's just so many of them and they enhance the gameplay experience A LOT - take a look at the masses of green lines in the editor, if you want! Additionally to that, it features very well-done pattern-based mapping, with the map being connected in its entirety: Adding color variation as patterns repeat, inversing the colors of them and more. This is a great, ranked S a n d map you must have played!

- [Ayatsugu_Otowa - Chouetsu Shite Shimatta Kanojo to Sore o Umi Otoshita Riyuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/455306) by [-[ Dumpling ]-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2478693) (Nominator: [Ntiger](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766))

A nice set by Dumpling featuring many additional mappers, with Julie, chaica and Senritsu covering most lower difficulties (including the very rare "Beginner" difficulty) and TKS mapping the very nice Inner Oni. While all difficulties are good, I wanna focus on that one, as it will be the most played one! TKS' Inner Oni has a lot of nice things: Very well-mapped off-beat patterns (which means starting on blue ticks in the editor, so shifted by 1/4 in osu! terms) together with 1/6 bursts and the very rare (nowadays slightly more common) 1/8 triplets! These offer an extra challenge for this map, as not many players are used to them. The map ends with a great streamy kiai, the climax and hardest part of the whole map! You are not prepared.

- [DystopiaGround - AugoEidEs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/508901) by [Nardoxyribonucleic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/876419) (Nominator: [Arrival](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1694000))

An other AugoEidEs map, yet another gameplay! This map manages to provide an other view of the song while keeping a good flow, consistency and hitsounding. The stream part is flawless, and the kiais have their own identity in comparison to the rest of the map. Overall a very solid map, couldn't expect less from Nardo and qoot!

- [Kayano Ai, Nakahara Mai, Toyosaki Aki - May I Help You?](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/103879) by [thzz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1614839) (Nominator: [DakeDekaane](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1425253))

Nice structure, check; overall consistency, check; traditional beatmapping, check; catchy song, check. This is what you can find in this beatmap, and you can't really ask for anything else, as the union of these elements makes this map really enjoyable. The consistent play with 1/4 doubles, quads, offbeat notes and big notes present in this map are delicious to play.

- [PENGUIN RESEARCH - Button](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/477685) by [Volta](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4154071) (Nominator: [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128))

I find this beatmap to be very appealing due to its overall consistent structure through both difficulties. The patterns follow the songs beat in a fair way and give at the same time enough room for own ideas, like for example the stanza-wise correct placed dkd in Oni. Overall a calm and well working beatmap which in my opinion deserves to be mentioned in the charts.

- [Chiyoko - Baby Fantastic!(Epsilon Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/496210) by [Charlotte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3686901) (Nominator: [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128))

It seems like I found my inner lolicon in me as I'm somehow found of this song. But beside that, I think this beatmap offers a good disparity between harder and easier, but also denser and less denser patterns which makes the beatmap feel more lively. One may argue about certain 1/6, but for me it was enough to enter current charts as they seem to be easy to comprehent on such low BPM.

### osu!catch

- **[F-777 - Airborne Robots](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/419373) by [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508)** (Nominator: [Chara](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284))

For this month's top pick, we have a fast-paced song for the adrenaline-pumped players! The map contains patterns not commonly found in most osu!catch mapsets now and then (you wouldn't expect a lot of 1/6 jumps in an Overdose). The Hyperdimension Flying Object difficulty features patterns that require a lot of pacing around with the catcher - and this is what makes it a fun difficulty. The map is also quite challenging, even for the lower difficulties (as of this writing, the Rain's leaderboard still has some non-full combo scores!). Overall, the map is very solid structurally and is very fun to play. Prepare to dash around as to not experience a meltdown!

- [goreshit - there are no angels here.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/514938) by [viptwo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/838877) (Nominator: [Chara](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284))

...but there is definitely a fun convert map here! The song is quite the dark one, but the map still has some fun stream patterns with a handful of 1/2 dashes. But don't let your guard down - there are some parts that might just make you miss if you're not focused! Difficulty-wise, it's catered to most of the playerbase as it's neither too easy nor too hard. This makes it accessible to most players, and also gives opportunities for players who use difficulty modifiers like Hidden or DoubleTime (yes it is doable). All of these make it a chart-worthy map. If you need an angel, you might not find it here - but you would definitely find something else!

- [Shiokara-zu - Shiokara-Bushi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/333960) by [ZiRoX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/200768) (Nominator: [Deif](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/318565))

This well-designed spread also deserves to be in the charts this month. It took a while until it got ranked but it was worth the wait to see more high-quality difficulties ranked from some of our most involved community members. Due to its calm pace the bravest players can also try getting a higher score adding some difficulty mods like Hardrock or DoubleTime to spice the last difficulty up.

- [senya - Iro wa Nioedo Chirinuru o(OPver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/420659) by [- Magic Girl -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3095784) (Nominator: [Chara](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284))

For the next pick, we look at the more serene side of things. This set features patterns that compliment the song's peacefully strong tone (talk about an oxymoron) - flowy patterns which are able to accomplish this. It is also a slow-paced map, and this makes it good for most osu!catch players on the lower end. Take a journey through one's kaleidoscopic memories with this map!

- [An - Saigo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/517783) by [Rumia-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1787171) (Nominator: [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508))

This map was recently featured in the mappool for the osu!standard World Cup, and I was impressed to discover it makes a damn good convert. Whilst the lower difficulties are built around some interesting slider shapes and direction changes, the higher difficulties gradually begin to turn up the intensity, throwing in streams, alternating wiggle patterns, and tricky dashes. As a whole, I love how the mapper created a great contrast between the calm and intense parts of the song whilst still ensuring the difficulties are interesting and enjoyable to play throughout. The difficulty spread is also well balanced, allowing everyone to enjoy this strange, yet captivating song.

- [CLIFF EDGE - Sayonara I Love You feat. jyA-Me](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/493754) by [CLSW](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/531253) (Nominator: [Chara](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284))

For those of you who loved CLSW's Endless Tears mapset and wanted some sort of a sequel, then here it is! This single-difficulty marathon map features low-bpm 1/4 patterns that make it harder than the usual osu!catch Rain difficulty. With the changes of flow complimenting the tone of the music, this map is quite fun and challenging for the player. The length also provides some sort of strain, and this just adds to its difficulty. Goodbyes are painful indeed.

### osu!mania

- **[DragonForce - The Warrior Inside](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/330405) by [_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750)** (Nominator: [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737))

This one hell of a map brings players into a long journey of stamina inducing glory, regardless of which key you play. The 4K difficulty features extended anchors, jumpstreams, handstreams, rolls, high speed burst sections, jacks, long note sections, and any other pattern structure you can think of. This really makes the map a sight to behold, and tests your skills to the limit. The 6K difficulty is similar to the 4K difficulty but with higher density. The hitsounds are also very well done, and accompanies the drum set sounds really well. If you think you have what it takes to beat this map, go ahead and show your inner warrior!

- [ETIA. feat.Jenga - Say A Vengeance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/136881) by [LeiN-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2162939) (Nominator: [Evening](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2193881))

A commendable effort by LeiN- to bring this back from the grave when it was ranked 2 years ago, taking another chance at the ranking system, in which has significantly changed views over the years. Say A Vengeance is an one of a kind ranked map where LeiN- uses a minijack in Black Another to emphasize a singular synth, a mapping approach in which has never really struck most people as a viable technique. The lower difficulties, I feel, are a good build-up towards the final difficulty, with rather interesting rhythms that can easily throw sight-readers off, they are worth playing through if you complex rhythms and playing for accuracy. Not only the technique is unique in a way, the map gives quite a different feeling than that of most maps that I've played. Focusing its difficulty in rougher and more rigid jack patterning, it itself is defintely worthy to become a challenging map to replay over and over for better scores.

- [Camellia - paroxysm](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/463583) by [Interlude-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6974536) (Nominator: [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737))

Anti-meta keymodes are always welcome in my book, but exceptionally done maps really brings in my attention. Interlude's map captures each moment of the music with fitting patterns that make it very enjoyable to play. A lot of the patterns are pleasing to the eye and satisfying to nail down. The slider changes used in the dubstep sections immerse players further into the music. Relatively complex long notes are also used, and some tricky jack patterns in the middle and the final chorus sections can throw players off. To top it off, there's a nice storyboard to go with the map!

- [Mr.T - athletic meet of sound toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/488683) by [Garalulu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/757783) (Nominator: [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737))

It's always nice to see maps get ranked with a non-popular pattern. Garalulu's map features an extensive usage of long notes that may not necessarily be comfortable to hit, but follows the music appropriately. Mapping the calm parts of the music with easier patterns is the norm, but Garalulu forgoes this by adding complex LN patterns with slowjams, making these sections one of the hardest parts of the map. Don't expect to sightread through this map with a high accuracy!

- [Getty vs. DJ DiA - Grayed Out -Antifront-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/518351) by [Fresh Chicken](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3984370) (Nominator: [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737))

I'm very happy with the maps that Fresh Chicken has been pushing for rank recently, because of how dynamic his mapping style has become. The easier difficulties are beginner friendly and don't have many tricky patterns. The note density starts to ramp up quickly from Hyper difficulty, but the patterns are still very comfortable to hit. However, his Another difficulty is on "another" level (heh see what I did there aaa) with the usage of jacks, long note patterns, and anchors. The slider velocity usage is phenomenal; not overdone but tricky enough for replayability. Great job!

- [Noah - Celestial stinger](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/491959) by [erlinadewi-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3655315) (Nominator: [-Kamikaze-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783))

da whooshiaq strikes again! This time with a very fast (259 BPM!) song from Noah. This set is really nicely structured starting from the basics and going up to a 5,4* difficulty, which despite the song being fast, manages to be pretty comfortable to play. The set is a great combination of speed and friendly patterning that's not boring in any case.

**The November 2016 ranking charts will end on the 15th January 2017.**
