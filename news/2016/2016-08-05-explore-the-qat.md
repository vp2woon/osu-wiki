Hello everyone!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/theqatgazette.jpg)

Recently, we heard voices urging from the community calling for transparent release of information about the Quality Assurance Team. Responding to your curiosity, this blog is here to deliver the progress of things we are working on and reveal (fun) facts for you!

**[Changes to the Quality Assurance Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/447417) make the QAT one of the most mysterious teams again**! After the implementation of the changes, many of you may be unsure what the QAT actually does apart from checking reports and metadata on qualified beatmaps. As the very first entry, let me introduce the working field assigned to each of us!

The group consists of **4 sub-teams** in total, being responsible for metadata checking, the Ranking Criteria Council, monthly ranking charts and Beatmap Nominator test creation. Members of each team are shown below:

- **Beatmap Nominator Tests**:
  - osu!: Irreversible, Mao
  - osu!taiko: DakeDekaane, MMzz
  - osu!catch: Deif, JBHyperion
  - osu!mania: Blocko, Feerum
- **Metadata & Reports**: alacat, Fycho, IamKwaN
- **Ranking Charts**: Kurokami, OnosakiHito, Tari
- **Ranking Criteria**: Desperate-kun, Okorin

Surprisingly, some of us started to be responsible for making up the BN test exam paper not long ago. Huge efforts are needed to brainstorm questions to examine the significant people for the mapping community in the future. Much appreciated their works!

**After a long hiatus, the [Ranking Criteria Council](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/480331) has been reformed**. The aim remains to is revise the ranking criteria for the modern game, and progress of proposals will be publicly visible as soon as they are ready. As mentioned by Desperate-kun the standard-specific council is currently revising difficulty-specific rules and guidelines. The mania-specific draft seems to be taking form as well and the taiko council will have some fresh air with OnosakiHito focusing more on charts and letting Raiden organise the Taiko rewording on his own. If you have something to contribute, do not hesitate to contact them or any of their council members!

**Final revisions are being made to the new [Code of Conduct](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/447557) for mapping and modding**. This guide aims to outline the key skills and qualities necessary for ensuring a productive and enjoyable community, from the basics of how to write a mod post, to dealing with constructive criticism and importantly, how to handle qualified maps. This should be of interest to anyone involved in the mapping and modding community, so if you have suggestions for change or improvement, head on over and make yourself heard!

Keep an eye on the blog! More refreshing information and topic are going to be released in the near future. If you have anything want to know about the QAT, please submit your question or comment below!
