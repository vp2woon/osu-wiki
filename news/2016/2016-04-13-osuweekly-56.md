For the first time this month, [flyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/flyte) has a new design drop for us! An unlikely contender has made its way through to the winners' finals of the osu!Taiko World Cup, and a long-awaited modding update has finally made its way into live testing. If that wasn't enough to satisfy your thirst for details, you're just going to have to read on for more!

**The long-awaited "Modding V2" is [finally in public testing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/442285)!** While the previous iteration made for the current website has long been unveiled, the entire system has been rebuilt for the sleek and modern [new.ppy.sh](https://osu.ppy.sh/home). We have some maps for modders to try it out first hand, so if you want to take part in some osu! history, head on over and check it out!

**Flyte has given us a [new design drop](https://next.ppy.sh/post/142451787093/its-friday-dropping-some-blurry-shots-of-my)!** We haven't had one in a rather long time considering how frequent they used to be, but this one seems rather exciting! It appears to be a couple of snaps at the different aspects of the new replay viewing interface, as well as the spectator's interface that comes with it. In my personal opinion, this new design gives the entire spectating and replay experience more of a professional and exciting feeling!

**The 8th OCWT (osu! China Winter Tournament) is coming your way!** Despite how nicely named it is, it is important to note that this tournament is neither exclusive to Chinese players nor does it take place during the winter. That's right, this is an open tournament, and quite a large one at that! If you think you and your group of friends have what it takes to take home the grand prize of a supporter tag and a neat profile badge, [you should head over and sign up soon](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/441254). The deadline is on the 14th of May!

**Registration for the [osu!catch World Cup 2016](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Osu!catch_World_Cup_2016) is [now underway](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-04-12-osucatch-world-cup-2016-registrations-open)!** With registration for the osu!Taiko World Cup 2016 turning out as a great success using the new system, it looks like the process is now pretty standardized and set for the 2016 tournament year. Anyone ranked above 5000 globally has the ability to sign-up for their country's team, so sign up before the *30th of April* to get a chance at representing your country!

It hadn't occurred to me until now, but we are now well over into a year of the osu!weekly! It's slightly unceremonious to mention something like this so late, but I wanted to thank you all for your support of this newsletter up to now. On another note, [this month's poll](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/5034069) is still running strong. Over 800 of you guys wrote down your vote already, but keep those responses coming in!

If you have any news you would like to share with us, including tournaments you are running and cool things you see other people doing, please send us an email at **[news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh)**! I really would like to show off as many things as possible, so if you could help it would be doing me a great service!
