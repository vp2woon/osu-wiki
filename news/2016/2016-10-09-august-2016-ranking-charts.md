The Ranking Charts for August 2016 have been just released and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart/?ch=MONTH1608)! As we are still searching for more volunteers to help out with preparing future monthly ranking charts, their appearance has to wait for just a little longer. Stay tuned!

## Ranking Charts Creation

The charts have [previously](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-09-17-july-2016-ranking-charts-changes) been created by letting the Quality Assurance Team select the most noteworthy maps of this month. We also reward the top beatmap in each category by providing **1 month of supporter status** to the mapper.

### osu!

- **[orangentle / Yu_Asahina - HAELEQUIN (Extended ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/272333) by [RLC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1047883)** (Nominator: [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087))

An amazing showcase of mapping skill by none other than RLC. Despite the intricacies of the song, he manages to capture each and every one of them beautifully. A fine assortment of patterns that rightfully deserves the top spot of this month's charts.

- [DJ TOTTO & Qrispy Joybox - Curtain Call Memories](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/414940) by [StarForYou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2045914) (Nominator: [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087))

A clean and refined style constructed by Regou and StarForYou. Despite being a collaboration, the whole set feels as one with both mappers complimenting each other well. From the Basic difficulty all the way to Regou's Extra, we can observe a gradual increase in difficulty that employs a polished organizational style. A great mapset that stands strong in this month's charts.

- [Hana - Sakura no Uta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/440068) by [Ultimate Madoka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1244312) (Nominator: [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087))

Solo full version sets are rare in itself nowadays, but seeing them mapped with an overarching theme in mind is a great thing to behold. Ultimate Madoka's style, while unconventional, is a breath of fresh air, and deserving of a place in this month's charts.

- [sakuzyo - Altale](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/228815) by [toybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2848604) (Nominator: [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087))

Both Bonzi's and byfar's difficulties compliment the song beautifully, without feeling overdone at all. The lower difficulties done by toybot do not disappoint as well, with fluid slider usage that stay true to the song's calming nature. A beautiful mapset deserving of a spot in this month's charts.

- [onoken - Viden](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/375402) by [-kevincela-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/266596) (Nominator: [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418))

It's sometimes a struggle to express a song with so many distinct sounds, but the difficulties of this mapset manage to express every nuance in the song perfectly. Without question, this is one of the best stream-focused maps of the month.

- [gya9 - Midnight Riders (kamome sano remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/473364) by [ProfessionalBox](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3250792) (Nominator: [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087))

ProfessionalBox brings out much of the song's intensity with a modern mapping style. Masterfully executed slider patterns, smooth streams and fluid jumps give this map a solid spot in this month's charts.

### osu!taiko

- **[Demetori - Kuuchuu ni Shizumu Kishinjou ~ Counter-Clock World](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/464535) by [Surono](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3611370)** (Nominator: [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766))

A very fun map by a mapper who hasn't really ranked much except for seals and ~boy next door~! The map features a high amount of 1/4 triplets that are mapped in a very structured way, but also with a lot of variety! Additional to all those 1/4 triplets there are longer patterns starting on rather uncommon patterns (kkkddd) and, shortly after the middle of the map has passed, a long section with several streams that are all very well mapped. Together with quite a few 1/6 quads outside of the kiai parts, two short 1/3 sections and a few carefully placed SV changes to highlight pace changes in the song this makes one awesome map that uses everything the song has to offer!

- [AAAA Chazuke - Hop Step Adventure*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/466471) by [TKS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/940878) (Nominator: [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766))

This very excellent set, brought to you by TKS, features well-mapped, structured lower difficulties and of course the highlight of the set, the Special* difficulty. But first, let me start with the general stuff which already is amazingly well done! Of course I'm talking about volume changes which, in this amount, are quite uncommon. Here they are very well done, adding additional emphasis to specific loud or quiet parts of the song (sometimes even less than a second!). Adding to this there are several equally short-lasting SV changes that add additional emphasis (and make the end more interesting to play). The Special difficulty features 1/6 quads/7-plets and 1/8 doublets that are used very consistently and in a way that is fun to play while not being overly easy, as they are also connected to 1/4 streams that are mapped in a great way. And while some might dislike this map simply because it is "pp", it feels very rewarding when you finally manage to fc the map, which means NOT getting random misses on the rather tricky 1/4+kddkddk 1/6 patterns and the pre-kiai stream.

- [TOMOSUKE x Jazzin'park - LANA - Kiroku no Kakera (sasakure.UK Framework Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/871725) by [tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767) and [SKSalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3280542) (Nominator: [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766))

SKSalt and tasuke912 bring you this fast and fun map! Both Oni and Inner Oni feature a very high density while following the song very well and being fun to play. Muzukashii also has more 1/4 than some other Muzukashiis ranked these days, offering a challenge at 200 BPM.
The song is short and sweet and likewise I don't have much to say much about these maps too except that they are very well-mapped and deserve to be on the charts!

- [LeaF - Paraclete](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/455109) by [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766) (Nominator: [S a n d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/676578))

Nwolf has done a great job at breaking down long streams of piano into enjoyable short streams. Not merely are they enjoyable, they also further emphasizes the sounds in the end of the stream. On top of that, Nwolf also has a great use of 1/2 combining with finishers acting both as a sound emphasize, and a break from the streams.
The map has varied patterns ranging from normal 1/4 triplet or pentaplet, with the addition of doublets, quadruplet, and even some challenging 1/6's. Right before the second kiai section begins, in the end of the first kiai section, in order to avoid using finishers in the stream, Nwolf has replaced it with kkkdk motifs that repeats upon every symbal clash which the way he emphasized the stream was both perfect and avoided breaking the rule of no finishers between 1/4 streams. Overall, this is another very well structured map in terms of both color arrangements and pattern arrangements.

- [SOUND HOLIC Vs. dj TAKA feat. YURiCa - TIEFSEE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/457878) by [Nardoxyribonucleic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/876419) (Nominator: [S a n d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/676578))

A very challenging map with complex 1/4 pattern alongside with 1/6. The intro has a great blend between piano sound and the vocal sound. A very strong and well constructed structure overall, . Exceedingly beneficial for players whom are looking for pattern practice as it has quite a low BPM of 165. For high end players that plays DT, this map is great for stamina practice and reading challenging patterns at a high BPM.

- [Chata - Nocte of desperatio](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/432401) by [Volta](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4154071) (Nominator: [DakeDekaane](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1425253))

You know a beatmap it's good when the feeling you got from playing it gets ingrained in you for a long time, and it's the case with this map. Despite its simple looks, the way the map is built is an invitation to have a really fun time, as it's well structured and follows the song nicely, two crucial things we can ask from a beatmap. All this combined with a soothing yet powerful song awaits for you, be sure you don't miss any of those drumroll bonus points!

### osu!catch

- **[Sengoku Nadeko (CV:Hanazawa Kana) - Mousou Express](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/228539) by [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598)** (Nominator: [Chara](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284))

A nearly full-spread map of fairly average length by Spectator, perfect for players of different skill levels. The usage of low circle size makes this quite the interesting map, and the map focuses mainly on low-bpm 1/4 patterns and jumps. It's also noteworthy that the Rain and Overdose each showcase different mapping styles from different mappers, which gives the map diversity in this aspect. The map has lots of fun patterns and dashes that could make you wanna dash around your room!

- [sakuzyo - Altale](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/228815) by [toybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2848604) (Nominator: [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508))

alienflybot is well known for his high-quality Rain difficulties, but in this map he has truly outdone himself. Each section of the map is in perfect harmony with the song, from delicate short taps to seamlessly flowing streams, each and every object and transition justifies its placement and execution. The level of difficulty is very fitting, posing a fun challenge without feeling to be lacking or overdone at any point, and the usage of AR8.8 provides a final, interesting quirk. In my opinion, this is an excellent example of what a great Rain difficulty should be.

- [Cocoa, Chino, Rize, Chiya, Syaro, Maya, Megu - Honjitsu wa Makoto ni Rarirurein](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/465206) by [Momochikun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2032824) (Nominator: [Kurokami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/260933))

This set provides a nice learing curve although a slightly easier one than the osu!catch specific ones. The two easier difficulty is good for the speed along with the Hard which has some well placed jump. Starting from Insane the level goes up and requires better control and reflex which could be a good challenge for those who can't play specific ones yet. All in all, the jumps are surprisingly well placed and I really enjoyed this mapset. I hope you guys will do that too.

- [Maon Kurosaki feat.TRUSTRICK - DEAD OR LIE &lt;tv size>](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/481696) by [Chaoslitz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3621552) (Nominator: [Deif](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/318565))

Interesting Rain difficulty by examination, quite entertaining and fun to play. It offers a nice extra challenge if HR is applied. There is not much more to say from my side.

- [Yousei Teikoku - Torikago](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/412140) by [Okorin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405) (Nominator: [Zak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375955))

This set is quite a refreshing surprise to see as most maps these days that are over 5 minutes are a single difficulty that is Insane or higher, but here we have a full Easy-Extra spread so that players of all skill levels will have something to play, and without any of them feeling too boring or over the top. Good job, Okorin!

- [Venetian Snares - She Runs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/319890) by [fergas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3144542) (Nominator: [Zak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375955))

Here's a map from fergas who's already known for mapping a couple other great Venetian Snares tracks, and this one is no exception! With fast and dense streams you'll see your combo climbing fast but there's many tricky patterns to keep you on your toes all the way through. I found this to be one of the more enjoyable marathon difficulties hitting the ranked section lately, and hope to see others enjoy it as well.

### osu!mania

- **[xi - Double Helix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/398197) by [Level 51](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3617847)** (Nominator: [Evening](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2193881))

I nominated this beatmap because of the details put into it, and how each pattern in the map fits suitably with the music. There are rarely fodder notes that fall into the pits of "I mapped this randomly" unlike what I feel about most other 7K maps (but to be fair, the music is rather supportive in terms of giving mappers content to map). That's why I felt that this map is deserving to be nominated.

- [Mastermind(xi+nora2r) - Dreadnought](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/400351) by [Kyousuke-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2616570) (Nominator: [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717))

I especially like that this map has a 4K and 7K difficulty. More variety in one mapset! Actually that's all I have to say.

- [Nightmare - Boulafacet](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/254581) by [MasterSonic10](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1249224) (Nominator: [Evening](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2193881))

With the map utilizing such an unorthodox and adventurous mapping style, it is rare to come across these kind of maps as they are usually frowned upon due to low playability and such. But with today's player base, it is definitely a suitable one of a kind map that sharpshooters can enjoy without it being too ridiculously difficult for anyone to play. I'm nominating this because of how rare we come across these type of maps, even in pending. These patterning though harsh, works well as the mapper is able to maintain a suitable difficulty gradient/curve and is able to keep the spread reasonable for players to play. Furthermore, the song itself is rather tricky to map, quite impressed on how it turned out despite the song being rather chaotic in nature

- [Wix Games - Glacier Theme](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/371114) by [Modren](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1828621) (Nominator: [-Kamikaze-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783))

An ideal mapset for people who are looking to pick up 9K as a new challenge on their road in osu!mania. A calm and nice ambient accompanied by this really nicely thought out chart for both newcomers and people who are starting to get adept at this keymode. Easy difficulty features pretty basic pitch relevant patterns and Normal introduces rather tricky LN patterns that are a decent challenge to hit, even at that low of a BPM. A short and well done chart.

- [AKITO - Sakura Kagetsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/472124) by [ZZHBOY](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1565739) (Nominator: [[ A v a l o n ]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4632359))

I especially love the patterns how they flow. Even though people judge it as an easy beatmap, it still felt very good when I've played it because of the well made keysounds which sound beautiful to me.

- [Rche - entelecheia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/476394) by [Starry-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2166199) (Nominator: [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717))

Pretty challenging beatmap, especially the highest difficulty. Very dense jumpstream and high OD require pretty accurate play. Also pretty stamina draining.

**The August 2016 ranking charts will end on the 30th October 2016.**
