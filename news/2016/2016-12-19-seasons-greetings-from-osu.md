Christmas is soon upon us, and even if you don't celebrate, there's sure to be a holiday of some fashion or another slated for you in the coming week! We've got a few presents tucked away for you, so come find out what they are!

The very first present is a Christmas-themed makeover for the main-menu screen. For the duration of Christmas and up until just before the dawn of 2017, we'll be showcasing a hand-picked assortment of some of our personal favourites from the [Christmas Fanart Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/36), featuring the works of some **incredibly** talented artists.

Curious? Go see them all at the [voting page](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/36) and give your favourite **three** pieces your votes. The top three winning entries will receive 6 months, 3 months and 2 months of osu!supporter respectively.

Unfortunately, giving out only three votes is going to be *exceptionally* difficult, because there are so many absolutely amazing entries. Wow. Just wow.

On top of this, [cYsmix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/2) has yet again outdone himself and produced a beautiful festive intro track for the occasion, which you can hear by opening the game, or by listening below:

The Charts crew also have a **HUGE** Christmas themed chart on the cards, so large in fact that it'll be getting its own post announcing its release, along with some swanky new prizes to boot! Keep your eyes peeled!

We'd just like to take a moment to thank everyone for playing and enjoying osu! this year - while 2016 is quickly coming to a close, it's been a superb year for the game, and we're super excited to see what 2017 will bring.

We hope you have a most happy holiday - and we'll see you on New Years for yet another surprise! Whatever could it be?
