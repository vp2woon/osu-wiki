Hello everyone, Evrien here, assigned with the task of informing you the final results of osu! World Cup 2016. Spanning across 6 exciting and hype-filled weekends, the OWC 2016 saw 32 teams representing player communities around the world. Needless to say, the excitement was almost tangible in the air, and this winter was set ablaze by the passion and support from everyone involved.

Without further ado, here are the Top 3 Teams of OWC 2016.

**Taking 3rd place, the South Korean team showcased great tenacity and well-roundedness.** Team Captain Neta is an experienced veteran from both official and community tournaments, and under his lead the South Korean players strived for the very top. Having climbed to \#1 earlier this year, Angelsim was instrumental alongside My Aim Sucks, carrying the team forward and avoiding several close losses. While they may have lost their star Hidden player Cinia Pacifica early in the tournament, South Korea bonded closely together as – T A R U L A S - , La Valse, Enon, and Yuria did their very best keeping the team afloat all the way to Winner's Finals. Shouldering great responsibility of bringing the champion title back to Asia, the South Koreans faced considerable pressure, but their performance was nothing to be scoffed at, and momentum dictates that they will continue to be a great powerhouse in the osu! competitive scene.

**Team China will proudly occupy the 2nd place.** Despite being one of the lower-ranked teams in the Top Seed, the Chinese players closed up the gap thru sharpening their overall skills and technical expertise. Captain Crystal comes from the osu!Catch community, bringing with him the knowledge that was used to take that osu!Catch champion title. He was assisted by former captain MatsumotoRise, and together developed strategies that guarded Team China in the Loser's Bracket of the first Finals Weekend. Totori, formerly known as Rustbell, fully showcased why he was called the "Sprobot" by becoming the absolute nightmare of a great many teams that were knocked down by China. Dsan, alongside veteran player GGBY, provided the backup needed for China on multiple occasions thru their experienced knowledge of the maps and the game. SpringLane, ArtxE, and Totoki (Tokichii) – the "High BPM Trio" – gave Team China quite the edge on Double Time picks. Together, these players fought back Team USA on the first set this weekend in flying colors. While they may have saw their better when their best was not enough, these Oriental knights have earned the respect of every single team they came across. Surely enough, nobody will forget the amazing run they had this year.

**Last but most certainly not the least, Team USA is once again our champion team of OWC this year!** Widely celebrated and well-reviewed, the American players have an almost impregnable wall of iron defense built brick-by-brick from their solid skillsets. Captain "Our Boy" \[Toy\] demonstrated great improvements since his performance last year. Despite being away in Japan and having to use an unfamiliar setup, he quickly adjusted, and alongside Team USA's new blood carry ihd kee (\[Toy\]s our boy) fought back the Chinese hurricane in the second Grand Finals set. HappyStick, formerly serving Team Netherlands, provided great support for his new country on Hardrock and Double Time fronts. fieryrage, mniminwoo, and Mlaw22, all new to the OWC scene, maintained firm footing on the ground of a shaky Finals mappool, steadily supporting their teammates. The "No Mod Champ" Ritzeh and Axarious, with their solid knowledge and experience from previous tournaments, paved a path with their team leading to victory. Especially noteworthy was how the American players adjusted themselves between the 2 sets, within 10 minutes of break time, and quickly formulated a strategy that they direly need for several close and tightly-contested wins over China. They have shown their credentials as top players and the undebatable champions, and their performance do their title justice.

**Finally, as we close off this year's last major event, I would like to take this chance to thank the players who fought bravely for their country's glory.** Each and every one of the participating players of OWC has reasons to be proud of their performance. I would also like to thank the staff working tirelessly behind the scenes, for without their energy and sacrifices this tournament would not come together. And of course, thank *you* for keeping up and supporting your favorite players. OWC 2016 was a success only thanks to the entire community coming together as one, and we hope this ride has been enjoyable.

So what do you say? See you next year? You bet, it's a promise then!
