Do you ever get the feeling the game changes whenever you're not looking at it? I know, spooky right? Thankfully, the osu!weekly has been keeping track of the position of everything on your desk. Want to know where that ghost took your tablet pen? Read on to find out!

**A big thanks to the following contributors for making this *haunting* edition of osu!weekly possible:**<br>
[Count Raveille](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Raveille), [Xylostein](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Xylo-), [He Who Beats The Dead](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/deadbeat), [and an intractably handsome unnamed spirit with a strange fixation on chips](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Ephemeral)

**You know what's more spooky than the rate of which the game updates? The fact that Ephemeral already made [a post](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-10-29-halloween-cometh) about it!** cYsmix (one of the resident osu!musicians) released a banging new track that will be *mysteriously* replacing our beloved circles theme from nekodex. Other new content such as new paranormal "hush-hush" achievements are also waiting for you to stumble upon when you least expect it!

**deadbeat put together a new storyboard showcase on the newly loved "Stuff - Spooky Scary Skrillitons" made by Charles445.** Couldn't let the others have all the fun! How the heck did he manage to pull that one off between Ephemeral's post and mine? Now THAT's spooky. We upload showcases and other fun videos on our youtube channel regularly, so be sure to check it out if you're interested in seeing cool content from around the community!

**Our first [returning community poll](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/508531/start=15) has come to an end!** For the month of October, we asked you guys what you have tried to use in the past as a tool to play the game with. Some of the interesting answers include a home built arcade style mania cabinet (which the poster has yet to deliver me pictures of), and [using a scanner with the mildly dated android port](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zijUbm4kEZY). Unsurprisingly, the majority of players stick to the comfort of playing with a tablet or mouse, but there is definitely a large amount of people who enjoy trying different things!

**In light of the addition of the "loved" category of beatmaps, we had a series of polls asking for what you want to see added to the category!** These choices went in with the Halloween Update and cover a huge spread of maps from the Community Voice polls. [Check them out here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved)

**Now for this week's most numerically inclined section - the weekly scorewatch!** Who doesn't love to be swarmed in some good ol' scores and achievements? Let's jump right in.

Earlier in October, [RAMPAGE88](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/448547), a Saudi Arabian osu!catch player, set a record for having the highest ranked score in all modes, with 200,000,000,000. osu!catch has been setting many records, with the highest pp play also in osu!catch. I'll wait for someone to hit 250,000,000,000. That's a *lot* of zeroes.

Fancy some taiko action? [\_yu68](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/_yu68) FCed [DragonForce - Heroes Of Our Time](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/461782) on DT (99.52%), gaining 586pp. This was an 8.44* FC as well, making it all the more impressive.

<p style="text-align:center;"><i>More like the Horrors of Our Time. Do people even have fingers left after >8 star plays?</i></p>

Step aside Rafis and hvick225, [Gayzmcgee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1419095) has stolen No.1 on [FLOWxGRANRODEO - 7 -seven-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/282345) with an impressive HDDT SS, supplying him a tasty 564pp score.

![](https://osu.ppy.sh/ss/6435665)
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>The only way this could've been more satisfying is if it were 565pp, or had a seven in it somehow.</i></p>

[Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689) is USA's boy indeed! He not only managed to SS [Our Stolen Theory - United (L.A.O.S Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/237768), granting him 521pp, but also FCed [Yooh - Ice Angel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/297933) with an HDHR 98.90% score giving him 575pp. He will also participate in the World Cup this year again, so watch out for this man!

![](https://osu.ppy.sh/ss/6435682)
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Infinitely spooky indeed.</i></p>

Remember the rarity of 700pp plays? No? Me neither! [Vaxei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4787150) and [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) went on to set respective 700pp plays; the former setting a HDDT 98.73% Rank 1 FC score on [Aquors - Aozora Jumping Heart \[hvick225's Extra\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1063410?m=0) granting him 711pp, the latter setting a HDDTHR 99.25% Rank 1 FC score on [Ayase Rie - Yuima-ru*World TVver. \[Extra\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/983680?m=0), giving him 713pp.

Now how's that for some *bone rattling* news? If you have any suggestions for content you'd like to see in next week's issue, be sure to check out our osu!dev discord and drop by the weekly channel! I'm around (most of the time) if you highlight me, and deadbeat is very reliably around to help you. The osu!news team wishes you a safe and happy halloween!

Remember to brush your teeth as well. The spirits might leave after Halloween is over, but cavities tend to remain and they hurt. A lot.

If you'll excuse me, I also really need to find out where that tablet pen went.

Also come to think of it, where did issue \#77 go?

...**TOO SPOOKY**
