It's been a long while since our last monthly contest, but we're back with a brand new challenge, featuring the winner of the [first osu!remix contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/1), [BilliumMoto](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3862471) and his track *HDHR*!

We'll be continuing the MBC series across other gamemodes (including osu!, of course) in 2017. To end 2016 on a high note and celebrate the OWC finals, we figure we'd give the creative side of the game the means to flex their muscles in a more competitive environment as well.

Here's a taste of the track for this contest:

## What are the prizes?

- 6 months of osu!supporter (for yourself, a friend, or many friends - the choice is yours)
- The highly coveted *Elite Mapper* forum title and entry into the osu! Hall of Fame
- The winning map will be featured by the official osu! media team, including a video preview, and potentially much more!

## What are the rules?

- **All maps submitted must be for the osu! gamemode.** Other contests for other gamemodes will appear later in 2017.
- **All submitted difficulties must adhere to the Ranking Criteria as closely as possible.** Small mistakes and issues that can be fixed post-contest will not be judged too harshly. This isn't an Aspire contest!
- You must map at least **three** (3) difficulties in an appropriate spread as per the Ranking Criteria, either ENH (easy, normal and hard) or NHI (normal, hard, insane).
- You may map **one** (1) expert level difficulty for your set if you are mapping an NHI spread, for an end spread of NHIE. *You are not REQUIRED to create an expert level difficulty for your set if you do not want to.*
- No more than **four** (4) difficulties may be submitted under any circumstances.
- Collaboration is allowed, but only the submitter of the set will receive credit for the prizes.
- Difficulty names **must only be the name of the respective difficulty**. Things like 'Monstrata's spicy triangles' or 'pishifat's Expert' are not allowed.
- Maps and sets submitted to the contest must not be uploaded to the BSS until the contest has concluded and the winners have been announced.

Like all other MBC's, a panel of hand-picked judges from the Beatmap Nominators and the Quality Assurance Team will determine the winner after extensive deliberation. Entries will be judged on their worth and cohesion as a full set, not just as individual difficulties, as per every other MBC.

The contest will be open for a full month. Consult the countdown on the contest listing page if you are uncertain - we will **NOT** be accepting any late entries. No excuses anymore!

Good luck, you'll need it.
