## Weekly news

**The [osu!store](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/listing) has closed its doors for the holiday season!** Besides getting your name changed and perhaps gazing yonder at what could have been a osu!merchandise filled stocking, there's nothing left to be done at our lovely storefront until perhaps the new years. However, we all know that the new years is normally time for new products to roll around! Last year, we introduced the new osu!hoodies and the new osu!go storage drives. Stay tuned for more news on this!

**The osu!World Cup stream experience wouldn't have been complete without the help of our handsome and charming casting team.** But wait, you might say, I can do better than that! We want to give you that benefit of the doubt, so registration for osu!mania 7K World Cup commentators has begun! Think you have a voice talent that we haven't discovered yet? Passionate about keyboard mashing? Head over to the i[nformation post Loctav put together](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/419937), and give it your best!

**If you're a member of our BN team, this is your [last chance](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/5688123) to sign up as a MBC judge!** We've been dying to know what new tracks our featured artists have been holding up their sleeves for us, and we might finally get to hear another one soon. Our osu! music initiative has made progress by leaps and bounds in the past year. Curious to see who's been joining our cause? Take a look at our latest featured artist, [Loki/Thaehan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/70), over at his page!

**What the heck happened to the client this time?** It looks like some of that snow you shoveled off your driveway this morning is making its way into our beloved game. However, much like how you'd gather around the window for the first snow of the year, it doesn't feel very cold when you're inside and looking at it through a sheet of glass! Cycling through the background are submissions from this year's holiday fanart contest, and rocking out around the christmas cookie is a new fabulous release from none other than cYsmix himself! For a full list of changes and events happening for the festive rhythm gaming season, head on over to the news post that [Ephemeral whipped up for us](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-12-19-seasons-greetings-from-osu).

<p style="text-align:center;">Really, the submissions this year are amazing.</i></p>

**Just a reminder to all you people who need to get maps ranked for Christmas, [Yuii-'s christmas modding queue](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/522827) is still in business!** I've already mentioned this before, but now that we're creeping ever close to the actual deadline, this really is your last chance to get something done.

## Scorewatch: December Week 3 (with [Raveille](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1388767))

The OWC has finally concluded, but we still have a big pool of scores awaiting us!

[Halogen-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/169992) burnt an SS into [goreshit - burn this moment into the retina of my eye](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/692640?m=3), becoming the only player to SS it thus far; the closest players to SSing the map are inteliser and Cobo-. This 5.30 star, OD10, 6:16 map gave Halogen- 385pp, and a well deserved score as well!

Our Top 100 gatekeeper has done it! Veteran mouse player [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983) broke the 500pp barrier with his 98.38% FC on [xi - Blue Zenith](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/658127m=0) and earned 505pp. This play also shot him into the 9,000 pp club and back into the Top 100. With Angelsim taking a break from osu!, Doomsday's message is still loud and clear that mouse can indeed do everything. The current Top 100 now consists of only 9,000pp players as well!

Remember [Musty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/251683)? Yeah, he's back on the scoreswatch again with an impressive HDHR 99.18% FC on [9mm Parabellum Bullet - Inferno](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1029562?m=0) on the Tortured Soul Extra difficulty and earned 629pp and securing a strong No.1 spot on the map. This play shot him up into the Top 10, becoming the second ever French to hit it. Simply outstanding.

[Amamiya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3934999), whom we covered not too long ago, set an absolutely shocking HD 99.54% FC on [Konuko - Toumei Elegy](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/219380), and yes, ON THE HARDEST DIFFICULTY, which is 7.47* without any mods. This accuracy beats out the likes of Axarious, Cookiezi, and Neliel. This play is worth 597pp, and definitely well deserved.
