In perhaps the closest voting in any of our Fan Art contests ever, the results are finally out for the amazing Christmas-themed entries!

Some [absolutely incredible entries](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/36) came in from some of our amazingly talented community artists this time - so much so that three votes simply didn't seem like enough to give credit where credit is due! Nonetheless, hundreds of people agonized over their choices and made the top three winners known:

Taking **first place** by storm, [\[ Piyori \]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4457608) awed people across the world with their incredible portrayal of a rugged-up pippi reflected in the mirror sheen of a Christmas bauble. Wow. We also featured \[ Piyori \]'s work as part of the hand-picked entries that made it to the main-menu.

In **second place**, [pyun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/981534) stole the show with their delightful rendition of a curious pippi in Christmas attire gazing curiously at the viewer with pyun's own community mascot standing beside. pyun's work was also featured on the main-menu as part of the hand-picked entries, too!
