It's been a long time coming, but our first ever set of mapping bounties have been awarded. Come see the three newest maps to be added to the game client!

Many months ago back in 2015, we opened up a new concept called "mapping bounties" to the community. To celebrate osu! licensing some of its first artists ever, we'd commemorate the pioneer mappers who took their tracks and made awesome things with them by bundling the best maps submitted with the client, and giving them a whole bunch of swag for their effort.

In particular, we were looking for maps to our (then) newest signature tracks, [Manic](https://soundcloud.com/olemlanglie/cysmix-manic-osu), [House With Legs](https://soundcloud.com/olemlanglie/cysmix-house-with-legs-osu) and [Dovregubben's Hall](https://soundcloud.com/olemlanglie/cysmix-dovregubbens-hall-new-ver-osu), all produced by our in-house artist, **cYsmix**.

We had special backgrounds commissioned and added onto each winning map - take a look at the header of this post for a little taste of their full glory!

A few mappers rose to the challenge, though surprisingly few altogether. Going forward, we'll be looking at revising the critieria surrounding map bounties and hopefully make them more accessible and lucrative for those interested in taking the plunge.

All that aside, here are the chosen maps (and their mappers) for the first bounty pool:

Manic: [monstrata's rendition](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/361175)

House With Legs: [alacat's rendition](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/360680)

Dovregubben's Hall: [Guy's rendition](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/360950)

Each of these maps will be bundled with the game client for an indeterminate period of time. [monstrata](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2706438), [alacat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/869782#osu) and [Guy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/91738) will all receive **$50 in osu!store credit, 6 months of osu!supporter, and a unique profile badge** for their effort.

*(Their profile badges may not be live at the time of posting, we're still trying to figure out a suitably awesome badge for their efforts.)*

Do note that the [second month of mapping with rewards](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/132009865043/mapping-with-rewards-oct-2015) is still technically active, as no maps fulfilling the criteria set out in that post have yet been made. If you want your chance at swag and prestige, you can still get in on it!

Keep your eyes peeled for a forthcoming announcement regarding map bounties going forward. We've got a lot planned for the concept!
