Refined elegance joins the osu! mascot lineup! Meet Maria, osu!mania's new postergirl!

Joining Pippi and Yuzu in the osu! mascot collection, Maria brings a touch of mature class to the classically older style of rhythm gaming found in osu!mania. An accomplished pianist in her own right, you'll find Maria on any osu!mania map, cheering you on as your combo builds ever higher. She also takes on the mantle of osu!'s official meganekko (or glasses girl, for the more cultured types).

To celebrate Maria's release, we've added a brand new achievement (and swanky medal) to the game. Simply score above 100 combo on any osu!mania map, convert or otherwise, and witness her in all her glory!

*(We highly recommend using the default skin so that you actually see Maria in-game, but it isn't necessary to get the achievement.)*

The more intrepid creators among us will find a few new skinning options available to them for the osu!mania mode - read all about it over at the [osu!wiki](/wiki/Skinning/skin.ini#[mania]).

With the osu!mascot roster nearly fully filled, wardrums beat in the distance as the last contender approaches. When all four are finally united, what sort of adventures will they get up to?

Only time will tell!
