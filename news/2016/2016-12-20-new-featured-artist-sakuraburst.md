Beatmaps explode across the dying horizon as the critically acclaimed experimental-electronica artist known as **sakuraburst** joins the ranks of the osu!musicians!

A forerunner among the experimental music community on Soundcloud, **sakuraburst**'s tracks have seen use in osu! by some of our most skilled mappers to create some incredible experiences. A unique fusion of glitch, melodic soundscapes, breakcore and winding, evocative synthlines, **sakuraburst**'s sound is as enigmatic as it is majestic.

Experienced mappers will find an OVERWHELMING platform to weave a beatmap around across a plethora of sounds, and newer mappers will find a substantial challenge awaiting them.

You can read more about **sakuraburst** at [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/8), which contains a detailed biography, previews of an assortment of available tracks, and pre-timed oszs to use for mapping and generally making awesome stuff.

As with all Featured Artists, all of the tracks on **sakuraburst**'s listing are totally free to be used in anything osu! related - beatmaps, storyboards, podcasts, and much, much more. If it's related to osu!, it's free for you to use without worry.

We're excited to bring on artists from a variety of musical backgrounds and genres into osu!, especially people who go above and beyond with their work.
