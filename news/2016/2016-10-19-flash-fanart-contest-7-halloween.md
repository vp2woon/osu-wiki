Halloween draws near. A time of spooks and thrills, and most of all - a new FLASH fanart contest! The winner gets to spook (or amaze, preferably amaze) osu! worldwide from the main menu and more!

Given the tremendous reception to the last fanart contest, we're excited to host another one, this time with the theme being **'the mascots in Halloween'**. To spice things up a bit, **this also includes the community-submitted mascots for the previous contests**, even the ones that didn't win. If you've forgotten them already (how could you?), head on over to the [fanart contest #6 page](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/2) and refresh your memory.

Unlike the other contest though, this one's a *flash* contest, meaning that we totally didn't get lost in organizing this [due to the hype surrounding a certain new ranking mode](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-10-17-here-comes-the-love) or anything. Instead, the contest is going to happen very quickly.

What this actually means is that from the date of this post, the contest will only be open for **7 days, until October 26 23:59:59 NYC.**

Community voting will open only hours after the entries close, and you can expect to hear a lot of goading from us to get people voting before the polls expire on the dawn of the 31st.

And just to make extra sure, **no, we don't actually mean a FLASH (as in the animation software suite) contest, but rather that this contest goes very very quickly in comparison to others that we've held.**

The winning entries will have their works used as main-menu art for the duration of Halloween. We'll be choosing two winners - a community vote, and a staff pick, and rotating both winners throughout the day.

The winners will also both receive 2 months of osu! supporter to tide them over until the end of the year.<br>

## Rules

- Artists should use the custom templates provided: [PSD template](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16332218/osu%21%20Title%20Screen%202732x1536.psd) / [PNG template](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16332218/osu%21%20Title%20Screen%202732x1536.png).
- **Note: these templates are to be used as a guide. Don't leave the pink circle in your work though, you'll just look dumb!**
- The artwork you create has to be Halloween themed. If you show up with Christmas stuff, you'll be comically wrong. Even if clowns are in season this Halloween, it still isn't going to fly.
- Submit only your own work! Don't plagiarise. This should go without saying. Don't trace other people's poses or anything either.
- Don't use copyrighted characters from other intellectual properties. You're free to use the community-submitted mascots from the last contest as references to replicate in your own work, but they still remain the creation of their original artists, so respect that!
- Entries must meet the size requirements for a main-menu piece (at least 1366x768, or higher. 2732x1536 is optimal wherever possible.)

Also, entering the contest basically entails that you agree to let us use your art on the osu! website and associated social media accounts. We'll always give credit where credit is due though, and ensure that you get the appropriate exposure you deserve for your work.
