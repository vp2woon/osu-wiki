## Scorewatch: December Week 2 (with [Raveille](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1388767))

[NerO](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1545031) managed to snipe the famous WubWoofWolf SS on [Black Hole - Pluto](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/45074), known for its frequent BPM changes ranging from 50 to 270 that make it incredibly difficult to follow the music and beat. His HDHR 97.66% FC gave him 358pp, but the play is more impressive than you think!

[SillyFangirl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2288363) surely isn't going anywhere down slow! He managed to FC the Loved [Camellia - Shun no Shifudo o Ikashita Kare Fumi Paeria](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/973452&m=3) within the first week of getting loved with a strong 99.66%. We await the first FC on the SV difficulty of the map, nonetheless, congratulations!

[blizzardice](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1756690), a touchscreen player, managed to set the next HDDT FC on [Maffalda - pensamento tipico de esquerda caviar](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/422328?m=0) with a 91.16% 580pp score. Yes, this was done on touchscreen, making this the highest touchscreen pp play and also the highest pp play in Canada. Check it out!

[Adamqs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/613592) is not just your typical Top 100 player - he managed to set the *first ever* HDHR 99.05% FC on [Camellia - LET'S JUMP](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/839711?m=0). This map is littered with 146BPM stream spacings, making an HDHR play very difficult to pull off. This play was *only* worth 446pp, but if you are willing to take out 7 minutes of your day, do take a look at this play.

## OWC Week 5, Finals Week 1: Team China Treads the Road of Revenge (with [Evrien](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/791660))

Does anyone still recall how last year's OWC ended? After being defeated by team China 6-3 in Winner Finals, the United States fell into the dreaded Loser's Bracket, and faced imminent elimination when they crossed paths with Poland. However, the Freedom Fighters grasped onto this spider's thread of hope and fought their way back to a rematch.

The two teams duked it out in an epic fashion, and team USA walked away with the title after winning the final tiebreaker: Furioso Melodia. And this year, the table has turned as team China got knocked down by team USA in semifinals, and walked their road of revenge in the Loser's Bracket this past weekend.

The United Kingdom and Taiwan opened up the weekend for the teams in Loser's Bracket. Facing an imperfect roster due to their missing star player Rucker, Taiwan nonetheless fought their bravest against this British powerhouse, but the tea-drinking gentlemen took them down 6-4.

China then met Germany, and the match was a fearsomely close contest with neither team being able to break the other until a tight until 4-4 end. However, the Chinese dragons did not falter, and took down Germany with 2 straight wins, avoiding a tiebreaker.

Then immediately following, China faced off against the United Kingdom. Having tasted their weaknesses and measured their strengths now, China seemed much more reserved and comfortable with the pool. After falling behind on the first point by only 11k points, the Chinese team went on a rampage and knocked 5 straight points out from under the United Kingdom in a shockingly decisive display of talent. The match settled in a tidy 6-2, with China earning their ticket towards a match against South Korea well and truly.

South Korea and the United States' match in the Winner's Bracket earlier ended in a dramatic comeback from the Americans. Just as the match seemed to lean heavily in favor of South Korea, the United States pulled themselves together at 2-4 by winning on a mere 10.1k on Mad Machine. Hitting their second wind, the tables rapidly turned and the United States emerged on top with a 6-4 finish.

Now, the South Koreans must overcome China in order to get a rematch against the Americans. However, China did not lose their momentum from the day before, and brought up their absolute A game against South Korea, finishing the match with a 6-2, showing that they are ready for the second chance against the United States.

What do you think? Will the United States be successful defending their title? Or will China ride the Loser's Bracket Momentum and make the comeback real? This weekend, Sunday UTC 0400, [twitch.tv/osulive](http://twitch.tv/osulive) – you would not wanna miss it!

Be there, or be square. But don't be square, because we are circles. So just be there.
