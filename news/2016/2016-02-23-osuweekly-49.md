It looks like we are getting a little breather for this time. With no running tournaments a series of things to look forward to in the coming weeks, it isn't unfair to say there's no better time to call the calm before the storm. Want to know what there is to be excited for? Read on to find out!

**Woah! What happened to the menu on cutting-edge?** It's almost as if someone gave the osu! cookie a heck of a lot of caffeine and now it just can't calm down! A lot of talk has been going on about the implementation of the designs of osu!next, and it seems that some of that has been slowly but surely making its way into the game.

<p style="text-align:center;">Party hard!</p>

**If you follow the game and its community via the realm of social media, you may have noticed that Peppy has presented [a question](https://twitter.com/ppy/status/702014483015663616) to those who have his posts appear on their feeds.** That's right, there are more things coming to the osu! store a lot sooner than we expected! The osu! hoodie will begin its initial runs soon, and what a better time than now to start following peppy now for future updates?

**You are now able to re-order sections on your profile in the preview of the new osu! website!** Thanks to an increasing amount of contributors to the [osu-web repository](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web) from the [bounty system](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jNXfj_S3Pb5PErA-czDdC9DUu4IgUbe1Lt8E7CYUJuE/edit#gid=332590607), work on the new website is now progressing faster than ever before. This particular feature was implemented marvelously by [LiquidPL](https://github.com/LiquidPL). Want to help us complete the new face of osu? Hop on over to the [issues tracker](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/issues) and take a look at what bounties you can pick up!

**A mere 8 hours after it was ranked, [Rafis achieved a whopping 99.21% full combo](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/471156/rafis_babymetal_road_of_resistance_rebellion_9921/) on [Babymetal - Road of Resistance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/399372), cashing out a 612 pp play.** While I do not expect this to be the highest rated play to last for a long time given how fast that was, it is simply too large of an achievement to be ignored. This also marks the first time [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/rafis) has achieved a 600+ pp score without using the DoubleTime mod!

<p style="text-align:center;">I'll be honest, there's something about looking at big numbers that makes it very satisfying...</p>

**[Ephemeral has given us some insight on what has been going on internally in the ranks of the osu! staff.](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/139478794378/meet-ephemeral)** In short, the actions we take going forward will become a lot more transparent in order to better communicate with the community our intentions and receive feedback.

**It seems that [-Ryosuke](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/835808) is [trying something new with his new tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/420869)!** osu! Crews employs a system that requires a lot more thought and planning in order to make the most out of a team's assets and stifle the weaknesses. If you are interested in participating, the competition is still in registration phase, so you still can get a team together in time!

A lot of people took a little break this week! Stefan and Flyte are giving their respective jobs a little bit of downtime in order to keep things fresh and interesting. However, just because they're having a leave doesn't mean you guys have to! If you see anything interesting going on around the community, be sure to send it to us over at news@ppy.sh. If you have any feedback on this edition of the weekly, don't hesitate to let me know in the comments below or on the [r/osugame thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/476iyf/osuweekly_49/).
