### osu!

- **[Linkin Park - Guilty All The Same (feat. Rakim)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/342472) by [384059043](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1343783)** (Nominator: [Okorin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405))

A symmetry-based approval length mapset, except that it is offering a difficulty for every level of player to enjoy. The style of this set is consequently pulled off in a fitting manner which makes it the most outstanding map this month in terms of dedication along with trying something a lot of other mappers would not have the patience to pull off mostly alone.

- [kamome sano - emotional](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/416949) by [Naitoshi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2730086) (Nominator: [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418))

This map builds from the ground up towards a magnitude players would never expect. It begins with widely simple rhythms for the first two minutes, along with some hints at more complexity in its design. By the first chorus, the map reaches what's expected to be the climax, but those expectations are shattered two minutes later with Naitoshi's stunning way of mapping the second chorus.

- [Nanahoshi Kangengakudan feat.Matsushita - Dance Number o Tomo ni](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/353398) by [pkk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3620525) (Nominator: [Okorin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405))

This song, or more accurately, a different version of this song is widely popular as an old and iconic mapset that sits in the approval category. pkk takes a similar approach to that difficulty and offers an entire spread for this alternating-based song pulled off in a style that showcases nostalgic elements combined with more recent techniques in order to make an outstanding mapset deserving its place in the charts.

- [Liz Triangle - Who Killed U.N.Owen](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/363033) by [rui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/74313) (Nominator: [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087))

A simple, yet enjoyable journey through a fun song. Accompanied by a fantastic storyboard by Patchouli, rui's takes on this song provides a thoroughly entertaining experience for all audiences. He employs a consistent style throughout the song, and uses technique such as coupled sliders to further bring out the various intensities of the songs. The rhythm choices and spacing usage are spot on and give the map a nice challenge without feeling overdone. Overall a very high quality map that deserves a spot in this month's charts.

- [maras k - Play Time!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/345325) by [Reol](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1945351) (Nominator: [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087))

A really well-put together set featuring quality difficulties from various guest mappers. Let's Play has solid usage of jump patterns that feature variable spacing and movement gimmicks to give a little extra oomph to the song. Asahina Byfar's Extra handles intensity very carefully, keeping it simple and eventually culminating in a explosive final kiai that features both unorthodox rhythms and high spacing that's done masterfully. Not forgetting the lower diffs, which were all very cleanly mapped and well executed. Despite the mapset being made up for 5 different mappers, it feels as if they're on the same page and gives this mapset a solid place in this month's chart.

- [PolyphonicBranch - Usotsuki Betty](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/60140) by [Chewin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/617323) (Nominator: [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087))

5 different mappers come together to produce a beautiful representation of this song. Mochi's Easy is a smooth and simple difficulty relying mostly on blankets and clean shapes while Andrea's Normal gives us a taste of old, vertical axis symmetry mapping. alacat's Hard manages to pull off the tricky rhythms in this song well while maintaining the simplicity expected from a hard difficulty. Chewin's own difficulty, Insane, showcases his characteristic curved slider style, accompanied by fluid jumps and coupled patterns. Skystar's Extra is a jaw-dropping assortment of rhythms and patterns. From symmetry to streamjumps, it has everything. Be sure to play this at least once to experience how Skystar manages to turn an awfully complex rhythm into a delightful playing experience. All in all, 5 quality difficulties from 5 quality mappers clearly deserving of a spot in this month's chart.

### osu!taiko

- **[Hate vs Brilliance - Qubism](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/451660) by [Nishizumi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2496768)** (Nominator: [S a n d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/676578))

Amazing, just amazing. The flow of the streams topped with flawless use of 1/6 in the piano section both sound well and play well. The use of controlled 1/3 along with 1/4 in the electronic section again demonstrates his capability in structure mapping. The extra 1/1 break before the piano stream section emphasized the finisher (big note) without the use of ninja note, a bonus point for that. The subtle use of speed change in the slow section before kiai is appropriate and adds an extra layer to make the map interesting. The section towards the end of the kiai has 1/6 in the end of some short streams to enhance the playing experience by giving it a "burst" which both follows the song flawlessly and plays amazingly. On top of everything I've said, it is also worth noting the attention to details he has in his maps. In the beginning and ending of the song, he has used volume change on every note in specific streams to again add more details. To criticize this map? I've got nothing. In my opinion, hands down for the best map of 2016 September.

- [MAJI - Saishuu Kichiku Zenbu Fue o Muriyari Hardcore ni Shite Mita.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/352813) by [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128) (Nominator: [Arrival](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1694000))

Another nice and fun Touhou song mapped by OnosakiHito, featuring as usual a perfect structure as well as an overall good flow that makes it enjoyable and very fun to play. The increasing density in the kiai and the use of doublets and quadruplets fits very well with the song and the taiko drum itself, and make a clear contrast with the majority of the map. But what really made me vote for this map are the slowest parts, where the SV is slow, and the abundant use of doublets that make them harder to read than you'd think at first, but still being fun to play and to watch, though I wouldn't qualify it as very a hard map. We see in the slow part a continuous increase of the SV that give a nice effect on the map in general, and make the last kiai really impactful as a player's perspective, not to mention the climax at the end, mapped with a fairly long stream, which makes a good  conclusion to this solid map, and fun song!

- [Seinabo Sey - Pistols at Dawn (Culture Shock Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/405815) by [Aldwych](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1416484) (Nominator: [Ntiger](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766))

This drum'n'bass map features very structured mapping and a high amount of drum rolls, coupled with volume and SV changes to make them sound and look great. Additionally there are several simple streams to practice your streaming skills at a fair BPM (174). Overall this is a very nice map by Aldwych, who managed to make a song that in its nature is quite repetitive feel exciting by varying the map enough to make the gameplay NOT repetitive while keeping the gameplay at a qualitatively high level. Also, this map uses so-called ninja notes. These are notes that appear at a significantly higher speed than normal notes, but you will have to play this map to see what I mean!

- [t+pazolite - Shiny Kung-fu Revival](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/352991) by [DakeDekaane](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1425253) (Nominator: [Ntiger](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766))

The fastest map this round is brought to you by DakeDekaane! Overall the set features very hard lower diffs, especially because of the BPM, but also because of the note density: the difficulties are as dense snapping-wise as slower songs (e.g. 1/2 in Futsuu), offering a very big challenge for newer players - something that we needed!
Another very notable thing about this set is the simplicity, as the maps are very structured but the patterns aren't very hard at all: On lower diffs they often switch colors every bar, making them easy to read, in the Oni the patterns are mostly based on 1/4 triplets.

- [SOUND HOLIC Vs. dj TAKA feat. YURiCa - TIEFSEE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/409533) by [ll-oscar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1488736) (Nominator: [S a n d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/676578))

"A WALKING TOILET". Unlike the previous Tiefsee we had last month, the map uses mutiple very well structured 1/4 streams which creates a very well emphasized difficulty curve at climaxs, and overhelmingly great for stream reading challenges. Along with very subtle slider velocity change in certain sections which makes the map a lot more visually interesting. Overall structure of the map is not merely splendid, but also the fact that it has a great blend between the vocal and the background is what truely makes the verses great. I still remember when you first ask me for a play test on this, and I was already satisfied by how well it played, but you've moved on to further enhance the map, which turns an averagely good walking toilet into a true top notch walking toilet.

- [Vospi - We Met Dat Night](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/437130) by [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766) (Nominator: [Hanjamon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1703330))

A very interesting map, I had fun playing all difficulties, especially Oni (DT) and Inner Oni. The placement and usage of 1/6 + 1/12 are pretty good and the same goes for the usage of finishers. The map itself is well structured and consistent. I don't have much to say since these kind of maps aren't common in Taiko and it would be nice if we have more like these.

### osu!catch

- **[Bitter Sweet Entertainment - Kanashimi no Mukougawa (Piano Version)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/435287) by [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508)** (Nominator: [Chara](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284))

The top pick for this month isn't the usual osu!catch Overdose map, but it is still worthy of being selected. This hybrid mapset by JBHyperion is mapped in a way that makes this calm map a bit more interesting. The usage of high circle size for the highest difficulty spices things up a bit, and overall the whole set is a very solid one. Ride the waves of tranquility as you traverse this bittersweet journey through this map of melancholy.

- [Silent Siren - Hachigatsu no Yoru](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/431708) by [Kisses](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4276114) (Nominator: [Chara](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284))

It's a bit odd for a song titled "August Night" to be picked for the September charts, but that's not the important thing! This cheerful and romantic convert map by Kisses features a fairly even spread, with the two highest difficulties having a lot of fun jumps and patterns. Relinquish the memories fleeting with romance as you jump with joy from this map filled with charm!

- [Breaking Benjamin - The Diary of Jane](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/468418) by [FCL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4715762) (Nominator: [Kurokami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/260933))

This set because of the many difficulty has a good spread for osu!catch which could satisfy many types of player. The Hard+ is similar to a Platter and while the two Insane can't be compared with Rains, they fitting between Hard and Expert very well. Among the two Expert level there is one with higher Circle Size which means the fruits are smaller, and one with more and harder jump which, I think, is good. Enjoy.

- [Hanatan - Attakain Dakara](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/464644) by [Stjpa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2954693) (Nominator: [Kurokami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/260933))

Even though in this set the osu!catch specific is not a full one I still like it. The Rain is not a challenging one but has well placed jumps and HyperDashes. In my opinion this is how this difficulty should look like. The Platter is also great and has a good flow along with well placed jumps. The osu! difficulties are making this set complete. Great work guys!

- [MY FIRST STORY - Kimi no Uta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/477055) by [Feb](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4571914) (Nominator: [Zak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375955))

This map has a well build structure. The beginning is slow paced therefore the movements are small and even if there is a jump, its easy to handle. But when it comes to the kiai the patterns are starting to be more complicated. There are jump in and out from streams, even the streams could be hard at first for a non-experience player. I like this.

- [Amane - TWEEKER](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/257165) by [TicClick](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/672931) (Nominator: [Zak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375955))

I like how the difficulty is increasing in this mapset. Starting from Hard the jumps starts to appear and as we go up they are become much harsher. This is a great set for those whos are want to learn how to jump in and out from a stream without missing a note or two.

### osu!mania

- **[Senpi- - Touhou EX Boss Rush!! +a Kouhen](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/165924) by [RuberusuScarlet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2534632)** (Nominator: [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717))

For me the absolute highlight of this month. osu!mania really rarely get marathon maps ranked which are above of 6 minutes+ and Ruberusu did rank a mania map which is 18 minutes long! For now this is the longest osu!mania beatmap which ever got ranked. While the map itself isn't that hard to play it never get's boring. It has everything from heavy LongNotes sections to more dense jumpstreams. Additionally to this it has a storyboard which fit very well with the beatmap. Every song has his own background with the character whose theme is played right now. With so much effort in one beatmap it is for me the best of the month september.

- [Yooh - salvation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/459200) by [pporse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4991434) (Nominator: [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737))

pporse is back with his 7K marathon maps! pporse's maps are generally known for its buttery smooth patterning and flow structure, while not sacrificing the sheer difficulty. This map includes some nice use of SVs throughout the map, and has appropriate layering and long note usage that closely follow the song. While the second half of the song is pretty repetitive, the varied patterns that pporse uses for each repetition makes the map more memorable. Overall, very nicely structured.

- [Chino(CV.Minase Inori) - Shinsaku no Shiawase wa Kochira!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/461904) by [[Emiria]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2046044) (Nominator: [-Kamikaze-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783))

Yet another great 7+1K mapset by Emiria, also known as victorica_db. When I first heard the song, I thought "That's going to probably be pretty boring", but the IIDX inspired patterning and very creative scratch placement makes it a total blast to play.
Even despite song's relatively calm atmosphere and slow pace, it doesn't get boring at all. A great accuracy chart for higher end players and a hard technical one for those who aren't that proficient at 8K.

- [Nizikawa - Isuzu no TRACK](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/399377) by [Frim4503](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2945775) (Nominator: [-Kamikaze-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783))

A 5K marathon! That's a rare sight, which makes me very happy.
A rather complex track with very complex patterning running at 170 BPM which accompannied by OD and HP 9 makes it a very good challenge for everyone, be it playing for accuracy, FCs or just clears.
Nearly 7 minutes of antimeta complextro goodness!

- [EX INDUSTRY - Memory](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/486597) by [ZZHBOY](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1565739) (Nominator: [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737))

A pretty simple 7K chart by ZZHBOY. This mapset features two relatively easy difficulties, both of which are hitsounded with pitched samples to go with the main melody of the song. In addition, the patterns follow pitch relevancy, which is always pleasant when combined with a calm, melodic music. This chart is definitely worth taking a look at.

- [t+pazolite - CENSORED!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/476221) by [Kuo Kyoka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596306) (Nominator: [-Kamikaze-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783))

Yet another energetic t+pazolite 4K set. Running at 195 bpm, this set has a wide range of difficulties for everyone to enjoy. SY's UNCENSORED focusing mostly on pure jumpstream with heavy chords and roll bursts inbetween jumpstream sections, while DECADE's GRAVITY is built on more trill-based patterning with some tricky LNs here and there. Overall one of the most enjoyable mid-tier 4K sets ranked lately.

**The September 2016 ranking charts will end on the 15th November 2016.**
