With 2015 finally over and the new year well under way, it's time to take a moment to nominate your favorite maps from last year - from every mode!

For the first time ever in osu! history, the yearly "Best of" voting is now **fully mode-based**, meaning that you can vote for your favorite maps in all of the modes you play, instead of just standard!

Head on over to [the voting page](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/bestof2015) and vote for **ten** of your favorite maps from 2015.

You can only vote for maps that you have played before.

The voting will end once we have enough votes to declare the top twelve maps of 2015. The three most highly-voted maps in each mode will be chosen, with the most popular map receiving **6 months of supporter status** for their efforts, while second and third place will receive **two months** and **one month** respectively.

Choose wisely, and good luck to all those who submitted their maps in 2015!

Keep your eyes on the horizon during 2016, as we've got a whole bunch of new things slated to take place over the course of the year!
