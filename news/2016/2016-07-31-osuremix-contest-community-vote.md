Hello everyone! The submission deadline for the ["circles!" remix contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-05-06-osu-circles-remix-contest) has been reached. With a very impressive turnout of 21 submitted remixes, we're more than ready to find out which of the remixes are considered to be the best by the community!

This vote will run much like the yearly "best of 20xx" map contests. Each person can vote for three different remixes that they consider to be their favourites. The deadline for voting is Monday, August 15 at 00:00:00 UTC, with the remix that tallied the most votes towards it being the winner!

To listen to all of the remixes and vote, [head on over to the voting page found here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/1)

Now a few people may be wonder who won the staff vote. Well sorry guys, we're keeping that a secret until the community vote has finished. You'll just have to keep wondering for the time being!

With that being said, best of luck to all entrants to the contest, and may the best remix win!

â€”Tasha
