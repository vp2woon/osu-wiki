A good storyboard can bring a map to life in ways we have never thought possible. Today, we show our appreciation to one of the members of the community who bring us expertly crafted animations rendered at the same frame rate the game is running at. That's right, Storyboard Showcases are back!

Before we get into today's storyboard, let's get some specifics about how the new storyboard showcases will work out of the way first:

- **Storyboard showcases will now feature insight from the storyboarder in the form of either an interview or a written paragraph.** Hopefully, this will help us grow the storyboarding community in a new and interesting way.
- **Selection of the storyboard featured will alternate between a popularly suggested storyboard and a staff-picked storyboard.** This time, since it's a new thing, we'll be starting with a storyboard that I picked. [Be sure to send your suggestions for storyboards to be featured here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Xfte9v2WY7R9jr08m-e8cUCIfwdyKbWKkdufePhMEiM/viewform?usp=send_form)
- **Storyboard Showcases will now happen regularly monthly.** The previous intervals proved a little dense to put in brief.

Without further ado, let's take a look at the first storyboard: [yuiko & Meis Clauson - Aozora Memories](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/349062) by [Gelbana](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Gelbana)!

**The storyboard to Aozora Memories is a modest yet appealing interpretation of the song.** The minimalistic elements of the storyboard are brought to life with the impressive  implementation of animated typography via tiny dots. Needless to say, the size of the download (the .osb was pretty fat) was properly justified when you got to see each individual dot fly across the screen to form new visualizations and flash pretty colours!

**I had the opportunity to ask Gelbana some questions regarding the creation of Aozora Memories.** [You can read about our encounter here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/169TMnRpQakH0ds36cDU9zgHMuJ6xwo_4EROic_L88mc/pub)

With that, we have the conclusion of the first Monthly Storyboard Showcase. Did this feature help you learn something new today? Let us know in the comments! I'll be monitoring your submissions for what you would like to see next month attentively, so be sure to send those storyboards in.
