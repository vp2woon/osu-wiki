## What has been changed?

- We added more clear regulations regarding disconnects and inappropriate behavior during the matches.
- We added a cash prize pool for this competition! Additionally, everyone is able to support funding this prize pool by purchasing support banners for their user profile when available.
- We adjusted the mappool structure. There is no a NoMod and a FreeMod bracket, where FreeMod allows the usage of HardRock and Flashlight. One player per team must play with one mod on a FreeMod beatmap. NoMod forces everyone to play NoMod. Optionally, everyone can activate Hidden or FadeIn at any map they choose.
- We adjusted the mappool size and ban amounts for balancing purposes. Teams may only ban 1 beatmap each per match now. All mappools now have a constant size of 15 across all stages, with 10 NoMod, 4 FreeMod and 1 Tiebreaker beatmap.
- We will use ScoreV2 for this tournament. Check out **[this thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/466617)** for more information.

## Prizes

We are aiming to have a $1,900 cash prize pool for this world cup. You can support raising this amount of money. We will publish a method for that, as soon as we have it available!

- 1st: 50% of the raised prize pool, profile badge, "osu!mania Champion" user title
- 2nd: 38% of the raised prize pool, profile badge
- 3rd: 12% of the raised prize pool, profile badge

## How do I register?

- **[Click here to sign-up!](https://osu.ppy.sh/tournaments/6)**
- Do not create teams in advance! Teams will be formed after registration phase concluded by country's team captains.
- Hand in your registration before **17. July 2016.**

Note that you can only participate if you are of a **osu!mania global ranking of #5000 or higher and did not violate the [osu! community rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months**.

If your registration was successful, you will be put on the candidate list of your country. Whenever a captain for your country has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

_Remember that any registrations past the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances - so get your registrations done early to avoid any last-minute issues._
