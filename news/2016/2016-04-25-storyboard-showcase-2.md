It was almost to be expected, but an overwhelming majority of people who submitted a storyboard for us to showcase picked the same one! This month, we'll be taking a look at the swan song of the retired Community Contributor Charles445.

**Well, there's certainly a lot of things that can be said about [Charles445](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/85000)'s [DM vs. POCKET - uNDeRWoRLD MoNaRCHy](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/412938).** Fans of Undertale will be glad to know that this storyboard contains no spoilers to the unsuspecting player. I highly doubt that will be the first thing fans will care about, however, as this storyboard is jam packed with awesome references and subtle nods.

**Frankly, Charles445 has cut out the work for me by releasing his code and providing insightful comments in it.** You can take a look at how the entire thing comes together using SGL [here](https://puu.sh/mWnWK/db025a7b22.sgf). Whether you are a seasoned storyboarder looking to have a giggle, or a new storyboarder looking to learn, there is something to be seen for everyone!

**This time, Charles445 has let me do a proper interview with him over a call.** I have made a short transcript for the important points. If you would like, you can also listen to the entire thing [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HnCvBQk0v2BYkIt-8fB5eWE9TLJMd6H-RVnXrWykgiM/edit?usp=sharing).

That sums up this month's storyboard showcase! Next month, I'll be featuring a staff pick to spice things up a little. However, we'll be back to picking storyboards from the ones you guys give us soon after, so  be sure to [keep those submissions coming](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Xfte9v2WY7R9jr08m-e8cUCIfwdyKbWKkdufePhMEiM/viewform?usp=send_form)!
