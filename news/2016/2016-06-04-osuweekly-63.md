**peppy has sounded the call to arms for development aid!** With early contributors making their way into the new 'lazer' development repository, the big man has now [requested reinforcements](https://twitter.com/ppy/status/737529593184149504) on the website side of things. If you fancy yourself well versed in the discipline of  code-fu, check out the [github issues tracker](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/issues) for things you can help with!

**The time has come to bid goodbye to May and say hello to a new community poll!** This time, we want to know what the osu! community thinks of other games. Do you enjoy playing osu in the background between competitive matches? Or maybe you turn on the game as a way to relieve the stress of working together with a dozen other people to take down a boss. Whatever the case, let us know in the thread!

**With this weekly popping up at such an odd time, the old community poll results are here as well!** It looks like the question we asked was on point, as this past week has been a host for many meetings around the world. From absolutely massive meetups such as Anime North, to smaller appointments between well known mappers in europe, many players had the opportunity to come together and have some fun.

**The osu!idol contest made its grand return just a few moments ago.** Do you have what it takes to charm the judges and win over the competition? The osu!community is filled with amazing vocal talent, so don't expect to have it easy! Check out the official post for more information.

**The osu! development team had its [monthly development meeting](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/145391467603/2016-05-dev-meeting) a few days ago!** In brief, development is being kicked into gear and contributors are needed to help speed up the process. Be sure to follow [peppy's blog](https://blog.ppy.sh) for future dev updates!

This week, we are trialing some brand new guest content! Feel free to give us feedback on what and who you would like to see appear on the weekly!

**osu! at Anime North 2016**

*Written by Evrien*

A party full of drunk top players, a rhythm gaming room that suddenly erupted into a Brain Power sing-along, MiruHong and -Soba- suddenly embracing a newfound love for tree-climbing outside of busy convention halls – These are just a handful of many memorable scenes that happened over the course of the weekend of May 28th at the Anime North 2016 convention in Toronto, Canada. A tradition among North American players designated this convention as the "annual osu! summit", and it was every bit true to this title.

The gathering was long announced within the North American community, and attracted more than 50 osu! participants – not just top players but also streamers, mappers, artists, community organizers, and many more. If you happened to have noticed on Twitter, many accounts suddenly included an "\@AN2016" tag to indicate attendance. While some players were unable to attend personally, they showed "camaraderie" (read as "salt") by sporting the tag nonetheless. At the convention signatures were traded, stories were shared over dinner tables, and a certain drunk American player assaulted Azer using an empty box of timbits. Team Canada from OWC 2015 also partially reunited (no pun intended) and produced a rare group photo. Amidst all of this chaos, jonathanlfj demonstrated live the process of ranking a map with the help of Kibbleru. Needless to say, it was not something one can expect to see every day.

Alas the 72 hours of the convention passed by way too quickly, and parting has always been hard to bear. While it was the first time for many players to finally see each other offline, the times we shared as a community made our bonds just as lasting as they can be, and a simple "hello" may quickly turn into playful banters of long-time friends. A number of players already made plans for their next convention where they hope to reconvene the fun. As for now, here is a picture to commemorate this unique chapter in the osu! community.

**The osu!catch World Cup 2016 Round of 16 has concluded with a lot of unexpected results.** Poland, Germany, France, United States, Argentina, Japan, Hong Kong, and Indonesia advanced in Winner's bracket while Sweden, South Korea, Singapore, Canada, Mexico, Taiwan, Russian Federation, and China dropped to the Loser's bracket.

**The round began with a match from the finalists of the osu!catch World Cup 2014, South Korea and Germany.** South Korea and Germany traded wins, but an awesome performance by Germany late in the match took it to a tiebreaker. South Korea seemed about to win the match as \_Asriel was the only player who used Hidden in Tiebreaker to pump up South Korea's score, but a single miss from \[224\]Reol at the very end of the song caused Germany to take over the lead and win the match.

**Another surprising moment came from the match between China vs Indonesia**, where Indonesia held out against the tournament favorite team China with a stunning 5 - 2. The performance between China and Indonesia contrasted greatly; team China, led by current \#1 osu!catch player Dusk, was not in good shape and made a lot of mistakes, while Indonesia played every map calmly.

Only France and Indonesia managed to achieve full team SS ranks in this round, both achieved on
Sakaue Nachi - Light travel distance RAYTO MIX (Frostmourne) \[Lunatic\]

sakuzyo - Altale (toybot) \[AFB's Rain\], the most picked song, amassed 7 picks in the round. Comedian Harmonists - Perpetuum Mobile (Bonsai) \[Pluvium Hyperionis\] and RADWIMPS - Jugemu (Amir) \[Ursa's Platter\] came behind in second.

I hope you all had a great time reading some stuff not written by me for a change! If received well, I'll look to getting even more community content featured in the weekly. Until then, you can send what kinds of things you would like to see appear in next week's publication at **[news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh)**. If you see something wrong, and there may very well be, leave us a comment and I'll try to fix it ASAP!
