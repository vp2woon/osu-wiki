It's a given that osu! would not be as amazing as it is without the awesome community that backs it up. This goes out to the great team behind community moderation, to the individuals who provide cool and interesting tools that change the way you play, and to those who stop at nothing to spread the love of circle clicking. A new wave of community contributor badges have arrived!

A long time has passed since we last gave our appreciation to the members of the community in the form of a Community Contributor Badge. During this time, many more have taken up the task of aiding in community development with their skills and expertise. The osu! staff encourages all members of the community, new and old, to participate and contribute their abilities to help grow the game we all know and love.

The ones receiving the badge today are not the only ones who contribute to the cause. However, these members of the community have gone above and beyond. They have dedicated an exceptional amount of time and effort into making the osu! community a better place. To these members of the community, we give you our everlasting gratitude.

Without further ado, here are the new users that now bear proudly the mark of a Community Contributor!

**Distinguished Moderators [[Saten](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Saten), [Flanster](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Flanster) (previously LoliFlan), [Nathanael](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Nathanael)]**  - Even before becoming a GMT, Saten always took it a step further with forum moderation by revolutionizing the way we deal with user profiles. Since he started, he has identified and dealt with over 30000 infringements over the course of 3 years. Flanster and Nathanael have also contributed immensely over the years, handling over 10000 infringements and have stuck with us for a similar length of time. Without the efforts of these upstart individuals (and other like minded people), the osu! in-game chat would be a something of a lawless wasteland!

**[Tasha](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Tasha)** - Before Tasha joined the osu!news team, the state of front page announcements was a lot different from what it is now. The predecessor to the idea of weekly articles to keep players updated on the game came long before him, but it wasn't until he took the helm that they really started to kick off. Since March, we have had 42 editions of the osu!weekly, 32 of which was completely the fruits of one man's labor. Being the current editor of the weekly, I can't help but feel a sense of awe at Tasha's quality and consistency of content within his posts.

**[ztrot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/ztrot)** - Being one of the first to head official media content, ztrot has invested hundreds of hours labouring to create the osu!academy series. Since ztrot started work on osu! related videos, the osu!academy YouTube channel has amassed over 15 thousand subscribers and over 1.5 million views. His videos have helped new and old players alike enjoy the game even more than we already did.

Have you seen anyone do anything cool around the community? Let us know at **[news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh)**!  The staff behind osu! are always looking to reward members of the community for their efforts. We'll be mentioning other neat things people are doing in the weekly as well, and subsequently select from those people for future Community Contributor Badges.
