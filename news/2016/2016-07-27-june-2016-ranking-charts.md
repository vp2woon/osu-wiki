We apologize for the delay as stuff went a bit up and down, but by now, the Ranking Charts for June 2016 have been finally released and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1606)!

This month our dedicated top chart and general players, [Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493), [tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767), [_Asriel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276) and [Runa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4643294) picked the maps for the Monthly Ranking Charts.

## Ranking Charts Creation

The charts have previously been created by letting four dedicated community members select the most noteworthy maps of this month. We also reward the top beatmap in each category by providing **1 month of supporter status** to the mapper.

### osu!

For osu!, we decided to let **[Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493)** pick their favourite maps.

- **[Hatsuki Yura - Eclipse Parade](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/430339) by [Vert](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3420746)**

This mapset is the one I like the most in this month, which is why I choose it as my favorite. Beside the song being very catchy with its 1/3 beats and having a nice vocalist(which I really like!), there are difficulties with interesting triplet spaced streams or a lot of doubles I find apealing to play. It is also fun trying to get high accuracy on the slower parts of the beatmap, and the addition of a difficulty with AR8 makes the whole thing complete for me!

- [Camellia - crystallized](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/399151) by [Smoothie World](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1855540)

Overall a well balanced map which near the end I find really fun to play. Also, I should mention handsome's difficulty with its CS3 difficulty, which might appear to be a bit awkward since this is not very usual, but in my opinion still fun to play.

- [Ocelot - TSUBAKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/364574) by [Hollow Wings](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/416662)

I actually enjoyed playing the EX EX beatmap since it contains a very unusual style with a lot of insanely fast sliders which are a nice challenge. But not only that, the set contains a lot of other difficulties which are interesting on their own.

- [IOSYS - Cirno no Perfect Sansuu Kyoushitsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/392215) by [alacat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/869782)

The hardest difficulty is a very unique one since it doesn't contain any of the common game mechanics which osu! normaly bears: Spinners and Sliders are not present and that's actually also what makes it so hard. You need a lot of control to be able to play all the 1/4 patterns, and the doubles and quadruplets are making the whole thing even harder.

- [Chitose Haru & Kumagai Eri - Perfect Free](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/456387) by [RLC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1047883)

Actually there is not much I have to say about the beatmap. I love the slider velocity changes as they give the beatmap a certain touch. That's why I believe it fits for these charts.

- [FELT - Lies in Reality](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/412270) by [captin1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/689997)

To be honest there is not much I have to say about this difficulty either, beside it having a stable difficulty for about 6 minutes which makes playing it rather balanced.

### osu!taiko

For osu!taiko, we asked **[tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767)** about their favourite maps in June 2016.

- **[Demetori - Kagayaku Hari no Kobito-zoku ~ Counter-Attack of the Weak](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/408861) by [MMzz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/128993)**

It's the greatest stamina map made by MMzz. Consistent patterns, flow, selection of pick up sounds including 1/3 and 1/6, and density of each parts are all perfect. Then look at the streams: they have natural flow, sound beautiful and furthermore, are fun for playing. I think it's the most charming point! Even If you don't have enough playing skill, you can be impressed by watching experts' replay or autoplay. Let's try!

- [BlackY - Harpuia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/295703) by [OzzyOzrock](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/465153)

A beatmap which was present in the Taiko World Cup 2016! As well known, SOUND VOLTEX songs are good for mania, but I also think they are good for Taiko since most of these songs have a lot of varying sounds which are good for making interesting patterns. Inner Oni is a good example as it contains many of these interesting patterns such as finishers, complicated streams and some 1/6 patterns which all of them fit to the sound very well and make a nice flow. Especially the climax part is great. I recommend you to play this beatmap, it will give you surprise and dense time.

- [VINXIS - Greetings](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/288974) by [Okorin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405)

These osu!taiko difficulties were made by the well known osu! standard mapper Okora-, eh... Okorin. Oni doesn't have many changes in placement or any complicated 1/4 patterns, but conversely it has many changes of the colors. I think this exquisite balance is the secret to take full advantage of the song while keeping a simple map. The relatively non-generic triplets make that clear: dkd, kdk, kdd are used clean and shows mapper's ability in mapping osu!taiko. I would like to see more of his Taiko beatmaps!

- [Yooh - Dynasty -da capo-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/434695) by [Backfire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/263110)

Collaboration with qoot8123 and a full version of SOUND VOLTEX songs. Although it is a 6 minute song, the difficulty has many interesting patterns and Slider Velocities, so that it never becomes boring. I felt like wanting continue playing it indefinitely. Especially the 1/6 patterns and long streams are nice! Both mappers' parts are mixed well and support each other, so I can say for sure that this is truely a great collaborated beatmap.

- [m-flo - LOVER (el poco maro Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/419727) by [SKSalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3280542)

I chose an approval map again since June is an "approval month". Very beautiful song; a nice song selection! This map is made faithfully to the sound, and it doesn't have much change of placement, so we can relax and enjoy it. I felt that the first half of kiai time is especially good. Same patterns are used at many times, but I didn't felt bored because, the original rhythm is interesting and the doublets work pretty well on it. I believe this map will give you a comfy time.

- [t+pazolite - Electric "Sister" Bitch](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/428123) by [Shinzo-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4720038)

Amazing Touhou song remixed by t+pazolite. I think that the most charming point in this set is Inner Oni's kiai times. In the first and third, all streams are based on kddkddk/dkkdkkd. However, each patterns have a slight difference so we never really feel bored about them. In the second and fourth kiai, the base rhythm is moving from kddkddk to the actual melody though the structure of some kddkddk patterns are still kept in bound, which makes all sections be connected to eachother in a natural way. Let's play it and gain some pp as well!

### osu!catch

For osu!catch, **[_Asriel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276)** was the chosen one to declare the winners of the June 2016 beatmaps.

- **[ginkiha - EOS (kamome sano rmx)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/404360) by [Broccoly](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1629059)**

Here is another masterpiece of Spectator. Do you remember this map as the tiebreaker map of 2016 CWC Group Stage? Of course it has marvelous quality as his other maps. The patterns are well matched with the song and perfect hitsounds made this be for me the winner of the June Ranking Chart in osu!catch. Although the map's difficulty is about Rain, you may have the skills to achieve full combo on other Overdoses easily.

- [Memme - Acid Burst](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/302535) by [Priti](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2198472)

This map includes the feature of hyperdash especially found in osu!catch maps. Because of many different kinds of patterns, you may need the experiences about high tier osu!catch beatmaps and perfect moving skills. If you want to improve yourself as an osu!catch player, this might be the chance to increase your moving skills. Good Luck on that, since you will be enfolded with Acid Burst if you can't control your catcher!

- [Wakeshima Kanon - World's End, Girl's Rondo(Asterisk DnB Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/440862) by [CLSW](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/531253)

First volume of the World's End, Girl's Rondo series maps in osu!catch. Although this map used a lot of hyperdashs, it increased its enjoyability and did not made the map be boring. Maintaining 8bit hyperdash jumps and streams whos shape is like stairs will require fit endurance and techniques. If you face a hard time on either patterns, you will not accomplish a high combo on this song.

- [Inferi - Those Who from the Heavens Came](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/387311) by [Mazzerin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2942381)

Approach Rate 10 with high BPM may be challengeable assignment for the most osu!catch players. Although the most patterns are just stream, you must take care of full plate walk patterns and 8bit jumps appearing at times. Also, Rapid Fruits and crazy hyperdash will prevent you from passing this map. Do you want a tip? Bananas are your enemies.

- [DragonForce - Seasons](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/449873) by [Spaghetti](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4761930)

DragonForce song and Circle Size 5. This beatmap setting that can't be found easily around osu!catch will give you the chance to reevaluate the patterns you thought of being ordinary, in case you didn't play Circle Size 5 maps yet. This map also reminded me of lesjuh's mapping style. If you are not good at moving on Circle Size 5, hard / edge dashes, anti-flow jumps and tangled streams will disturb maintaining combo. To offer a experience of variety, I picked this converted beatmap.

- [Tatsh - IMAGE -MATERIAL-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/399585) by [Bara-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2533040)

This pick is not intended to look like a joke. I would just like to give everyone the possibility to use whatever mod they want on a beatmap with an Approach Rate of 6. Try adding mods as many as possibly you can! Hidden, Hard Rock, Double Time and even Flashlight. The possible variation of mods is large on this beatmap. They are waiting for you!

### osu!mania

For osu!mania, **[Runa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4643294)** was able to select their personal most noteworthy beatmap from last month.

- **[Shoujo - Reminiscing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/435851) by [- R e b a -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3087654)**

A 7k mapset with a sweet electronic song. This mapset has four 7k difficulties which have a balanced difficulty spread that expresses off-beats, long notes, and slider velocitys appropriately. What I thought of the most impressive thing about this beatmap is the clear 1/8 brusts using glissando. Overall, this is a very solid map, and I'd like to recommend this map to any player seeking to mash some keys.

- [LeaF - LeaF Style Super*Shredder](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/372278) by [nowsmart](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1935034)

The hardest 5k map has been replaced in June 2016! As a 255BPM hardcore LeaF style song, there is quite a lot of 1/8 sounds and some tricky rhythms, and this map expressed those really well. Above all, I was impressed by the well fitting slider velocitys with tricky rhythms and the fun and creative minijacks. The hardest streams with many 1/8 notes are waiting for you at the kiai time. Make sure to prepare yourself!

- [Kaneko Chiharu - Lachryma<queen>](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/415886) by [Fresh_Chicken](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3984370)

Speedcore 4k mapset from SDVX. It is consists mainly of 236BPM jumpstreams and trills, while the GRAVITY difficulty has more creative and complex patterns like streams with long notes, jump hand streams and delay patterns, which I personally really like. Finally, when you thought the song was over, a super long trill is waiting to surprise you. Keep that in mind when playing!

- [Camellia as "Bang Riot" - Blastix Riotz](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/349208) by [Fresh_Chicken](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3984370)

I heard Fresh Chicken was planning to rank a 7 star 4k map from 2015, and that finally came true in June 2016! It is a 256BPM speedcore song from SDVX, which requires you to have very high speed and stamina to play it. The map is based on long trills and streams. Especially in the GRAVITY difficulty, really hard minijacks and 1/12 notes that benefits a 7-star 4k beatmap waits for you. Feel the true 256BPM experience on your fingertips through this beatmap!

- [Chata - Dango Daikazoku - TV animation Ver. -](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/314954) by [Julie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2420987)

The 7k mapset that consists of only 2 difficulties -'easy piano' and 'normal piano'- which expresses a very slow and calm song. However, there is something special about this piano-map hitsounds! Every note has a hitsound and works like piano keys, so it will feel as if you are actually playing the piano while playing this beatmap. Morever, the easy difficulty is only 0.9 stars, so you can try it even if you don't have any experience playing osu!mania. I would recommend this map to any player that seeks fresh experience while playing rhythm games!

- [S3RL feat Krystal - R4V3 B0Y](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/407186) by [Draftnell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3406652)

A happy hardcore song with simple and balanced patterns. This mapset consists of three 4k difficulties and 6k difficulties. The patterns are mainly simple, but some parts turn into 1/3 pattren. And the long notes describe the electronic sound really well. Generally I thought, the map is very solid, and with this map's high-quality storyboard, it will help you feel the music.
