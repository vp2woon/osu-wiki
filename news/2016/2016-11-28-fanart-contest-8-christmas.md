With Christmas just around the corner, preparations for the coming cheer are in full swing. To celebrate, we're hosting another Fanart Contest - with a theme you can probably already guess!

Following from the tremendous success of Halloween's fanart contest, we've decided to keep the osu! tradition alive and push for some special decorations for this year's festivities. Whip out your drawing implement of choice and prepare some red, green and white swatches, because the theme for this year's contest is none other than:

**The mascots at Christmas!**

*Just to clarify, you don't have to actually use red, white or green in your piece if you don't want to! Literary exposition and all that jazz.*

Much like the [Halloween fanart contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-10-19-flash-fanart-contest-7-halloween), **this includes the community-submitted mascots** from previous contests, even ones that didn't end up in the top 3. You can of course, use your own renditions of pippi, Yuzu, Maria and even pippi-don if you see fit. As long as it's an osu! mascot and is vaguely Christmas themed, you're all set!

The top 10 voted entries and any other honorable mentions (as determined by the staff) will be bundled into the game as main-menu decorations, just like Halloween! The artists for each of the chosen entries will also receive 2 months of osu!supporter for their efforts, and in the spirit of Christmas cheer, a month of osu!supporter that they can gift to a friend of their choosing.

**The contest will accept entries for 20 days from the date of this post, ending on 20th December 00:00 UTC.**

## Rules

- Artists should use the custom templates provided: [PSD template](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16332218/osu%21%20Title%20Screen%202732x1536.psd) / [PNG template](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16332218/osu%21%20Title%20Screen%202732x1536.png).
- **The templates above denote WHERE THE osu! COOKIE IS LOCATED IN THE MAIN MENU.** Anything inside the circle probably isn't going to be seen by anyone on the main-menu, so make sure to remember that when composing your piece!
- All entries must be at least vaguely Christmas themed in some way or another, be it through costume, setting or otherwise.
- Submit only your own work! Don't plagiarise. While Christmas is about sharing, sharing is not caring when it comes to using other people's work as your own.
- Don't use copyrighted characters from other intellectual properties. The community-submitted mascots from previous contests are free to be used, but remember that these designs are somebody else's creation, so make sure to treat them with the same respect that you'd want shown to your work.
- Entries must meet the size requirements for a main-menu piece (at least 1366x768, or higher. 2732x1536 is optimal wherever possible.)

Entering the contest pretty much says to us that you're okay with us using your art on the osu! website and promoting it via social media accounts. We'll ALWAYS give credit where credit is due - creative work is hard enough without other people trying to steal all the credit for your hard work!
