The osu! community is comprised of hundreds of thousands of people. Among this huge number are a selection of incredible individuals who go far beyond the rest in their contributions to the community, and make the game better for everyone as a result. To celebrate November, we're announcing a new round of Community Contributor Badges and a new entrant into the osu! Hall of Fame.

## Community Contributors

Community contributors are a select pick of long-term members of the community that have given huge portions of their time and effort towards making things more awesome for people. While not every effort they make is visible to all people, recipients of the badge are undoubtedly a positive influence on the community and exemplify everything that we could ever want from the osu! community as a whole.

    <p style="text-align:center;"><b><a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418">pishifat</a></b></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><i>Exemplary performance in beatmap construction and education</i></p>
</div>

Arguably one of the most well-known members of the BNG and a very recent addition to the QAT, pishifat is renowned in the modding community for his expansive knowledge of beatmap construction in most of its forms. He has created numerous commentary and demonstration videos explaining complex mapping techniques in depth over on [his youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw08OgdNiLUID64IrtqSOUA). Beyond this, he is also one of the very few people within the community capable of timing multi-bpm tracks accurately, a talent that has been possessed by less than a dozen people throughout osu!'s history, and one that he freely shares with people requiring it for their maps. pishifat exemplifies the core ideal of the osu! community with his keen drive to help improve the game and make things more awesome for everyone involved.

    <p style="text-align:center;"><b><a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405">Okorin</a></b></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><i>Exceptional leadership in beatmap management affairs</i></p>
</div>

Quickly rising to prominence as a member of the QAT, Okorin has made himself a household name in the affairs of beatmapping and criteria management. His work as a QAT and among the leadership structures of beatmap management has been instrumental in the improvement of the Ranking Criteria overall, and his selfless drive to see the task done right is something that we want to greatly encourage in others.

    <p style="text-align:center;"><b><a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1856463">IamKwaN</a></b></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><i>Outstanding moderation presence and overall contribution</i></p>
</div>

IamKwaN (affectionately dubbed Kwan by most of the team) has arguably been one of the most active members of the GMT in recent years, balancing her workload as a QAT all the while. Outside of handling her chief purview in a variety of Asian community channels, Kwan continues to grace both teams with her inscrutable drive to make things better for everyone. Beyond her efforts as a moderator, she is also a prime contributor to the ongoing effort of standardizing metadata across osu!'s numerous languages and cultures - an absolutely leviathan task. She has quickly risen to become a core member of the volunteer team, and we're delighted to have her with us.

<div align="center">
    <p><img src="https://a.ppy.sh/722665" style="width: 120px; height: 120px"></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b><a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/722665">Marcin</a></b></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><i>Outstanding contribution to community affairs, organization and moderation</i></p>
</div>

A mainstay presence within the development and moderation team for many years, much of Marcin's work has been beyond the scope of the public eye. From assistance with organizing and streaming many of our official tournaments, to producing a variety of prototype solutions for many smaller issues, Marcin's mark on osu! is a subtle one, but indelible for certain. We're very happy to have had him with us.

<div align="center">
    <p><img src="https://a.ppy.sh/5044384" style="width: 120px; height: 120px"></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b><a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5044384">LiquidPL</a></b></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><i>Outstanding development contribution (osu!next)</i></p>
</div>

One of the first early open-source devs and a major contributor to the osu!next website design effort, LiquidPL is one of the community's most proactive developers that have gotten engaged with us since the beginning of our move to open source. His hard work and dedication to numerous design implementations have greatly sped up work on the redesign, and he is chiefly responsible for a number of views all on his own. LiquidPL's drive and mettle exemplifies that which we'd love to see more of in the community.

<div align="center">
    <p><img src="https://a.ppy.sh/682935" style="width: 120px; height: 120px"></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b><a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/682935">Nyquill</a></b></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><i>Outstanding community contribution (osu!weekly)</i></p>
</div>

During his tenure as our dedicated osu!weekly editor, Nyquill has provided the community with weekly snapshots of the goings-on for close to two years straight with very little breaks. Despite the public-facing nature of his work, he has also assisted the development of the game in a variety of other domains, ranging from tournament management to player support. His varied efforts have greatly impacted the presentation of the game in his time with us, and we're very thankful to have him with us.

<div align="center">
    <p><img src="https://a.ppy.sh/91341" style="width: 120px; height: 120px"></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b><a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/91341">Derekku</a></b></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><i>Early community management and moderation</i></p>
</div>

Given in absentia for deeds long past, Derekku was once a community manager during different times. Tackling the inscrutable tangle of the BAT/MAT relationship in those days, Derekku's efforts were chiefly responsible for guiding the course of the game into the modern day. Much of the struggles of the earlier generation of osu! players are forgotten in more recent times, along with the personalities that helped bring the game into where it is today.

<div align="center">
    <p><img src="https://a.ppy.sh/3469385" style="width: 120px; height: 120px"></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b><a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3469385">Trosk-</a></b></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><i>Outstanding contribution to community affairs</i></p>
</div>

Much like Batman, most of Trosk-'s efforts lie well outside the public eye. Outside of his work as a member of the Support Team, Trosk-'s presence in general player support and management has been a great boon to the game, and we count his efforts as well among the core of what makes the osu! community so great.

<div align="center">
    <p><img src="https://a.ppy.sh/113005" style="width: 120px; height: 120px"></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b><a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/113005">Shiro</a></b></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><i>Outstanding contribution to moderation, organization and management</i></p>
</div>

A dauntless presence in the moderation team for many years, Shiro's efforts have been prevalent across many domains, stretching across beatmap and community moderation to even internal management and organization. Arguably one of the most reliable members of the volunteer staff team over the years, Shiro's presence in osu! continues to be a positive one, and her diligence and determination to get the job done are traits that we wish we saw more frequently in others.

## Elites

Elite titles represent the forefront of osu!'s high achievers in domains outside of competitive play. From mapping to modding, skinning to storyboarding, the Elite of osu! are all afforded a permanent place within the osu! Hall of Fame as members of the community who have an indelible imprint upon the artistic and creative development of the game.

<div align="center">
    <p><img src="https://a.ppy.sh/2559349" style="width: 120px; height: 120px"></p>
</div>

**We'd like to congratulate [Exile-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2559349) on receiving the honorary title of *Elite Storyboarder*.** Their incredible work on numerous storyboards over the years has advanced the face of the craft within the osu!community, and their talents are quickly becoming some of the most remarkable that we've ever seen.

Exile-'s recent work on [Mili - world.execute(me);](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/470977) is truly one of the most visually and technically impressive storyboards in the game, and we're almost certain that this level of technical expertise will have a profound influence on other creative minds looking to create their own works in the future.

</div>

In closing, I'd just like to say that there are of course a huge number of people doing incredible work in the community at this very moment. This list is by no means a "comprehensive" collection of everybody great - there's so many names out there working to help make osu! more awesome, and you can absolutely expect more of these types of posts in the future as we start to see others take up the mantle of progress.

You too, could have your name listed in the Hall of Fame one day, if you've got what it takes.
