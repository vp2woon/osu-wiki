**For the first time in a while, we have a new [development update](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/146687255823/a-long-overdue-update) from the team!** This main focus of the status report from the team seems to be to bring everyone up to speed with the hectic amounts of new code heading into the game. The 'lazer' branch of osu is now a much more complete version of the complete rewrite of everything osu! Is based upon. If you're a software developer yourself, you can go check out the out the [official dev discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/013KEJ9ERBQU595KN) to see if you can become one of the first to contribute to this soon to be open source repository!

**Our poll from June is now over with, for the first time, rather evenly distributed results!** What was most interesting for me in this poll actually happened in the thread. I had overlooked less explored genres (more than one of which I am a big fan of), which a lot of people who play osu! Seem to enjoy. Unfortunately, it means that this poll wasn't as all-inclusive as it could have been, but hopefully in the future we can expand upon player profiles to accommodate everyone more naturally!

**Ztrot has made [a thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/470212) in the forums to help answer any questions you may have about the current ranking process and the BNG.** If you are still unsure about the direction the BNG is taking as well as what the future looks like for beatmap ranking, the thread may already have some answers for you! That said, do try to read what has already been asked to avoid asking the same thing, it makes keeping the thread relevant easier!

**There is just way too many tournaments for us to talk about how exciting each one of them are!** While this may be the case, the osu!weekly is here to try to keep you in the know with some of the bigger upcoming and currently on-going competitions. Let's take a look at what's been brought to my attention this week!

- The [osu! Histy Championships (OHC)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/466836/start=0) is an international 4v4 osu!standard tournament that allows players to form their own teams with no rank limits. It's currently still in it's registration phase, so head on over if you're interested!
- The [Second Circle Championships](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/441098) is a third party sponsored 2v2 tournament that has some pretty big players participating.
- The OCWT concluded this passing weekend with the (definitely not overpowered) team SPD taking the top prize. There's a vod up for the [grand finals](https://www.twitch.tv/ocwt/v/74634469) over on the ocwt twitch channel, so you can go see it if you missed it!

**Just as I was about to push out this article, Flyte posted a new [update](https://next.ppy.sh/post/146744703858/this-weeks-teaser-is-not-so-much-of-a-teaser) for us on his blog!** It seems that flyte has gotten his rear in gear and started working away on some of his more old designs. I had a brief glance at the screenshots of the new userpage design, and it seems that quite a few things have been changed! Can you spot all the differences?

The osu!catch World Cup 2016 has concluded with Indonesia facing off again last years runner-up China in Grand Final. How was their journey to reach Grand Final?

<center>![](https://puu.sh/pMLj3/47284249df.png)</center>

As the Grand Final began, China picked Morimori Atsushi - PUPA (Cherry Blossom) \[Butterfly\] and Indonesia responded it by gained their first point.

Indonesia picked DJ Sharpnel - IVALTEK (happy30) \[HappyMiX\] in hope they could get their second point, but China was able to win it and made it tie 1 - 1. The performance of both teams were very contrast after the tie.; Indonesia's performance dropped down and made a lot of mistakes while China nailed everything calmly.

Without wasting time China tried to gain everything they could, closed the 1st round with a massive 7 - 1 win and proceed to 2nd match as China came from Loser Bracket and they needed another win to be crowned as World Champion.

Lost their first chance to win, Indonesia changed the strategy by picked different song in the first pick (Hitori Tori - perthed again (yambabom remix) (CLSW) \[Nervous Breakdown\]) in hope they could get their first point, but China was able to convert it to their point and made 4 - 1 lead shortly. Indonesia didn't want to give up, tried everything they can and they successfully chased their deficit to 4 - 3. Indonesia tried their last chance to win the remaining rounds in order to win the World Cup, but the on-fire China sealed the match with 7 - 3 and brought home World Champion title for second time as they have won it previously in 2012.

An honorable mention to Dusk (China) as the player who successfully made SS in same song (T.M.Revolution x Mizuki Nana - Preserved Roses (Xinely) \[Collab Insane\]) three times in a row.

**Registration for 4k World Cup has begun!** As usual, it doesn't quite make sense for me to say what has already been said already, so go check out the wiki page and the official post for more information!

It looks like that's all we have from this last week of June! Oh wait, it's already July? Well it looks like we're going to have to still work on some stuff over here, but do look forward to the new poll coming out soon. If you have any suggestions for what you would like to see in the weekly, feel free to drop by the [osu!dev discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/013KEJ9ERBQU595KN) and directly hilight me in #osu-weekly. Alternatively, you can also e-mail us as usual at [news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh).
