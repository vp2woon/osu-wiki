The results are in for the first ever osu!remix contest. Get ready to feast your ears on some awesome tracks!

A little while ago, we held our first official remix contest for one of osu!'s first ever exclusive tracks - *circles!*, by our in-house composer (and developer!) [nekodex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/nekodex). 21 talented musicians stepped forward and took their own spin on *circles!*, with everything from electronica to dubstep and beyond explored by our intrepid contestants.

To refresh everyone's memory, the contest is split into two prizes - a staff pick and a community vote. The staff pick consists of the members of osu!'s internal team personally voting for their favorite three tracks from the lot. The community vote functioned a bit differently, with everyone being given three votes to distribute across their favorite three tracks from the competition.

The staff's chosen winner would take home the major prize, with their **track being featured in osu! as an official contest map, $250 dollars (either in osu!store credit or equivalent giftcards), and a unique profile badge heralding their achievement**.

The winner of the community vote would receive $50 dollars in osu! store credit.

With that out of the way, let's get straight to the results:

Almost completely unanimously, the staff picked **[BilliumMoto](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3862471)**'s exceptional entry to take home the "grand" prize. We were thoroughly impressed with the scope and execution of his remix from a variety of standpoints, with his track positioning itself far above the rest from the very start.

Additionally, BilliumMoto's track also won the community vote, snatching a whopping 2277 votes!

However, to spread the glory around a bit, we've decided to crown the second-most chosen entry from the community vote as the winner for the community prize as well. **[Sayaka-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Sayaka-)**'s entry was a strong contender for first place from the moment the polls began.

<br/>

We'd also like to give an honorable mention to the third place entry from the community vote, created by **[happy30](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/happy30)**. happy30 has been with us for a long time and is well established as a mapper on his own merit, and it is truly something special to see him producing more excellent original content for osu! - albeit in an entirely different domain!

We'd also like to thank all those who entered the contest - creative endeavors are difficult at the best of times, especially so when competing against other people! osu!'s community has some amazingly creative people in its midst, and we absolutely love it when people come out with such incredible stuff.

Keep your eyes peeled for more contests like this in the future - we've got a bunch planned!
