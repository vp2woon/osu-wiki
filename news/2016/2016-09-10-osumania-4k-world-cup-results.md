Going into the Grand Finals, the South Korean team came hot off the heels of a rematch between defending champions United States. The confident South Korean team completely annihilated the competition and prepared themselves to meet whoever was coming from the loser's brackets.

The Brazilian team faced a much larger hurdle to reach the Grand Finals. Having been previously defeated by the United States team, it was clear that adjustments needed to be made if they wanted to make it into the Grand Finals. Having swept the Japanese team earlier, the Brazilians carried forth their momentum into the much anticipated rematch and convincingly defeated the American team to earn the right to face Korea in the Grand Finals.

Even though Brazil's appearance in the Grand Finals can be considered a success story in itself, it was clear from the beginning of the match who had the upper hand. Despite Brazil giving a by no means poor performance, team Korea hit the scene like a storm, absolutely wiping the floor with the finals map pool accumulating an average accuracy of 99.25%. When the dust cleared and the clouds scattered, team South Korea emerged victorious with a final score of 7-0.

Without further ado, I present to you the champions of the 2016 osu!mania 4K World Cup!
