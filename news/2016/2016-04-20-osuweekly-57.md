The stage has been set for a battle between bitter rivals in the Grand Finals of the osu!taiko world cup 2016! Some new (previously teased) graphics have made their way into the game, and new beatmap packs have been uploaded. Want to know more? Read on!

**Did you hear that? That was the sound of the new achievement graphics making their way into the game!** Prior to this update, achievement graphics were a static image below the results screen and have been largely missed. With the last time achievements being updated a distant memory, it is definitely a fresh and satisfying feeling to have your accomplishments bounce out in front of you!

**[fb39ca4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/fb39ca4) made a [cool video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix4bTQVZE-c) showing off osu! input using a laser pointer!** At first glance, it might seem like a normal pen tablet, and indeed, you can hold it just as you would a stylus. This is the first time I've seen something like this, but players have been creative with how they have played this game for a very long time.

**[Rhythm game packs volumes 1 through 4](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/packlist?t=t) have been uploaded!** After ducking out for a good month and a half, Stefan is back with us for more bundled beatmap goodness. These beatmap packs feature new and old tracks from various popular rhythm games. Being a multi-disciplinary of the genre myself, it's great to see a lot of the maps that made this list!

As usual, we have more amazing plays from around the community coming from -KousakaHonoka-:

- [Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Cookiezi) went and proved his infallible consistency by scoring a Hidden [full combo](https://puu.sh/ooOi9/d3791f6314.jpg) on [Kite](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Kite)'s [Imperial Circus Dead Decadence - Uta [Himei]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/410162). With the entire map spanning a knee-buckling 8 minutes and 47 seconds, it's no wonder that he's the only person who has been able to do this so far!
- [\_yu68](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/_yu68) closed out a new [DoubleTime full combo](https://puu.sh/ooYug/9cfa6d8587.jpg) on [qoot8123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/qoot8123)'s [DJ TOTTO vs TOTTO - Vajra [Inner Oni]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/322526).
- [\_Quit\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/_Quit_) was just [410 points away](https://puu.sh/op66W/a54ea617f6.jpg) from a 1 million record in [\[ A v a l o n \]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/%5B%20A%20v%20a%20l%20o%20n%20%5D)'s [ginkiha - Anemoi \[Daybreak\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/381397).

**It would seem that old rivalries are being rekindled in the Finals!** Team South Korea, who had previously lost to team Hong Kong in 2015, snatched victory from the jaws of defeat on the very last stream of the tiebreaker. They would go on to play Taiwan for a chance at facing the loser of the Winner's Finals.

The Winner's Finals match was the story of the underdogs from Team Canada, coming a long way in the winner's bracket to face the giant of a team that is Japan. Despite managing to take two points, their ability was not enough to secure them a place in the Grand Finals. They would later lose to Taiwan in the lower brackets (again playing a tiebreaker!).

**The Grand Finals is set to be between teams Japan and Taiwan.** This will mark the third time these two teams have met in a Finals situation, with Taiwan winning in 2011 and Japan winning 2015. Will Japan double up on their lead on their adversary? Or will Taiwan rise up to reclaim their throne? Join us at 9AM utc this sunday to find out!
