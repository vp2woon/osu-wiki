Thousands of people voted on their favorite beatmaps from 2018, but there can only be one winner! Let's get right into it:

### osu!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-02-04-community-choice-2018-results/kda2.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/874948)

**2489** voters could feel the rush now as they enjoyed [Nathan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4785223)'s take on the video-game cross K-pop masterpiece that took the world by storm, **[K/DA - POP/STARS (ft. Madison Beer, (G)I-DLE, Jaira Burns)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/874948)**!

This will likely come as a surprise to some who expected one map from the ubiquitous deluge of "farm" maps to nab top place, but as this goes to show, sometimes you just need to stop farming creeps and get out there and start nabbing kills, something that Nathan and his collaborators managed with effortless ease.

The finalists were:

- [Panda Eyes - ILY by M a r v o l l o](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/653534) with **1935** votes total.
- [Vickeblanka - Black Rover (TV Size) by Sotarks](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/781509) with **1911** votes total.

- [YUC'e - Future Candy by Nathan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/546820) with **1388** votes total.

### osu!taiko

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-02-04-community-choice-2018-results/xinobikill.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/742966)

**121** drum fanatics stepped forward and said "hell yes" to **[SOUND HOLIC feat. Nana Takahashi - XINOBIKILL](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/742966)** by [Skull Kid](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3044264), in some of the closest voting we've ever observed in a Community Choice poll *or* a "Best Of" to date.

Seriously, at some points, there were less than 3 votes splitting first, second, and third place. When we tweeted about the votes drawing to a close, there was a two-way tie for first place for at least a day before the votes were slated to close.

Crazy stuff. Congratulations!

The finalists were:

- [Porno Graffiti - The Day feat. Aruvn (dj-Jo Remix) Extended Version by Chromoxx](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/693174) with **104** votes total.
- [t+pazolite - Ultrasonic Anthem (Kobaryo's FTN-Remix) by tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/646093) with **94** votes total.
- [Unknown Artist - Miniministop Hitoyasumi no Uta\[Mokuyoubi\]Gakusei no Uta by Chromoxx](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/705423) with **74** votes total.
- [Vickeblanka - Black Rover (TV Size) by Sotarks](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/781509) with **72** votes total.
- [ESTi - HELIX (Edit ver.) by hikikochan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/625729) with **71** votes total.
- [ClariS - SHIORI vs. Hitorigoto by Sotarks](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/707380) with **67** votes total.
- [XXXTENTACION - Jocelyn Flores by Chromoxx](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/705133) with **66** votes total.
- [Will Stetson - Harumachi Clover (Swing Arrangement) [Dictate Edit] by Sotarks](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/842412) with **63** votes total.
- [KASAI HARCORES - Cycle Hit by Axer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/668239) with **63** votes total.

### osu!catch

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-02-04-community-choice-2018-results/asphyxia.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/758101)

With **182** votes, the collaborative sets by [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883), [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598) and [Hareimu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4138746) on **[Co shu Nie - asphyxia (TV edit)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/758101)** hosted by [Monstrata](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2706438) strangled out the competition solidly with a nearly 50 point lead.

Similar to osu!taiko, the voting for osu!catch was a super close endeavour all up until the last three or four days of voting, when asphyxia surged forward with a lead that the other sets could just not recover from.

The agonizing choice many osu!catch players were forced to make is super obvious in the sheer vote gap between many of the finalist entries, shown purely in the fact that 2nd and 3rd place are literally one vote apart.

Yowza.

The finalists were:

- [CustomiZ - COOLEST by Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/502512) with **139** votes total.
- [Camellia - Ultimate Ascension by Deif](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/520301) with **138** votes total.
- [Chito (CV: Minase Inori), Yuuri (CV: Kubo Yurika) - More One Night (Assertive Hardcore Bootleg) \[short ver.\] by Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/781081) with **136** votes total.
- [Icon For Hire - Make a Move (Speed Up Ver.) by Sotarks](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/765778) with **134** votes total.
- [LeaF - Alice in Misanthrope -Ensei Alice- by Deif](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/797236) with **113** votes total.
- [Function Phantom - Algebra by Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/468281) with **107** votes total.
- [dj TAKA - quaver by Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/879085) with **102** votes total.
- [LiSA - ADAMAS (TV Size) by Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/867287) with **100** votes total.
- [Zektbach - Turii \~Panta rhei\~ by Kyuare](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/685428) with **99** votes total.

**621** voters saw reason to celebrate **[MAZARE - Mazare Party](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/650415)** by [Insp1r3](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7131254) with a positively dominating lead over its competition, leading the pack by nearly a solid third of the next highest finalist.
