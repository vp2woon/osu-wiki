It's that time of the year again. The OWC 2019 is on the horizon and registrations are now open! The 10th installment and thus also our 10th anniversary of the OWC is community driven and focused as never before! There will be some big changes, as this year's OWC was preceded by a discussion and feedback phase which involved players from the previous OWC.

A Qualifier Stage will be awaiting the players at first instead of a Group Stage. This Qualifier Stage is not limited to only 32 teams though! Weaker teams will be able to have a shot at qualifying through their own performance to claim a spot in the Main Bracket Stage. Unfortunately this means there are no insane Group Stage upsets or very early ruined Pick'ems this time around, but will hopefully come to fruition with the best teams facing in very close matches at the later stages of the tournament! Afterwards, a Round of 32 Stage will feature the 32 best performing teams, which then is followed by the usual bracket structure.

The hugely popular proposed rule change of failed scores counting has now been implemented. Every player is free to use NoFail in addition to other mods in all picks without any score reduction.

Next to the previously mentioned rule changes there are some smaller clarifications in very specific situations, a slight change in the FreeMod Bracket, altered ban rules and much more!

These are just some of the changes for this year. For more details, refer to the **[osu! World Cup 2019 wiki article](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2019)**.
You can discuss this event and follow the most important changes in the **[official discussion thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/973724)**.

## How do I register?

- **[Click here to sign-up!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/22)**
- Do not create teams in advance! Teams will be formed by the country's team captain after the registration phase is concluded.
- Hand in your registration before the **27th of October.**

Please note that you may only participate if you are of a **osu! global ranking of #5000 or higher and have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months**.

If your registration successfully passes our evaluation, you will be put on the candidate list for your country. Whenever a captain for your country is assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

_Remember that any registrations past the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances - so get your registrations done early to avoid any last-minute issues._
