Bursting onto the scene with the sounds of digital punk, **HyuN** joins the fray as osu!'s newest Featured Artist!

Showcasing some of the rhythm gaming scene's freshest talent, we're proud to welcome **HyuN** as the latest addition to the Featured Artist project, with **24** brand new tracks to choose from, complete with the Mappers' Guild's biggest ever beatmap pack release!

Sporting a more classical sound reminiscent of the earlier days of rhythm gaming, **HyuN** is by no means outdated, building on the time-tested framework of frantic speed, constantly evolving rhythms and broad melodic progression with a fresh new take from a variety of genres, all neatly bundled up into little bite-size pieces.

Absolutely *perfect* for mapping, as the size of the new beatmap pack below can attest:

All of these tracks and **MUCH MORE** are available over at [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/33) - go check them out!

As with all Featured Artist tracks, the works on **HyuN**'s listing are 100% free for use in mapping and modding, and come with a pre-timed base to help you get started.

We'd also like to take a moment to share that this release will herald the end of the *exclusive* launch-accompanying beatmap releases from the Mappers' Guild, at least for now.

The Guild's not going anywhere however, and we have a new system in the works to help encourage mapping circles (har har) of all kinds to get involved with the amazing work of our superbly talented Featured Artists.

We're excited to hear your creative take on **HyuN**'s work! And as always, keep your eyes and ears peeled for more on the Featured Artist project!
