Back in September, we challenged our great mapping community to create a thorougly fruity difficulty spread to the entrancing tune of [Thaehan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/7) - Yuujou. Ten mappers stepped up to the plate, showcasing their abilities for a chance to join the coveted ranks of osu!'s *Elite Mappers*. The results can be seen below:

| Rank | Username | Entry Name | Musical Relevance (30) | Creativity (30) | Technique (30) | Impression (30) | Hitsounding (15) | Difficulty Spread (15) | Total Score |

| \#1 | Sinnoh | Zealous Beaver | 27.5 | 26.5 | 26 | 29 | 13 | 13 | **135** |
| \#2 | Minato Yukina | Esteemed Dragon | 27 | 24 | 24 | 26 | 12 | 13 | **126** |

Securing **first place** for the inaugural osu!catch Mapping Olympiad is [**Sinnoh**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4236057) with a total score of **135**! Sinnoh's entry blew away the competition, securing the highest aggregate scores in Musical Relevance, Creativity and Technique, and also garnered a perfect score from two of the three judges' in the Impression category.

A strong **second place** is awarded to [**Minato Yukina**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/531253) with a total score of **126**! Minato Yukina's entry tied with Sinnoh's for the best Difficulty Spread, and whilst not placing first in any particular category, put in a strong performance across the board to secure a respectably high finish from the veteran.

Rounding out the podium in **third place** is [**Ascendance**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) with a total score of **117.5**! Though he could not repeat his feats from 2017's osu!catch Beatmapping Contest, receiving the highest score for hitsounding and solid marks across all other categories helped the most recent *Elite Mapper* in osu!catch edge ahead of fierce competition.
