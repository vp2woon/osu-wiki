**MYLK** joins the lineup as the last Featured Artist of 2019!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/62/header.jpg)

The end of the year is well and truly here and with it, our last addition to the roster for the decade. It's been a wild year of amping up the pace, and what better note to leave it on than the bubblegum blast that is **MYLK**!

**MYLK**'s featured in a bunch of collaborative works across the EDM scene as a vocalist, working alongside artists like *Muzzy*, *Feint*, and *Moe Shop*.

She's also an avid producer in her own right with a whopping assortment of singles and tracks, and we're delighted to announce that we have **15** brand new tracks from her ensemble for you to embrace, all guaranteed to be extremely high in calcium, sugar, and punchy EDM pop that wriggles into your earholes and refuses to leave.

In a bit of a throwback to some of our earlier releases, the osu!taiko wing of the [Mappers' Guild](https://mappersguild.com/) has been hard at work creating a bunch of new sets to some of her tracks to help you end the year with a bang — literally.

They're included in the preview bits below, so make sure to give them a look:

As always, all of the above plus so much more is available right now from [**MYLK**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/62), pre-timed by the most pishi of fats and all primed and ready for you to work your mapping magic with.

Congratulations to [fieryrage](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3533958) for correctly deciphering the hint we posted yesterday on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame), which aligns with our written expectations of each Beatmap Nominator to contain one whole galaxy within each of their brains.

In all seriousness, the Featured Artist project has really taken off this year, and we're well on our way towards the mythical and completely arbitrary milestone of 100 artists by the end of 2020. Major props to [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) and [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689), who have been busting their proverbial nuts in a never-ending effort to keep the outreach and uptake wheels greased and moving at lightspeed.

We'll see you next week for another release, and make sure to check the Twitter mid-week for hints, if that's your kinda thing.
