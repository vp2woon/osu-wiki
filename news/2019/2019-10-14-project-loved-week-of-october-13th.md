[KNOWER - Overtime (Live Band Session)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1020600#osu) by [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)\
145 BPM, 4:35 | 7.15★, 7.98★

KNOWER is steadily becoming a household name in the osu! world, and for good reason—they have some *great* songs. Great songs deserve great maps, and that's exactly what Mismagius has for us here. This creative 8-star map captures the song in a unique, technical style. The map is filled with one-of-a-kind alternating patterns making it perfect for those of you looking for a new challenge. A nerfed version of the main difficulty is also available for those of you still asking, "what's the tempo?"

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-10-14-project-loved-week-of-october-13th/osu/2-jinsei-wa-yume-darake.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/973352)

[Shiina Ringo - Jinsei wa Yume Darake](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/934179#osu) by [melloe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2367616)\
100 BPM, 3:13 | 5.80★

Most maps make you feel like you're playing to the beat of the song, but has a map ever made you feel like you're *playing* the song? If you don't know what I'm talking about, try playing this map. You'll see what I mean. melloe has put together such a masterpiece that it would be an insult to attempt putting it into words. The map is around six stars, but it's not like any other map you'll play. All I can say is that if you like maps that leave you with uniquely satisfying experiences, you'll love this map.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-10-14-project-loved-week-of-october-13th/osu/3-mesen.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/973351)

[BUTAOTOME - Mesen](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/865750#osu) by [BarkingMadDog](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3475189)\
230 BPM, 3:17 | 7.31★

Hey, you like to jump, right? Great, because BarkingMadDog has yet another masterpiece of a jump map for us all to enjoy. This 230 BPM map is filled with satisfying 7-star jump patterns throughout most of the song's 3-minute duration. Topped off with a catchy BUTAOTOME song, this is the perfect map for all you aim enthusiasts out there.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-10-14-project-loved-week-of-october-13th/osu/4-nounai-kakumei-girl.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/973350)

[Reol, ill.bell - Nounai Kakumei Girl](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/588397#osu) by [Kaifin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596942)\
240 BPM, 3:37 | 6.09★

This map is the definition of a well-executed gimmick. It's filled with overlapping sliders and cut 1/3 streams that are made in a way that play really well. The song lends itself well to the patterns in the map, making it super satisfying to play. It's the perfect map for putting your finger control to the test in a way most maps can't challenge. Sound appealing to you? Try the map for yourself! It's certainly one for the collections.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-10-14-project-loved-week-of-october-13th/osu/5-altar.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/973349)

[That Poppy - Altar](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/685822#osu) by [-NeBu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4099626)\
132 BPM, 2:39 | 9.75★

Sharpen your high BPM aim, because you're going to need it to be in tip-top shape for this 264 BPM jump map. This high 9-star map has 3 distinct kiai sections with jumps that get harder each time. No streams in sight here, just the high-spacing jumps you'd expect out of a map with such a high star rating. Even if aim is your strong suit, all I can say is "good luck".

[UNDERVEIL ALLSTARS - UNDERVEIL IS REAL!!! ...AND WE ARE UNDERVEIL!!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/769661#taiko) by [Noko_BSF](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3811831) et al.\
180 BPM, 5:45 | 5.59★\
*description written by [nyanmi-1828](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6866480)*

Coming to Loved this week is a huge collab hosted by Noko_BSF, with 22 mappers covering 24 parts of this song. The map showcases all of their different styles, some having more typical patterns, others featuring difficult rhythm, and even one part with crazy SVs. It's a 6-minute marathon, but the various styles are so interesting that it goes by in no time. Try it out yourself!

総勢22人が24パートを担当した、Noko_BSF主催の超大型コラボマップが今週のLovedに登場です！（22人の内2人は2パートを担当しています。）この譜面は標準的なパターンが組まれたパートからリズムが難しいパート、多彩なSVが入れられたパートなど、様々なマッパーの個性が集まった譜面です。6分のマラソン譜面ではありますが、24の個性が集まったこの曲、そしてこの譜面に、最後まで飽きることなくプレイできるでしょう！

[Rahatt - Mariquita Breakcore](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/933247#taiko) by [7_7](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7491106)\
220 BPM, 2:52 | 9.22★\
*description written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

*Mariquita Breakcore* by 7_7 is, to put it short, insanity materialized. With an extreme amount of 1/6+1/4 patterns, 1/8 doublets, and a respectable 220 BPM, this map is as hard as it gets for maps that are still manageable to full combo. While we expect the usual gods to eat this map like breakfast, we would love to see scores from other top players that look to show off their skills in a big manner. Enjoy!!

[Panda Eyes & Teminite - Highscore](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/615326#fruits) by [Minato Yukina](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/531253) et al.\
110 BPM, 4:18 | 1.72★, 4.68★, 6.23★, 6.39★\
*description written by [Wesley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2407265)*

Minato Yukina is by no means a new face to the Loved section already boasting a whopping 12 maps in the category. This map is one of the many Nervous Breakdowns' he has created. As the name suggests it is quite heavy on the nerves due to the constant jumps combined with hyperchains. To top it all off, the Nervous Breakdown difficulty has some unique hitsounding from various other games. While Nervous Breakdown is probably the most known difficulty, it isn't the only difficulty in the set. [Milquar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5878453), [Yumeno Himiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1806962) and [ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) have created some well-made difficulties too. All three difficulties offer a wide variation in overall difficulty and patterns, whether it be the Salad, Rain or Overdose. Even though it isn't a full spread, the set will be playable in one way or another for almost everyone!

[Infected Mushroom - The Pretender](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/905769#fruits) by [Fauzan 2000](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9317817)\
174 BPM, 6:26 | 6.92★\
*description written by [Sartan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4100941)*

Whereas the other selected osu!catch map for this week's Loved round is from a mapper with quite some prestige both Loved and Ranked wise, I'd like to introduce you to someone that hasn't seen any kind of love lovin' as of yet! Enter Fauzan 2000, an Indonesian mapper that has been very steadily improving throughout 2019. He has made some very fun maps in this period, such as *The Pretender*. The map itself is very straightforward in its style, being fairly jump heavy throughout with some jump streams in the solo. It does make for a very comfortable and enjoyable experience, with high end players being able to really let loose with hidden and/or hardrock turned on. So do give this more obscure map a spin, as I'm sure most of you will definitely enjoy it!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-10-14-project-loved-week-of-october-13th/mania/1-poetic-justice-away.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/973341)

[PLINI X KENDRICK LAMAR - POETIC JUSTICE // AWAY](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/955714#mania) by [Razzy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7690361)\
140 BPM, 2:37 | \[4K\] 4.66★

You might remember Razzy's opening gambit in Loved, [Groundhog](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/591171)—a wonderfully simple, but effective SV chart—and now she returns to Loved with a more complex, but just as effective Long Note chart in *POETIC JUSTICE // AWAY*. The chart is an LN experience that encapsulates such a large range of patterns including mini-LN streams, effective minijack and technical transitions, three-column inverse as well as full inverse, difficult but satisfying release patterns, and almost anything else you can think of. Each of these LN elements is impressively tied to distinct sounds and sections of the chart, all being logical and matching very well from a player's perspective.

All of this charted to a surprisingly rare (given its popularity outside of osu!) music genre in hip hop/rap. *POETIC JUSTICE // AWAY* proves to be a unique, satisfying, and extremely effective long note chart that more than deserves its past use in high-end tournaments and now its nomination for the osu!mania Loved section.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-10-14-project-loved-week-of-october-13th/mania/2-eighto.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/973340)

[Jomekka - Eighto](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/584698#mania) by [Wh1teh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2640467)\
234 BPM, 3:26 | \[4K\] 5.48★

Wh1teh gets another chart nominated into the Loved section with his rendition of Jomekka's *Eighto*. To call the chart relentless is an understatement—Eighto has nonstop 1/6 bursts at 234 BPM (351 BPM 1/4s) with occasional doubles, 1/4 split jumptrills, and many extended 1/6 light jumpstreams sandwiched in its fairly short 3 minute lifespan. The first 2 minutes practically has no break, so you'll most likely find yourself running on fumes by the time you reach the longer jumpstreams in the chart.

This chart is fairly popular among high-level players, and for good reason. It's straight-forward, it's fast, it's comfortable to play through, and the song is remarkably catchy. Even the split jumptrills in the chart, which under normal circumstances would be very rigid to play through, feel like slicing through butter. The bursts and streams in the chart fit the song extremely well, and it's not hard to see why this chart is highly praised among the high-level playing community.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-10-14-project-loved-week-of-october-13th/mania/3-kawaki-wo-ameku.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/973339)

[Minami - Kawaki wo Ameku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/919643#mania) by [Flexo123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5367287)\
136 BPM, 4:09 | \[7K\] 10.78★

Starting off with with K-pop and into something Choir-y, Flexo123 comes back to Project Loved with another O2-style chart with a J-rock track. Inversions and dense 1/4 LN chordstreams with varying lengths are commonplace in this map and it's definitely not a cakewalk to go through these patterns clocking in at a seemingly tame BPM of 129. As the chart progresses, hints of what is yet to come are presented with increasingly rigid chordstreams and inclusion of 1/8 LN dumps. A fair amount of breaks are presented between main section to work as breathers but even those get progressively harder which ends things at a staggering section with tons of 1/8 LN inversions which at times goes to be double staircases mixed into longer LNs. A fair challenge for anyone wanting to test their LN reading and inverse streaming skills.
