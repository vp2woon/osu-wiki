Coming straight at you from 2004, [**Disko Warp**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/44) blasts into the Featured Artist lineup!

Made popular by the [Radio Gosha animated shorts from 2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Na1A6lSHns), the masterminds over at [**Disko Warp**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/44) are our latest entry into the rapidly growing catalogue of superbly talented artists and labels.

Built on the very foundations of rhythm gaming sound, anyone who's played just about any other early rhythm game outside of osu! will at once be familiar with many of the artists and sounds now available via [their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/44).

We've managed to snag a selection of **32** tracks for ravenous mappers to sink their sweet-tooth into, including a large selection from **Disko Warp**'s highly popular *Hardcore Advance* albums.

Check out a little sample of what's available below:
