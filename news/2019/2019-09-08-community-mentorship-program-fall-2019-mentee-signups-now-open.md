The next cycle of the Community Mentorship program is starting again! If you've ever found yourself wanting to get into beatmapping or expand your current knowledge and skills, this program will serve as a great opportunity for you!

The Community Mentorship program serves as place for upcoming mappers and modders to develop their skills underneath the guidance of more experienced mappers and modders in the community. Over the course of a cycle, you'll have the opportunity to learn from your mentor, participate in various mentorship events (such as mapping contests), hang out with fellow mentees, and more!

For those of you already experienced in mapping, and have a desire to take those that are newer under your wing, we also support mentor applications! In the [forum announcement and rule thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/955356), you'll be able to apply if you're considering mentoring! Keep in mind mentor applications are currently closed, but we will be opening up for future cycles, so please be patient.

For this upcoming fall cycle, we are looking for both mentors and mentees for all game modes!

Since last cycle, we've restructured our general mentorship timeline:

- Mentors are no longer required to sign up each cycle; instead, a mentor may stay for as long as they'd like, and can retire at any time once completing their commitments to their mentees or by passing their mentees to other mentors.
- Mentee applications are processed every 4 weeks, and expire after 8 if they have not been accepted. However, applicants with high interest in the program are encouraged to reapply as often as possible to better reflect their interest, changes in mentor preferences, and availability.
- Mentors and mentees are fixed for a minimum of 8 weeks, but mentors can hold mentees for longer than this and are encouraged to do so.

---

For this following cycle, the timeline is as follows (all opening and closing dates start and end at midnight UTC+0):

- Mentor sign-ups opened on 2019-09-01 and closed on 2019-09-08.
- Mentee sign-ups will open on 2019-09-22 and close on 2019-10-03.
- The fall 2019 cycle will run from 2019-10-06 to 2020-01-05.

Throughout this active cycle time, the organization team will host various events on the Mentorship discord server, engaging and offering events for mentees and mentors to participate in. These include feedback lobbies, mapping contests, and more! Some of our previous puzzles can be found here at this [thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/565382), and previous discussions can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/514122).

If any of this interests you or anyone you know, please go to our [forum announcement and rules thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/955356) for more information!

We're looking forward to the future mappers of tomorrow!
