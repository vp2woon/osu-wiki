Splashing into osu! with its own brand of indie surf rock, [**Carpool Tunnel**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/42) joins the Featured Artist lineup!

[**Carpool Tunnel**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/42)'s music strays from the usual genres heard from osu!'s Featured Artists. Based at the center of the indie rock scene, San Francisco, the band showcases a classical/alternative rock sound with fervent vocal delivery in each song.

We're proud to present **11** tracks consisting of the group's *Getaway* EP and a variety of their single releases. No two songs are alike, so pick and choose whichever you find most enticing to beatmap from the [Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/42)!

Here's a few previews of what Carpool Tunnel has to offer:
