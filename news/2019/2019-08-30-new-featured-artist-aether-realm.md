Filling out their entry in the annals of osu!, [**Æther Realm**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/47) journeys towards the glory of the Featured Artist roster!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/47/header.jpg)

After the unprecedented popularity of the band's 19-minute epic [**The Sun, The Moon, The Star**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/933630#osu/1949106) mapped by [ItsWinter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6381153) and [Ghouru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6273855), **Æther Realm** has been a highly requested addition to the osu! Featured Artist family.

The band's powerful folk metal vocals and deep-rooted power and symphonic metal riffs leave little to be desired in setting the scene for an epic journey from start to end in every track.

Embark on the same trail that [**Æther Realm**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/47) has blazed as we proceed to offer you their **entire discography to date** for mapping within osu!.
