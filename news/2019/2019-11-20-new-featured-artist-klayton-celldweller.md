You heard it right, it's technically a three-for-one deal this week!

**24** new tracks from **3** musical aliases, sporting genres ranging from industrial rock to retro-electronic are now available for your mapping and modding adventures, all toting **Klayton**'s signature sound and vocals.

**Klayton** is something of a visionary when it comes to rock and its various forms, and we're super excited to see what you all do with this prime selection of some of his work.

But don't take my word for it, give the following tracks a listen and hear for yourselves:
