Heeey! I'm back! You won't believe the sorta stuff I've been up to but wow, is it just me or am I *fashionable* now? Come check me out!

It's me, Yuzu!

Yeah, I'm pretty sure most of you were wondering what happened to me since you guys dropped in suggestions on my *refashionising* project (yeah, yeah, I know this isn't a real word, but I'm *wayyy* too cool to care.).

Hold up a sec, lemme lock the doors first.

Okay, where was I? Yeah, "refashionising". Ah, I love it when they scream in pain every time I use that word. Here, lemme flip this mirror around so you can see how gorgeous I am:

I picked through all of the things people suggested (a wizard hat? really?) and decided to go with [Thievley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4717672)'s design because I felt you know... *connected* to her design. It screams... *speed*.

Okay, really, more like because she made me look pretty cool.

I'm sorry that it took a *VERY* long time to talk about this, but here I am. Better late than never. A lot of things happened recently. Cool things. Really. Oh man, you won't believe the stuff that went down. It was ace.

I choose to go with blue because I like blue. That's it. It's cool.

Oh, oh, but lemme tell you how I got my amazing scarf!

It starts with me accidentally dropping into a mysterious portal, which leads to some epic mecha fight (and flatten some medieval looking cities in the process, unfortunately), and the death of a friend that I recently met.

That was sad. But she had this really awesome scarf that she got from her grandfather - and now, it's mine! She gave it to me. I have proof. Really!

But pssh, I don't wanna bore you with all the details. Basically, I have this *cool looking scarf that floats.* **FOREVER.** And it makes me look **so VERY VERY COOL.**

Anyway, where was I?

Oh yeah, check out these cool side boosters that I obtained fr-- no. Wait, I made these. Yes. Look at these cool side boosters that I made. They give me the ability to dash super fast; pretty useful when belting it towards a train when it's about to close its doors. So cool.

Don't forget about the new disc too; it floats on my palm! Yeah, now I can catch falling things, in style. Oh, check 'em out - they even attach to my side boosters with MAGNETS! Nyoom! SO. DAMN. COOL.

I can't decide about my goggles though. Not sure if I look cool with them or not. Meh, I'll just follow my mood. Yeah, I'm cool that way.

Aren't I just the coolest?

Hmm? Is that someone banging on my door? Oh, welp, guess it's time for me to get outta h--
