Round two of Scorewatch! This time, we've got more scores, more videos and more hype to showcase more of the best from osu!'s top players in all modes. Check out the feats these guys have been pulling off!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-02-20-scorewatch-3-february-to-16-february/banner.jpg)

Scorewatch is settling back into a regular schedule, and it looks like we'll be able to run this for a while! That means you can check back here for bi-weekly updates on all the latest and greatest scores made in the game.

[We've opened a public form where you can submit scores that you'd like us to feature!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfOba_zdoybOizyZsvDB18Xu1RVVZEdTn560Ar2kZm4ph4Icw/viewform?usp=sf_link) We also put an option here where you can write a full description for it (which is shown below the score on this post), if you'd like to help us out ;). Speaking of helping out, if you're interested in any of finding scores, writing about scores, or recording video replays, make sure to [join the osu!monthly Discord server](https://discord.gg/wGV4qzR) where the Scorewatch project is currently being hosted.

This week, there are *a lot* more osu!standard scores than scores for other modes. That's expected, and we are currently looking into the possibility of making off-week posts specific to osu!standard, but with limited manpower it's a bit difficult to make that happen. So no promises.

Anyway, that's enough talk, let's take a look at what's been happening in the score scene these past weeks!

This round of Scorewatch starts off with a speedy play from Rafis! Holding impressive accuracy on even the most difficult bursty parts of this map, he manages to not only avoid misses but also hit most of the sliderends where all the odds are against him. Check out the live recording!

*Added and written by [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350)*

idke holds an impressive combo on this 9-star map! It's right down his alley, with long, spaced streams and extra difficulty from length. This is what happens when you perfect a playstyle!

*Added and written by [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350)*

You've heard of this map before; now it's Freddie Benson's turn to get the FC! Following in the steps of the older Remote Control mapset, this one's got jumps everywhere with the new challenge of length added to it. That doesn't stop Freddie from making a clean score on it, though!

**[WubWoofWolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/39828)**: [Hatsune Miku no Tomadoi [Hard]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/15320#osu/55537) +HD,NC **Silver SS**\
4 February 2019, Ranked, 244pp\
*Added and written by [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350)*

An SS?! WubWoofWolf shows us yet again that he's one of the kings on older maps. This map has some crazy stream shapes, awkward rhythm and a challenging AR/OD combo, but WubWoofWolf doesn't break a sweat with this #1 play.

Bubbleman earns his place on the leaderboard of this legendary map with an equally legendary HD,HR play. You already know what makes this play special, so check out the video of the replay if you want to see it in action!

*Added and written by [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350)*

You know it's going to be good when it's a Cookiezi snipe: Umbre takes the #1 spot on ktgster's guest difficulty of Blue Zenith, holding marvelous accuracy even through the bombardment of streams that this map throws.

7 February 2019, Ranked, 728pp\
*Added and written by [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350)*

With small CS, spaced streams and aggressive drumming, idke's score here completes the story we were all waiting for. Unfortunately he sliderbroke near the end, but it's still a totally insane play given how the difficulty increases as this song progresses.

**[Gayzmcgee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1419095)**: [The Pretender [Ignorance]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/646289#osu/1391282) +DT **A** (1,267/2,390x, 98.87%)\
7 February 2019, Ranked, 500pp\
*Added and written by [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350)*

Gayzmcgee sought out to improve his old score on this map, and here's the result of his effort! That 500pp value should tell you how crazy this score is, considering that it's barely over half combo. You probably suspected this from seeing Gayz's name, but this score showcases speed on a whole other level compared to other players.

*Added and written by [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350)*

Setting the first HR FC, idke destroys this long and exhausting map. It's got streams everywhere, and they're not easy ones either: lots of direction and spacing changes make them quite a nightmare to execute correctly, especially all within the same play. idke does it anyway!

*Added and written by [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350)*

9-star FCs? Not a problem for FlyingTuna. He's capable of comboing just about any DT jump map thrown at him, and even going into the 9-star range, he apparently has no problems. Check this one out if you're a fan of his signature speedy aim!

Good ol' Xilver is back at it again with his stupidly accurate plays, and this time it's on a map known to test players for their long streaming ability. Earning almost an SS on a stream marathon with HR, this is an impressive feat of accuracy that very few have compared to.

*Added and written by [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350)*

Gayzmcgee takes on the newer of the Miraizu maps with DT here, and clears it with no issues. Worth almost 700pp even without HD, this is yet another display of his speed (mostly in aim for this one)!

*Added and written by [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350)*

Where there are jumps, there is FlyingTuna. This guy has been going absolutely crazy lately with his DT plays, and this is one of his best. Words can't really describe how this compares to the DT jump maps you're used to seeing, so check out the video!

**[Zestiny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1622830)**: [Snow Goose [Sharon's]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/21754#osu/75359) +DT **S** (337/726x, 94.44%)\

*Added and written by [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350)*

This score unfortunately didn't overwrite a previous one of Zestiny's, but it showcases their incredible ability to burst absurdly high BPM streams like they're nothing. Maybe we'll see this one improved!

*Added and written by [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350)*

Taking the first FC on this map, nathan on osu does so with HD as a bonus, and seemingly without even putting in a whole lot of effort. He's always a monster on maps with unconventional patterning like this, so it's no surprise that when given the opportunity he can shred it to pieces. Check out the video!

**[idke](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4650315)**: [Light it up [Brilliance]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/650738#osu/1378892) **S** (2,106/2,890x, 99.18%)\

idke shows us with this score that he can impress us with more than just HR streams; this map is packed with technical patterning that has so far prevented any FCs from showing on the board. Diversity reigns king!

FlyingTuna's quest for rank #1 global ended here. In good fieryrage mapping style, this score takes advantage of the massive jumps that only increase in spacing as the map goes on, which make for a nice juicy pp farm extravaganza. This isn't to be glossed over, though, it's really quite a feat to be able to hit those final patterns at all!

*Added and written by [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350)*

fieryrage earned the highest-rated mouse score in pp with this play, rather controversially on his own map. It's hard to deny the incredible aim required to score well on this map, though. With HR added on top, the end of this map turns into just about the most spaced jump section imaginable.

You can usually bet that it's a crazy score when nathan on osu sets the only FC on a map, and this one is no different. This fast-paced Left map features only circles and challenges players with its streams that constantly change spacing and direction. Getting nearly an SS with Hidden, nathan on osu shows here his incredible aim and tapping control.

*Added and written by [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350)*

I didn't expect to see an FC on this so soon! If you're unfamiliar with the map, it's full of spaced and cut streams, as well as demanding slider velocities that test even the best players' abilities when it comes to aiming these things. ThePooN managed to make it through the crazy ending of this rrtyui/Sing collab, and earned his placement well.

Somebody thought idke couldn't FC this, so the madman went and got the SS. If you thought idke was all about streams, think again: this map's ending is absolutely packed with the most cross-screen jumps possible, and idke hits them all without breaking a sweat.

FlyingTuna surprised us all with the second (almost-) FC on AXION_REBORN! While more popularly known for his high-star DT plays, here he proves his versatility and diversity in skill, setting an S-rank on one of the most difficult ranked maps in the game. Check out the video if you've never played this map!

*Added and written by [JDrago14](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7690078)*

Despite that this map has only been Loved for a little over a week now, this is actually quite an old map, and a difficult one at that. It comes with technical patterns and some complex streams that are sure to throw some players off. However, Ulqui prevails and manages to shine through by scoring one of the only few HD FCs on the map while attaining high accuracy as well, cementing its place here.

**[Ppus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5918857)**: [Tanoshii Yoru no Ochakai - Ringo's Tea Party [kata's-M CorpseParty]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/468400#taiko/1001887) +HD **Silver S** (FC, 99.64%)\
3 February 2019, Loved\
*Added and written by [JDrago14](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7690078)*

Ppus' play on this map highlights just how impressive it really is. As this map has a ton of SV Gimmicks that'll make even the best sightreaders struggle to play this well. Not to mention with Hidden, there is less room to read any patterns.

**[isobe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8047347)**: [Songs Compilation [Kin's Inner Oni]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/736560#taiko/1558698) +HD,DT **Silver S** (FC, 98.63%)\

*Added and written by [JDrago14](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7690078)*

This is another map that is actually very long and intense, clocking in at speeds of up to 276 BPM with streams that are sure enough to exhaust a lot of players that attempt this map. But isobe demonstrates just how well he is able to read and play the map by scoring the very first HD,DT FC on the leaderboards with a solid 98.63% accuracy; a feat that not many have achieved to this day.

**[shinchikuhome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3174184)**: [World's End, Girl's Rondo (Asterisk DnB Remix) [KTYN's Worlds End]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/445730#taiko/1763967) +DT,HR **S** (FC, 99.85%)\

*Added and written by [JDrago14](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7690078)*

As always, shinchikuhome has been able to amaze us time and time again with his impressive versatility of mod usage and sightreading skills. And this map of course is no exception as he scores a nearly perfect play with the DT,HR mod combo. This is certaintly one score that'll be unrivaled by many other players which makes it all the more deserving to have a place here.

ekr is back at it again with the low acc HD,DT FCs, but then again, it is quite understandable on this map. It may only be on the "Rain" difficulty, but it still requires amazing DT control to be able to get an FC on it, and it also shows by the fact that there is not a single HD,HR FC on it that this is definitely an impressive play.

Abstract- shows that putting HD,DT on AR9 isn't the only thing he's good at, as he has set an extremely impressive score on this recent tech map. This map features some stacks that are way too easy to miss on, and Abstract goes and hits them all, to finish on tragic misses, compared to what he got earlier, since the ending is still hard to get!

Dusk has came and pulled out an impressive HD FC on this new 9-star map, which got ranked 6 days ago, and he managed to set the score barely 10 hours after it got ranked! This is even more impressive considering that good players at HD on specifics like Rocma and Vinci007 have not been able to get even close to an FC on this map.

Karym has taken the fourth ever HR FC on Asymmetry, along with monsters like Dusk, Sousaki, and Touch Me. After nearly 4 years of the map being ranked, seeing only 4 HR FCs on it is not that surprising considering the difficulty of the patterns of this map.

Hyper being Hyper as always. This is the only thing that can possibly be said for this play. This is way too ridiculous on too many levels. This map already has an awful lot of anti-flow patterns which make it horrible to fc it with nomod, only there being one HD FC, and Hyper has came out of basically nowhere and FC's it with HR.

wonder5193 has pulled off an absolute beast-like score by getting an FC on nearly the entire map, and ends up missing only the troll part at the end. This kind of scores by wonder are just ridiculous. The leaderboard does not have many FCs, and he almost FCs it all, beating the next best combo, which is held by SillyFangirl, by over 1,800 combo! A score like this deserves praise.

AscensionDTWhen? Now. After months of trying, jakads has FINALLY gotten an S rank with the DT mod on Ascension To Heaven, and on top of that, he beat jhlee's accuracy, which was nowhere near being beaten within two years, by 0.50%. Way too impressive for its own good.

jakads has broken the pp record! On his own map too. This is starting to get old isn't it? But with that, he gets the first ever 1100pp play in mania, right on the dot!

That's a wrap on this round of Scorewatch! Stay tuned for future updates!
