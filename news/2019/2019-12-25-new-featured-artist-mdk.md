**MDK** blasts on in as our latest addition to the Featured Artist lineup!

Continuing a growing trend of incorporating superbly talented artists featured elsewhere in the rhythm gaming community (especially from *Geometry Dash* for those keeping track), we're proud to welcome **MDK** aboard officially!

You may be familiar with his biggest hit, *Press Start*, which has accumulated nearly 20 million views on his YouTube channel alone since 2015. Beyond that, he's had his work featured in games like *Need for Speed: Payback* and of course, *Geometry Dash*.

Fans of his aptly described *wubstep* will find themselves delighted to know that a selection of **17** works is now available for their mapping masterpieces in the making.

Check out a few examples below:

All of the above and so much more are available now over at [**MDK**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/61), pre-timed as usual and 100% ready for your creative magnificence.

There might not've been a hint for this one due to the crush surrounding the osu! World Cup 2019 Grand Finals and the onset of Christmas being a thing, but we'll absolutely have another scorching new Featured Artist lined up for you before the end of the year, plus an extra spicy hint to boot. No, these aren't hints, you'll need to keep an eye on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for those.

As a brief aside, from all of us on the osu!team, we wish you all a very merry Christmas, and a happy new year.

Enjoy, and see you next week!
