Do you want to get into beatmapping for this game, but have no clue where to start? In that case, the Community Mentorship program might be the way to begin your mapping career!

**Big changes are being made to the program! If you don’t want to miss them, read this post in detail.**

This program serves as a platform for new mappers and modders to get into the beatmapping process more quickly. They'll be teaming up with more experienced mappers and modders in the community that will show them the ropes for a total of eight or more weeks.

Mentor applications are already open, so head on over to the [forum announcement and rule thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/894182) if you’re considering mentoring! Mentor applications take some time to process, so there will be a few weeks before mentee applications are open.

For the upcoming summer cycle, we are looking for both mentors and mentees for all game modes!

In addition, we are restructuring the Mentorship Program schedule! Listed below is an overview of the changes most impactful to our mentors and mentees:

- **Mentors no longer need to sign back up every cycle.** All mentors sign up for their position indefinitely, but can end their tenure at any time after completing their commitments to their mentees or passing them to another mentor.
- **Mentors and mentees are bound for a minimum 8 weeks.** This is down from the previous duration of one cycle (approx. 12 weeks), but mentors can also hold mentees for longer than this, and are encouraged to do so.
- **You can apply for mentee once per 4-week phase.** Any applications more than 2 phases old will no longer be considered. However, any applicant with continued interest is encouraged to reapply every phase to reflect any updated mentor choices and scheduling availability.

The timeline is as follows (all opening and closing dates start and end at midnight UTC+0):

- Mentor signups started on 2019-05-08 and close on 2019-05-15.
- Mentee signups will open on 2019-05-29 and close on 2019-06-08.
- The summer 2019 cycle will start on 2019-06-12 and end on 2019-09-11.

During this time, the internal organisation team will host a variety of events on the Discord server, such as mapping contests, modding puzzles, or even just things like multiplayer lobbies with integrated feedback sessions! Some mentors also hold lectures from time to time that are accompanied or followed by an open round of questions from the mentees. A compendium of those can be found over at [this thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/514122). If lectures and all aren't for you and you're more of a do-it-yourself person, [this thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/565382) collects a lot of mapping puzzles that have been created within the scope of this program to mess around with yourself!

If you or anyone you know might be interested in applying, go ahead and check out the [forum announcement and rules thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/894182)!

We're looking forward to the next generation of mentors and mentees!
