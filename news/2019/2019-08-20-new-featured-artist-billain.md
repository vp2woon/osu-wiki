[**Billain**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/46) descends onto the scene as osu!'s latest Featured Artist, complete with a selection of tracks from his latest album, *Nomad's Revenge*!

Made famous in osu! by the giant collaborative beatmap [**Boogie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/411435#osu/966177) hosted by [Spaghetti](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4761930) back in 2016, [**Billain**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/46) has been an eminent name among much of the high-end mapping scene ever since.

His unique fusion of atmospheric, neurofunk-inspired sound design interwoven with classic drum & bass style leads produces a uniquely compelling long-form experience that we're sure people are bound to pick up and experiment with.

Some people have historically turned their brain off when confronted with tracks longer than two minutes long—but really, give them a shot! There's a reason almost all of the notable beatmaps people remember fondly are pretty long ones.

We've managed to nab a selection of **18** tracks from his widely varied library, including five tracks from his latest release with *Renraku Global Media*, [*Nomad's Revenge*](https://renraku.bandcamp.com/album/nomads-revenge).

You know the drill by now, all of the above tracks and **MORE** are available pre-timed and pre-packaged for your convenience over at [**Billain**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/46), all 100% free for use in mapping your wildest dreams.

We're somehow managing to keep this ludicrous pace going with new Featured Artist releases, and there's no sign of things slowing down soon!

Since a goodly number of people have recently awakened to the fact that yes, we do indeed try to hint at upcoming releases in these articles, here's one for our last release of August:

The deck's pretty majorly stacked for this one.

Whatever could it mean? Don't lose sleep over it, find out at the end of the month! Was that a hint too? Is this a hint? Maybe I'm being too forceful with all this. Hmm.
