Did you miss Scorewatch? We're back again with some insane plays to showcase all around the board. Come check out what the most skilled players in osu! have been up to!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-02-03-scorewatch-20-january-to-2-february/banner.jpg)

The Scorewatch project has been inactive for quite a while now, but [FayeurS 5](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263) and I are making an effort to bring it back. For now, we'll be running on a bi-weekly schedule (instead of the previous weekly): we're still working out the organization of this project and don't have a lot of people contributing. Next time, we will have more information about the future of Scorewatch and how you can contribute, if you would like to =).

Videos will be provided where available, but unfortunately some cannot be shared due to copyright concerns or other reasons.

That being said, let's check out the scores!

[idke](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4650315): [AugoEidEs [oyasumi]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/346104#osu/764082) +HR **A** (2432/2472x, 99.52%)\
*20 January 2019, Loved*

Starting us off this week, HardRock extraordinaire idke proves himself with this attempt on AugoEidEs, coming shockingly close to a full combo while holding an accuracy unrivaled by the other HR plays. This map is already a monster without mods, and idke's score here makes it seem as though it's hardly even a challenge for him to add the mod on top of it!

[Gayzmcgee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1419095): [The Near Distant Future [Lapse]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/97433#osu/260489) +DT **A** (2563/2677x, 99.52%) 496pp\
*29 January 2019, Ranked*

I think everybody forgot to remind Gayzmcgee that you're not supposed to use DT on this map... seriously, it's already a feat of itself to score a full combo on this draining marathon; coming this close to a DT FC (with this insane accuracy) is totally nuts! Words don't do much justice to the level of speed that Gayzmcgee can play well at, so I highly encourage you to watch the video for yourself.

[NerO](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1545031): [Six Trillion Years and Overnight Story [0108's Extra]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/790060#osu/1665564) +FL **Silver SS** 387pp\
*29 January 2019, Ranked*

NerO continues to impress everybody with his phenomenal flashlight performances, this score being one of his best. Being an 0108 map at over 6 stars and OD8.8, an SS by itself would be respectable, but this madman does it with FL on top of that.

This guy is crazy. I don't know what else to say.

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qPmH6IdURKk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Gayzmcgee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1419095): [Poppin' Shower [Another]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/42527#osu/133723) +DT **SS** 451pp\
*2 February 2019, Ranked*

With this map having received only three DT FCs in total, this score blows the others out of the water with its perfect accuracy. Rhythm and patterning coming straight from 2012 makes this no small feat! Almost as impressive as the accuracy is Gayz's snappy aim that follows even the small bends of the sliders present throughout this map. I'm glad there's a video of this play because even the SS rank doesn't convey how "perfect" this play really is.

[lain](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1650010): [A Young Girl, So Vivid in the Night [Taeyang's style]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/303778#osu/680689) **A** (548x, 93.59%)\
*22 January 2019, Loved*

A few years ago, it was something impressive to just clear this map, but lain now shows us that he's capable of setting a respectable A rank on this too. With difficulty and oddly-placed jump patterns, spaced sliderstreams and an overall speed-driven map at 280 BPM, this map makes for a challenge incomparable to the others of its (already ridiculous) star range.

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gb2LfT7e6Ew?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[idke](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4650315): [Atama no Taisou [Nogard]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/40344#osu/133938) +HR **S** (FC, 99.30%) 510pp\
*24 January 2019, Approved*

This old gem of a map got the idke treatment last week, with an HR FC that reaches max combo as well as an accuracy unrivaled by the other plays. It seems like this round of Scorewatch there's a trend of idke getting these even-more-perfect versions of scores we've seen in the past, which is crazy considering that all of them were pushing the limits to begin with. If you're a fan of older maps, you'll surely be impressed by idke's performance here!

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-6KDtisXFRc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[idke](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4650315): [HIBANA feat. Hatsune Miku [Lock On]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/671199#osu/1419243) +HR **S** (FC, 99.69%) 712pp\
*29 January 2019, Ranked*

The first HR FC on this map also has near-perfect accuracy, as is almost standard now for idke. This map is a generic one, but it's got all of the staples of modern difficulty that make a high-accuracy HR score that much more impressive. Where most other players choke, idke's consistency prevails!

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Br5RLnC6aBM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Gayzmcgee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1419095): [The Promethean Kings [The Merciless]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/480651#osu/1083470) **A** (1,276x, 93.48%) 205pp\
*25 January 2019, Ranked*

Gayz has been on a roll, hasn't he? This score is nothing short of madness, featuring his light-speed tapping and aiming coming together to score the first A-rank on the hardest Ranked map in the game. With complex rhythm and unconventional patterning at over 9 stars, an unmatched A-rank here deserves its place well.

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LcwcTxJnDiw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[fieryrage](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3533958): [quaver [Fiery's Extra]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/873811#osu/1843653) +HR,DT **A** (416/431x, 97.11%) 897pp\
*27 January 2019, Ranked*

fieryrage's play on his own map here highlights a level of aim speed almost unrivaled by other mouse players. I can only describe this as a stupidly fast and intense aim-heavy score, so please take a look at the replay to see that I can't exaggerate this enough! Especially the ending. Like, what even is that o_O

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4TvxQuvEWpc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Varvalian](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3345902): [neu [end?]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/843008#osu/1763938) +HR **S** (FC, 99.68%) 661pp\
*20 January 2019, Ranked*

This map has it all, from streams that change their spacing to good old fashion jumps, but that doesn't stop Varvalian from conquering the whole thing without breaking a sweat. This score displays an incredible control that Varvalian has over any kind of pattern.

## osu!taiko

[goheegy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8057655): [True Blue [DJ Command Mix] (Full Ver.) [Broken Love]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/643803#taiko/1364659) +DT **S** (99.87%) 546pp\
*27 January 2019, Ranked*

This is one of goheegy's most consistent DoubleTime scores that he's ever achieved. With an outstanding 6x100, he's taken the record for the highest consistency on the DoubleTime leaderboards for this map, all while performing this outstanding play under the DDKK playstyle, which is one that not many players have mastered.

[shinchikuhome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3174184): [A Fool Moon Night [Lv.300]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/538780#taiko/1526770) +DT **S** (99.80%)\
*25 January 2019, Loved*

shinchikuhome manages to show us time and time again how impressive his DoubleTime skills are as he FCs the Loved map, "A Fool Moon Night". It may seem like this is pretty easy at first, but this map contains a long barrage of 1/8 doublets clocking in at over 200 BPM, which makes it extremely difficult to hit them all in succession. He is one of the only two people that has been able to FC this map at such a rapid speed.

[goheegy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8057655): [HAELEQUINZ -the clown of 24stairs- [Knights of the Round]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/623427#taiko/1313997) +HR **S** (99.55%) 460pp\
*26 January 2019, Ranked*

This map is a very good indicator of showing just how much goheegy's HR skills have progressed over the past few months. With the only HR FC at a very high 99.55% accuracy on the leaderboards, he has shown to be quite capable of being able to consistently read even the trickiest of 1/6 patterns.

## osu!catch

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b0wSWWGZCNM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Motion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3885626): [Target o Kowase! [Click the Circles!]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/542759#fruits/1150427) +HD,DT **Silver SS** 408pp\
*20 January 2019, Ranked*

Very impressive demonstration of Motion's DT platter control. This play, with an amount of ridiculously fast sliders, just shows how much of a skilled player Motion is. Despite the play being only 32 seconds, it's an amazing show of skill.

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ox64P8ObR1I?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Motion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3885626): [Dried Up Youthful Fame (TV Size) [Collab Overdose]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/544889#fruits/1154582) +HD,DT **Silver S** (FC, 99.75%) 706pp\
*20 January 2019, Ranked*

Despite this map looking quite your usual pp map on NoMod, Motion took it to the next level by getting the first ever FC on it, while being the second HDDT pass along with [ekr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4497706), who "only" has 97.73% accuracy, compared to Motion's impressive 99.75% FC. This map is quite a ruthless 330 BPM jump map with DT, and is definitely worth looking at.

[Shyeart](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2022144): [Rainbow Dash Likes Girls (Stay Gay Pony Girl) [Holy Shit! It's Rainbow Dash!!]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/57255#fruits/172662) **SS** 358pp\
*22 January 2019, Ranked*

After nearly 7 years of it existing, Shyeart finally does what may have been considered impossible before this point, FC'ing Rainbow Dash with nomod. Funnily enough, this ended up happening the same month [Vaxei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4787150) got the first ever FC on it, but on standard too.

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IqQilwXoOVM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Dusk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533210): [Kikoku Doukoku Jigokuraku [Notch Hell]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/437683#fruits/942356) **S** (1402x, 98.14%) 178pp\
*28 January 2019, Ranked*

This score is well... quite something. An S on this map was to be expected after it got featured on AxS, one of the biggest tournaments in osu!catch, but not with this kind of ridiculous combo that Dusk got, being the 3rd best combo AND the second S ever on the map. Especially since you have to give up your accuracy usually, if you want to get a good combo on this map, but Dusk just comes and shows a ridiculous amount of control to be able to get such a score.

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sTSUqpLGpDk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[ekr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4497706): [RESISTER (TV Size) [Overdose]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/909911#fruits/1898783) +HD,DT **Silver S** (99.51%) 779pp\
*27 January 2019, Ranked*

ekr comes through with an impressive FC, on an AR9.4DT jump map, where not only he has the first pass, but also the first FC ever, and that only within three days of the map being ranked.

## osu!mania

[Jakads](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/259972): [Doppelganger [jakads' Extra]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/407153#mania/1023967) +NC **S** (847,305 95.93%) 1083pp\
*20 January 2019, Ranked*

jakads being jakads as always, comes in and sets the new pp record in mania, now sitting at 1083pp, done on his own map as well. This way, he also breaks the older pp record, held by... himself, on the higher difficulty of this mapset, which is worth 1078pp.

[WindyS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1190879): [Smiling [Be Happy]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/810911#mania/1701215) +DT **S** (922,006 98.34%) 945pp\
*1 February 2019, Ranked*

WindyS, one of the best 7K players in this game, off to a strong comeback already after nearly one year of abscence. Getting such a score on an insanely hard 9.21* map, which only 7 people in the world have S'd, and he just goes and gets a 98.34% on it. Honestly, this score is way easier to appreciate by looking at it at this point, seeing how ridiculous it is.

[WindyS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1190879): [Just Hold on (To All Fighters) [Resolve]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/409440#mania/888793) +DT **S** (876,859 96.79%) 925pp\
*1 February 2019, Ranked*

Now for the second score of WindyS here, which may be just as ridiculous as the first one. As a side note, this map is 6.87 stars nomod, and becomes 9.57 stars with DT. It's just pure stream and LN-hell at 255 BPM for 3 minutes only yes, but it is definitely not the easiest stamina-wise still.

[wonder5193](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8474029): [What is Love? [I Wanna Know]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/765296#mania/1609060) **S** (993,263 99.94%)\
*1 February 2019, Loved*

wonder is back at it again, getting the first FC ever on a map, with the best accuracy and ratio on the leaderboard. This map is extremely LN-heavy, so being consistent on 6k combo of this, *and* getting only 6x100 on this makes it even more impressive.

That's a wrap on this round of Scorewatch! Stay tuned for future updates!
