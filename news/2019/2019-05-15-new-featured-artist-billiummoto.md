The winner of the first ever osu!remix contest enters the scene as osu!'s latest Featured Artist! Say hello to [**BilliumMoto**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/38)!

After surging to victory with his track *HDHR* in our [first-ever remix contest back in 2016](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-08-29-osuremix-contest-1-results), we've had our eye on **BilliumMoto** ever since.

A member of the osu!community for over five years and a [much](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/631054) [beloved](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/401088) [osu!mania mapper](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/204326), he's certainly no stranger to the intricacies of making things tick, and joins the roster alongside artists like [tieff](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/34) who have long-standing expertise in mapping for their communities of choice.

As one could reasonably expect from a resident osu!maniac, much of **BilliumMoto**'s sound is the kind of frantic, comes-at-you-fast craziness that VSRGs thrive on. Inspired by a bunch of musical twists from over half a dozen genres, his sound is both familiar and delightfully fresh, with rhythmic progression that constantly shakes things up and keeps you on your toes for what could come next.

We're delighted to host **8** unique tracks from him, all of which are now available over at [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/38).

Here's a quick sample of a few:

As always, all of the tracks above plus the rest available on [**BilliumMoto**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/38) are 100% free for use in modding and mapping, and come packaged in pre-timed beatmaps. Handy!

We're unofficially declaring May as the "home-grown" month for the Featured Artist project, and boy do we have a surprise slated for our next release at the end of the month. Keep your eyes and ears peeled; you won't want to miss out!

In other extra news, we've recently welcomed a few more hands into the particulars of the Featured Artist project to keep things moving at a blazing pace, namely [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689) and [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418), so prepare yourself for a continuation of the two-a-month release cycle we've been holding strong all year so far!
