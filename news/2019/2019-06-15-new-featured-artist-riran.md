osu!'s latest Featured Artist enters the scene in style - hardstyle in fact! Meet [**RiraN**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/40), one of Asia's up and coming hardstyle artists!

We're dedicated towards ensuring a variety of musical styles remain represented in our choice of upcoming Featured Artists, and **RiraN** leads the charge into a sound that many rhythm gamers know and love - hardstyle.

Featured across many other rhythm games, music competitions and compilation albums, **RiraN** has been gradually gaining steam in the scene since 2015. We're proud to introduce his work to osu! with a selection of **nine** new tracks featuring his signature hardstyle hits, all neatly bundled into less than three minutes per piece.

Interested? Check out a sample of a few tracks below:

All of the above plus more are now available over at [**RiraN**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/40), 100% free for use in mapping.

The [Mappers' Guild](http://mappersguild.com/) will also be hosting a series of quests based on these new tracks in the coming days, so if you're a member of the Guild and fancy a stab at some hardstyle mapping, start preparing! If you're not yet a member of the Guild - get three ranked maps to your name and come aboard.

If this sort of sound is your jam, get excited because we've got more coming at the end of the month! A LOT more. The observant among you may have already caught wind of a little hint we dropped at the beginning of June.

As an extra note, you may see a few more releases from us over the coming weeks - [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) and [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689) have been hard at work securing a *gigantic* roster of new talent from a variety of genres and musical styles both familiar and fresh that we're super hyped to share with you guys.

Keep your eyes and ears peeled!
