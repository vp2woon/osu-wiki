The featured artists of osu! have been receiving more love than ever before! Come and take a look at what's been happening within the Mappers' Guild!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/mappersguild.png)

It's only been two months since our [previous news article](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2019-09-24-mappers-guild-september-newspost) on the Mappers' Guild, yet quite a bit has progressed, with 8 quests completed and over 80 beatmaps of songs by featured artists reaching ranked status!

For those out of the loop, the Mappers' Guild is a system for mappers with more than three ranked maps to earn rewards for creating beatmaps of songs from the Featured Artist library. Following in the footsteps of MMOs, the Guild publishes weekly quests for mappers to undertake for extra rewards, however its members can still participate by mapping any featured artists songs they desire! If you're at all interested in the Guild, take a look at the [Mappers' Guild website](https://mappersguild.com/) for more information!

Today we'll be going over finished quests from the Mappers' Guild, featured artist beatmap pack updates, and a list of all ranked featured artist maps since our last news post in September. Without further adieu, let's start going through each quest completed since last update!

![Aleph header](/wiki/shared/news/2019-11-29-featured-artist-beatmap-updates-from-the-mappers-guild/aleph.jpg)

For the **2 (osu!taiko)** quest, mappers had to create and rank at least 2 mapsets of songs by an unpublished featured artist, each hosted by a different user. When licensing songs from Dictate, osu! also licensed 2 tracks by the artist ALEPH, but only 2 songs were not enough for their own Featured Artist listing, so the songs have not been listed on the website. That said, the 2 songs are licensed and free to use for mapping on osu!, so be sure to check the songs out and map them if you like them "2"!

## Pack updates

This month we also have some changes and additions to our collection of beatmap packs. A couple of packs have been moved and renamed as part of a new system to make featured artist packs more consistent going forward! Packs for artists will get their own artist packs, while packs for general themes or ideas that include multiple artists will be made into numbered "Mappers' Guild" packs.

The packs changed are as follows:

- **Mappers' Guild Pack III** has been changed to [High Tea Pack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs/1480)
- **Mappers' Guild Pack IV** has been changed to [Culprate Pack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs/1535)
- **Vocaloid Pack** has been changed to [Mappers' Guild Pack III](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs/1689)

The High Tea and Culprate medals have been also updated accordingly, with anyone who unlocked them before still having the achievements under the new names.

**New featured artist packs** this month:

- [\*namirin Pack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs/1704): Compiling various \*namirin maps ranked by the community.
- [LukHash Pack (osu!catch)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs/1758): Maps from the *LukHash mini-pack* quest where the party went above and beyond the quest's 4 map requirement.
- [Rin Pack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs/1759): Includes maps of Rin songs from the *From the Vault* and *Rin pack* quests.
- [Mappers' Guild Pack IV](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs/1757): Maps from the *High Tempo pack* quest. Every mapset here is of a song over 200BPM.
- [The Flashbulb Pack (osu!, osu!taiko, osu!catch)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs/1762): Compiled from two quests focused on The Flashbulb's featured artist tracks, this pack features maps of The Flashbulb's music across osu!, osu!taiko, and osu!catch.

We will be working on adding more beatmap packs and new medals regularly, so be sure to keep an eye out for that!

## Ranked map updates

This list includes all maps of featured artist tracks ranked since the previous newspost, even those mentioned previously in the quests section above. New to this round-up, we are including maps from outside the guild as well so that readers can keep up to date with all maps of songs by our featured artists!

Non-guild maps will be marked with an asterisk `*`.
