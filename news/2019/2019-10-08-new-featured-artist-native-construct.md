**Native Construct** joins the roster as our latest Featured Artist with a selection of 7 tracks from their debut release, *Quiet World*!

Turning heads and drawing crowds since their explosive entrance into the prog metal scene in 2015, **Native Construct** is a fresh musical experience we're excited to introduce to the osu!community.

A unique blend of a variety of musical and compositional styles, **Native Construct**'s *Quiet World* is a concept album built upon the themes of rejection and silence, rendered in a theatrical manner quite unlike anything we've encountered in a long while. Inspired by big-name acts like Queen and Pink Floyd, we're certain that people will find something new and exciting to engage with.

Don't just take our word for it though, check them out for yourself:

If you've followed the Featured Artist project closely since release, you've read this particular paragraph fifty times by now (yay milestones!), but as always, all of the above tracks and more are available now over at [**Native Construct's** Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/50), so go forth and create without fear or worry!

This new release schedule of ours is really getting complex, but we're dedicated to keeping it up. It's been a real odyssey so far, and we're super excited to say that we've got enough weekly releases in the wings now to last us until the end of 2019 - and even beyond! We hope that our intrepid mappers have the courage to square up to all of this new material to work with.

Check in next week for another artist to sink your teeth into! Hold on... where was the hint?!
