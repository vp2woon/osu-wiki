Bringing a founding member of the early osu! mapping scene back into the limelight in a whole new way, we're proud to announce our latest addition to the Featured Artist roster - tieff!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/34/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/34)

Here since almost the very beginning, just about everyone with even a passing knowledge of osu!'s history will know **tieff**'s  name as one of the old 'great' mappers who laid out the creative foundations that we now all take for granted.

**tieff** has been with the osu!community for nearly **10 years**, sporting a fruitful tenure in the Beatmap Approval Team (the precursor to the modern-day Quality Assurance Team) and gaining the honour of joining the ranks of the osu!alumni in respect for his many years of service.

Except now, he's back, and as our latest Featured Artist!

Inspired by his experiences with mapping, much of **tieff**'s work is a natural match for anyone looking to delve into a slower-paced, highly emotive sound. Featuring influences from a variety of genres such as instrumental hip-hop, chillout, future garage, melodic dubstep and progressive trance, his artistry lies in a wonderful in-between, and we're super excited to see what people make of it.

Don't take my word for it, listen to a small selection of some of the tracks now available over at [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/34):
