We're proud to welcome **KOAN Sound** aboard as our latest Featured Artist! 16 tracks now available, including all of their latest album, *Intervals Above*!

Showcased in osu! since early 2015 by [Aiceo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4453280)'s set of [Starlite](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/294496) (featuring Asa), **KOAN Sound** has been something of an underground hit in the osu! community among the mapping scenes and abroad. Further from home, the enigmatic duo has toured extensively worldwide, supporting headline acts like *Skrillex*, *Pretty Lights* and more. They're also currently on tour at the moment around the United States with *Haywyre* in a show titled "In Parallel".

Undeniable masters of electronic music, **KOAN Sound** has so much going in their work that it is genuinely difficult to describe them one way or another. *Polychrome* is full of inexplicably chill but rhythmic and sometimes jazzy funk, while *Intervals Above* is all billowing melodic synthlines underscored by percussive wonder.

Don't have a clue what I'm getting at? Never fear, their music tells the full story better than I ever could:

All these and more add up to **16** brand new tracks awaiting you over on their [Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/49), all pre-timed and ready for you to experiment with. We're excited to see what people come up with to some more complex electronic sounds, especially after all of the metal we've had blasting about lately.

We might've been a little too easy on the hint last time given how many people correctly guessed it *(better luck next time unko)*. That being said, our next release slated for the end of the month is a big, **BIG** set of updates from some of our current Featured Artists.

No riddles to contemplate this time. We'll just let you stew in the hype of what's to come, because boy is there some good stuff poised to arrive very, very soon. After that, it'll be right back to names familiar and fresh, every 10 days like clockwork.
