A bunch of new beatmap packs are available, and they were created by an open team dubbed the Beatmap Pack Management. Come check it all out!

The Beatmap Pack Management is here to make more beatmap packs focused on a variety of themes for the community to enjoy! For those unaware, here's some more information about us:

A small group has been created of experienced users interested in working on packs dedicated to specific themes, similarities, and ideas. We've been actively working since July 2019 to provide new and interesting packs to play! Since we began the Beatmap Pack Management initiative, interest in this project has been very high, and some noteworthy members of the community have also joined the group to help us by contributing their ideas. The project is also dedicated to provide active monitoring to the community and the first place to contact for any problems related to beatmap packs. We already have a few things to present to you which we're sure you'll like: check out the packs below!

### Alternator Style packs

Download [Ranked](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs/1699) | [Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs/1700)

Aireu and Uberzolik were passionate enough to work on the very first mapping-style-specific beatmap packs released. These two packs are focused on beatmaps where alternating is essential. Aireu worked on the Ranked version, while Uberzolik took care of the Loved version. If you need maps to practice alternating, or you are good at it already and want to challenge yourself, you should check these packs out!

### The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil pack

Available to download now, this pack is the first of the Touhou game packs, where a selection of various Touhou maps from a specific game is picked and curated just for you! This pack contains beatmaps from the first non-PC-98 Touhou game, and the sixth game in the series: The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. The pack aims to offer a variety of styles and themes, ranging from 2008 to 2018 to offer something enjoyable for everyone. Packs for future games are currently in progress and should be released in the near future. Enjoy!

### Best of 2010–2011 pack

Ever wanted to see what popular maps looked like in earlier eras of the game? Well now you can—you can check out some of the best maps that the game had to offer during 2010 and 2011 in a single pack! While there are a lot of great maps, we didn't have enough room to include everything, so hopefully you can find something on this list that you will enjoy. Play through them all and experience a blast from the past!

### osu!dan project

*written by [celerih](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4696296)*

The osu!dan project is a brand new community created project that seeks to provide a "campaign mode" to the game. Players will progress through levels of increasing difficulty in a skill of their choice, such as aim, stamina, accuracy, et cetera.

Each of the dans will contain 20 levels of increasing difficulty. In order to complete a level, the player must reach the requirements on the maps presented, such as a certain accuracy threshold or a full combo. For now, the release of dan levels is purely for fun or practice, but a more official implementation is planned for the future. ;)

The first of the dans is available to download now on the Beatmap Packs listing. The skill tested in this pack is aim and will surely push your circle clicking to the limits. The requirements for this dan are quite simple: you need to achieve full combo on 10 out of 11 maps in the dan to progress to the next level. Once again, this for now is just for your own practice, or to compare yourself with your friends—there is no implementation of tracking your progress, for now.

If you wish to help with playtesting future packs and want to stay up-to-date, you can join the official [osu!dan Discord server](https://discord.gg/b7cVmGd)!

### October Loved packs

*written by [Stefan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/626907)*

The time came once again to bundle a few beatmaps, with some new Loved beatmap packs being made available in mid-October. That said, I want to take this chance to explain why Loved beatmaps do not get bundled into packs right away. Since there is always a small chance that a beatmap can become unloved, I decided to give maps at least a minimum of 10 months to stay in Loved, and then afterwards bundle the Loved beatmaps into packs. While it's no guarantee they will stay in Loved forever, it works for me and I'll go by that for now. Changes can always happen though and I am open for alternatives!

### Holiday Pack 2019

Supported by the [Christmas Queue](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/985375) for 9 years and counting, holiday cheer in osu! is still going strong! This year we have compiled a pack of winter and holiday related beatmaps for everyone to enjoy during the season. The pack features beatmaps of new favorites and classic songs, all with difficulties for various skill levels! While the pack features mainly osu! maps, there's also two osu!catch spreads and an osu!mania map included for those who enjoy other modes.

### What else to expect

While I believe we're doing very well already, we're also just getting started. Currently, I'm the only active person that coordinates the uploads, as well as the accessibility and maintenance of the packs, so it's a little slow. But I'm glad I could help a lot of people so far and that I have received so much great feedback. If you are interested in taking a look at what we are working on, want to report an error/bug in a pack or want to join the group, please check out our [forum thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/933379).

I also recommend following [@osuMapPacks](https://twitter.com/osuMapPacks) on Twitter to stay up-to-date with news, fixes, new packs, and more. With that said, I can't really say when the next news post will be, since we're a group that takes time to work on packs individually, but you can still contact me if you have any questions. I hope you have an amazing day and download lots of packs. Thank you for reading!
