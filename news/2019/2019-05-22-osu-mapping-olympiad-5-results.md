This installment of the Mapping Olympiad contest challenged mappers to create a pair of difficulties for *[Virtual Self](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/28)*'s EON BREAK. As an additional challenge, participants were asked to showcase different mapping styles between the two entries to demonstrate their creativity, in reference to the two personas 'Pathselector' and 'technic-Angel' that make up *Virtual Self*. Below are the results:

We'd like to thank all of the judges who spent their time going through and judging all of the entries: [Electoz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6485263), [Myxomatosis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2202645), [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418), and [Sonnyc](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11771).

You can see all of the scores and comments from the judges [via this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nJ9uyasmJpj0cmsP-6mDDHsmjLxCV2lF20Y8RmmA74A), and you can [click here to check out all of the entries!](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1w53t4grwOSK2hM3ZCcW012-gdJVNrzaU).

As a brief aside, for those of you who may have been wondering about the osu!taiko and osu!mania contests, we apologize for the delay. A number of unexpected circumstances came up between the judges for both contests, but we will finally be able to announce the results for both contests soon.

Thank you to everyone who participated and showed interest, and congratulations once again to [**Necho**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4086593) and [**Ryuusei Aika**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7777875)! We look forward to seeing you all and more in the next Olympiad contest!
