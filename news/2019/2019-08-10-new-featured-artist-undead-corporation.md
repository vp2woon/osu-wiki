You know them, you love them. From timeless classics like *Everything will freeze* and *The Empress*, **UNDEAD CORPORATION** have held a dear spot in the osu! community's heart for the better part of a decade.

And now, we are delighted to announce once and for all that it is finally official!

**111** metal masterpieces await over at [their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/45) for you to sink your teeth into, with many of these covering the considerable library of already ranked beatmaps that we're all familiar with.

We've also managed to snag the full ensemble of their two original albums - *O.D* and *NO ANTIDOTE*. Be sure to check them out!

In case you've forgotten, check out the samples below:

As usual, all of these amazing tracks and a **HUGE** amount more are available right now over at [**UNDEAD CORPORATION**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/45), pre-timed for your convenience. These are 100% free for use in mapping, so get out there and get creating with them!

Those so inclined may wish to spare pishifat a moment of thanks, as anyone who has ever timed this sort of music can attest to how outrageously difficult it can get sometimes! Now imagine that, a hundred and eleven times over. Crazy stuff.

The pace continues, and we're excited to bring even more names both familiar and fresh to you later on in the month. No more hints this time. Revenge for the particularly awful one that suggested this release.

Was that a hint? Guess you'll find out in 10 days time!
