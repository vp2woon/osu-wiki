Decadence descends upon osu! with the latest addition to the Featured Artist lineup - Imperial Circus Dead Decadence!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/35/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/35)

Held in high regard within the osu! community since their impromptu debut in 2016 with [Kite's iconic beatmap of Uta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/410162#osu/890190), **Imperial Circus Dead Decadence** has never been far from any thrill-seeking player's mind, their sound firmly established in some of the most difficult and endurance-testing sets that the game has ever seen.

We've thrown the gates to this decadent hell wide open, and are proud to welcome them as [our latest Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/35)!

Intrepid mappers will be delighted to discover **three** albums to pick through at their leisure, all rife with their classic frantically fast-paced, hellishly hectic and monstrously metal sound.

But naturally, don't take our word for it! Here's a few samples of just a snippet of what's available now [over at their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/35):

### Uta

As is the usual, all of the above plus **much** more is available immediately for use in modding and mapping over at [their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/35).

And in distinctly different-but-related news, the Mappers' Guild is back and with its doors wide open to anyone with **3** ranked beatmaps or more! If that's you, or if you're interested in what the rest of the project entails, make sure to [check out the thread discussing the changes](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/875743) and get involved!

Those in the Guild will find themselves facing several brand new quests using some of **Imperial Circus Dead Decadence**'s tracks, all for fun, glory, and sweet, sweet shinies.

Later on in the month, we'll be releasing a new set of updates for some Featured Artists that you already know and love. Keep your eyes and ears peeled for the details!
