Spring might've come a *little* late in osu! this year, but that has not deterred our incredible community artists from creating some wonderful pieces to celebrate everyone's bloomin' favorite season!

The voting turnout was fairly spectacular this time around as well, with over 10,000 people casting a vote for their favorite pieces, something typically only matched by our Halloween festivities! Crazy stuff.

Without further ado, let's get stuck into the winning entries - which, might I remind you, are now featured in-game as the seasonal backgrounds for Spring 2019. Their stupendously talented artists also receive **2 months of osu!supporter** for their efforts!

*By the by, you can click the little banners to be taken to a full-size, high quality download for each entry!*

Turning heads and taking names with a whopping **6593** votes, [**TofuMang**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4817223)'s rendition of a pippi almost too adorable for this world was a literal showstopper, surging to win the contest handily with almost a thousand vote lead.

Stunning is one word, superb is another. There's many things we could say, but only one thing that everyone is thinking: wow.

Well done!

Surging into second place, spectacularly serious samurai Mocha snagged the hearts of **5543** voters in [**Sunako**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2801166)'s fantastic piece.

This marks perhaps the first time in any of the Fan Art contests where anyone has drawn Mocha in such a mature, elegant poise, and all everyone can think of is 'why hasn't anyone done this sooner?!'

Sunako is quickly becoming something of a veteran entrant to these fanart contests, and her work is as wonderful as ever.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-03-spring-2019-fanart-contest-results/pvtz.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/78/winners/pvtz.png)

[**Pvtz**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4698044)'s schoolgirl rendition of a very inviting pippi scored **5060** votes, and was a sure-fire favorite of the contest from the very start of the voting.

Who is that mysterious figure in the top right? Will we ever know?

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-03-spring-2019-fanart-contest-results/cieu.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/78/winners/cieu.png)

**4304** votes fell like rain from the skies to laud [**Cieu**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2837685) floral depiction of a weatherbound pippi and three adorable ribbon-bowed teru teru bozu appreciating the bounty of Spring.

Something about the gentle gradient of light lavender into a cloudy grey is such a beautifully alternative take on Spring's classic flowery hues, and it just works wonderfully.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-03-spring-2019-fanart-contest-results/rambuu.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/78/winners/rambuu.png)

[**Rambuu**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13291482)'s portrayal of pippi riding the skies on a giant Japanese festive fish gobbled up **4235** votes.

This one was just off the scales. Or out of this world, or possibly both. Puns notwithstanding, its creativity and composition was clearly a favourite of many voters.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-03-spring-2019-fanart-contest-results/voidsynatic.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/78/winners/voidsynatic.png)

**3660** voters approved of [**VoidSynatic**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8270353)'s take on the main-line four mascots lazing about in the grass before a tree, complete with a little thematic item of choice for each one.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-03-spring-2019-fanart-contest-results/yukii-hatsune.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/78/winners/yukii-hatsune.png)

**3435** voters knew the real flowers in [**Yukii Hatsune**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5843247)'s piece were pippi and Mocha themselves!

Everything about this entry screams 'please enjoy', and hoo boy did people enjoy it. Look at them both! They're adorable.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-03-spring-2019-fanart-contest-results/maaayonnaise.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/78/winners/maaayonnaise.png)

It wouldn't be a fanart contest without some festive garb, and **3202** voters got their pippi fix from [**raukisu**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9756665)'s vibrant entry.

There's just something enchanting about the combination of kimono and pippi that never goes out of style, and it really helps when talented artists do this and add a bunch more of their own style into the mix to boot!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-03-spring-2019-fanart-contest-results/lackingskill.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/78/winners/lackingskill.png)

**2919** voters joined Mocha on the school rooftop in [**Lackingskill**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10323168)'s skylit piece.

Don't get too distracted by the celestial skies above - just look at Mocha's clothes! From a Taikonator themed backpack and more accessories than you could shake a kit at, this wonderful work gets bonus points from this humble writer for giving Mocha a very believable fashion sense all of her own.

And maybe a couple of merchandise ideas to boot!

Like little ground-locked clouds, **2720** votes fell into [**Stelf333**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6912611)'s lap from their rendition of an airy, quintessentially Spring vista sporting an appreciating pippi on the side.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-03-spring-2019-fanart-contest-results/saoie.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/78/winners/saoie.png)

**2691** voters appreciated [**saoie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6015875) simplistic yet enchanting rendition of Mocha adorned with all the bounty of Spring. This one will look extra special on the main menu thanks to clever use of the cookie as the centerpiece!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-03-spring-2019-fanart-contest-results/alcott.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/78/winners/alcott.png)

**2505** people took to the skies and casst their vote for [**alcott**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9129536) elysium wonderland, complete with floating isles and glowing butterflies beside pippi and Mocha in yukata-style dress.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-03-spring-2019-fanart-contest-results/nekobread.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/78/winners/nekobread.png)

**2410** voters were irresistibly compelled to cast click on [**NEKOBREAD**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6259161)'s take of pippi, pippidon and Mocha enjoying some festive viewing of the sakura bloom.

There are times where Mocha's existence seems just too cute for this world, and this entry showcases one of those instances in all its glory.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-03-spring-2019-fanart-contest-results/lancelmiku.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/78/winners/lancelmiku.png)

**2380** votes fluttered on in for [**LanceLMiku**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1809907)'s take on a gentle pippi appreciating the Spring winds with some butterfly companions.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-03-spring-2019-fanart-contest-results/phoebe-yu.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/78/winners/phoebe-yu.png)

**2277** voters went for a walk with [**Phoebe Yu**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3607337)'s portrayal of a parasol pippi enjoying a walk along a sakura-rimmed path, complete with Taikonator accessory.
