Blaze on over to [the contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/78) now and lay claim to your **15** entries of choice! Given that there's 137 entries to fight for your vote, the running will be as fiercely competitive as ever this year!

A selection of the top-voted entries will make it into the osu! game client as Spring 2019's seasonal backgrounds for all to enjoy, and their supremely talented authors will nab **2 months of osu!supporter** for their hard-won efforts.

We've prepared a little preview of the entries in video format for you to enjoy below, featuring the tunes from an upcoming collaboration that is bound to hit a beatmap near you in the future:
