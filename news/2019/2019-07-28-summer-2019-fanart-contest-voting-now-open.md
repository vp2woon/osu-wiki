Check out [the contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/79) for an absolute onslaught of incredible entries to choose from. We can't take them all though - remember that you've only got **20** votes to go around, so choose wisely!

A selection from the top-voted entries will be featured in the osu! game client as the Summer 2019 seasonal backgrounds for several weeks, and their superbly skilled authors will also score **2 months of osu!supporter** to commemorate their drawing skill.

As is tradition at this point, here's a little preview of all the entries set to the tunes of [**Wisp X**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/16)'s Eventide:
