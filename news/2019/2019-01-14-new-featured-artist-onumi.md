Drawing deep from the sounds of the underground, the Featured Artist project welcomes **onumi** into the mix!

Featuring some of the darkest electronica we've fielded in the project yet, we're proud to announce the addition of [**onumi**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/32) to the Featured Artist roster with all of her latest album release, *Childhood Friend*, plus a few extra selections from her body of work.

Intense, confronting and just outright hostile, **onumi**'s sound drills deep and hard with powerfully gritty and thunderous basslines, coupled with an almost playful disregard for common rhythm structure. Touching on a variety of genre influences but never quite settling too hard on any particular one, **onumi**'s sound is something quite unique, and is likely to appeal to fans of dystopian, industrial or cyberpunk themes.

Consistent yet somehow wildly unpredictable, we fully expect many mappers fond of more technical approaches to map construction to thrive within her sound, and we also figure that more than a few osu!mania creators might be particularly fond of her work as well.

Be warned, not a single one of these tracks is for the faint of heart!

Check out a quick sample of a few below, or [head on over to her listing now to get started](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/32):
