Riding the wake of viral fame achieved by the music video of 2011 hit *No One Survives*, **Nekrogoblikon** has continued to push the boundaries of their own musicianship through wild experimentation, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, and an undying allegiance to goblin-kind.

**10** songs off the band's most recent composition, *Welcome to Bonkers* as well as *No One Survives*, *Powercore*, and *We Need a Gimmick* are available RIGHT NOW.

So what are you waiting for? Take a listen below!
