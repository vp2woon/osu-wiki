The government knows you've been craving this. **KNOWER** joins the lineup as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/48/header.jpg)

Rising to fame in the osu! community with their panopticon hit *The Government Knows* courtesy of Project Loved and other subsequent sets, the cult of **KNOWER** has been on the up and up. You might already be familiar with some of their work from games like *Grand Theft Auto V* and more recently, *Beat Saber*.

Campy, quirky and stuffed full of a frankly absurd amount of funk, we're delighted to welcome **KNOWER** aboard as the latest Featured Artist, complete with some familiar favorites, a fresh selection from their latest album *Life*, and a few tracks from *Let Go*.

Here's a sample of just a few:

**13** spectacular new tracks await you over on their [Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/48), all pre-timed and ready for your modding and mapping adventures. Totally worry free for use in osu!, by the way.

We're still keeping steady with the insane pace we set ourselves a few months ago, and there's no sign of things slowing down! In a little bit of an early hint, we have a huge batch of updates for our existing Featured Artists slated later on in the month, but as for next release...

Well, we've been chalking it out, and I think we're really going above and beyond on this next one. It's something extra vivid.

But what does it all mean? Find out in ten days time! Or try to guess in the comments for the grand prize of being able to brag to your friends about it.
