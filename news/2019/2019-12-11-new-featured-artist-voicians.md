We're proud to welcome **Voicians** as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/59/header.jpg)

**Voicians** is a German electronic music producer with a hugely storied history of collaboration and releases across half a dozen major labels, like *Hospital Records*, *Liquicity Records*, *NoCopyrightSounds* and more. If you've ever listened to anything from NCS, you've almost certainly had a taste of **Voicians** talent, and we're super excited to bring him aboard formally.

Fans of *Pendulum* and *Celldweller* will find a hint of kindred sound in **Voicians** work, so make sure to pop in and have a look!

We've got a choice selection of ten tracks from his widely varied lineup for your beatmapping adventures, check a few out:
