We're proud to welcome underground producer **False Noise** as our latest addition to the Featured Artist roster!

Rising to prominence in osu! during early 2017 via the [*Skyshards*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/606995) collaborative map by [Shiirn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/465126) and [Mir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8688812), **False Noise** has been something of a cult sensation among the mapping scene for his incredibly unique and compelling musical flavour, fusing elements of drum and bass and stylistic licks from all across electronica.

We've managed to snag **11** tracks from his wide catalogue of sound, including *Skyshards*, *Serpentine* and *Kek*, bringing people the **False Noise** they know and love, with a sprinkling of extra tracks as well.

Take a listen for yourself and see what all the hype's about:

As always, the above tracks and all the others are immediately available from [**False Noise**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/52) for modding and mapping, no fuss, and 100% free.

This now leaves us with this week's newest dilemma: the ominous *hint* of our next release to come. Toy's got the reins on this one, so I'll leave it to him:

*You wake up in a dark room. The pungent stench of blight and mildew fills your lungs as you fiddle around for a light switch.*

*You flip the power on, rejuvenating the light bulb's core.*

*A lone spider spins an immaculate web in the windowsill—a harsh contrast to the hundreds of corpses that lay waste beyond the silk dream-catcher.*

*Distant figures celebrate, chugging alcohol and blaring music.*

*"What are those things? Trolls?" you mutter, mind racing, trying to recall anything about their arrival.*

*You catch a green speck dart behind you. "We're better."*

But what does this all mean? Spooky! Find out next week!
