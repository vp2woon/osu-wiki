Dashing in from geometric fame, **Creo** bursts into the scene as osu!'s latest Featured Artist!

We're proud to announce the latest addition to the Featured Artist lineup - [**Creo**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/36)! Rising to fame in the *Geometry Dash* scene with his track *Dimension*, we just couldn't say no to **Creo**'s wonderful fusion of pumping, melodic EDM underscored with more classic instrumentation.

From the pounding beats of *Nautilus* to the wild frontier tunes of tracks like *Outlaw* and frantic, in-your-face pieces like *Dune*, **Creo**'s work is wonderfully varied and sure to satisfy anyone familiar with the EDM hits we all know and love, while sporting a beautiful difference all of their own.

Here's a small sample from the **17** tracks we've nabbed for your mapping pleasure, all available over at [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/36):

We're excited to see what people create with **Creo**'s work - the *Geometry Dash* community has had a blast with his music, and we're sure you guys will, too.

The Featured Artist project continues to grow by the month - it won't be long now before we've breached over a thousand tracks from more than nearly three dozen artists. Crazy, huh?
