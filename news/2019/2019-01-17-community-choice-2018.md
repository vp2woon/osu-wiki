It's time to take a look at 2018 in retrospect, and decide which 10 maps from each game mode will become the highly vaunted Community Favourites!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-01-17-community-choice-2018/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/74)

Here's how all this goes down:

Every player gets **10 votes per game mode** to cast for their most adored **ranked** maps of 2018 **that they have played at least once**. Any maps you're eligible to vote on will *automagically* show up in the voting listing.

Find your favorite maps in the running for a given game mode, click them once to shoot them a star of intense approval, and you're done! Easy as that.

The highest voted map from each mode will earn the timeless title of Community Favourite of 2018, and its mapper will score **an exclusive new profile badge, plus 6 months of osu!supporter for their hard-earned efforts.**

The remaining maps in the top 10 for each mode will also have their respective mappers receive **3 months of osu!supporter** to commemorate their work.
