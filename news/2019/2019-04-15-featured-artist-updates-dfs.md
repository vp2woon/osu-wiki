We're getting down to earth with some brand new tracks from artists you know and love - namely the Monolithia album from Fractal Dreamers, two new tracks from Dictate, and six songs from sakuraburst!

In an ongoing commitment to keep the Featured Artist library as fresh as possible, we've been touching base with many of the artists in the lineup over the past few months, and have snagged some spicy additions to the library from their latest work.

As with all Featured Artist tracks, these new additions are 100% free for use in mapping and modding within osu!, no ifs or buts. Worry less and map more!

## Dictate

Featuring *Moth* from [**Dictate**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/21)'s contribution to the collab album [MELTDOWN](https://soundcloud.com/renrakuglobalmedia/sets/va-meltdown-free-download) and *Secede* from some of his more personal experiments, there's something both familiar and fresh in this bite-sized update.

Back in style and doing what they do best, the latest release from [**Fractal Dreamers**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/15) is none other than *Monolithia*, an album featuring a classic and continual evolution of their unique sound.

They go fast, and they go *hard*, in that classic way that only Fractal Dreamers knows how to pull off. There are **8** tracks from Monolithia to choose from, so make sure to check out their listing for the full details!

## sakuraburst

One of the earliest creators to have joined the Featured Artist project, [**sakuraburst**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/8) has been hard at work for years now developing his highly renowned sound.

We've managed to snag a three-track selection from his highly acclaimed *HARPSINGER SINGLES*—pieces that masterfully straddle the divide between emotive, instrumental expression and that stark, electronic brilliance that he is renowned for.

On top of that, we've also got a brand new piece in *SELF DESTRUCT*, a collab track between him and hyleo in *Galaxy Cutter*, and something a little different in *AETHERSONG*. Check them all out!
