Ever wanted to get into beatmapping for this game, but have no clue where to start? In that case, the Community Mentorship program might be the way to begin your mapping career!

This program serves as a platform for new mappers and modders to get into the beatmapping process more quickly. They'll be teaming up with more experienced mappers and modders in the community that will show them the ropes for a total of ten weeks.

Mentor applications are already over, but if mentoring someone in a more structured manner sounds interesting, you should look to apply next cycle! On the other hand, mentee applications are just about to open. If you want to get into mapping and are willing to learn, now's the time to apply!

**For the upcoming spring cycle, we are looking for both mentors and mentees for all game modes!**

The timeline is as follows (all opening and closing dates start and end at midnight UTC+0):
- Mentor signups started on 2019-01-06 and close on 2019-01-13.
- Mentee signups will open on 2019-01-27 and close on 2019-02-06.
- The 2019 spring cycle will start on 2019-02-10 and end on 2019-04-21.

During this time, the internal organization team will host a variety of events on the Discord server, such as mapping contests, modding puzzles, or even just things like multiplayer lobbies with integrated feedback sessions! Some mentors also hold lectures from time to time that are accompanied or followed by an open round of questions from the mentees. A compendium of those can be found over at [this thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/851923). If lectures and all aren't for you and you're more of a do-it-yourself person, [this thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/514122) collects a lot of mapping puzzles that have been created within the scope of this program to mess around with yourself!

If you or anyone you know might be interested in applying, go ahead and check out the [forum announcement and rule thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/851923)!

We're looking forward to the next generation of mentors and mentees!
