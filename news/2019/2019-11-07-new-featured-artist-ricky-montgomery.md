Those among us who were avid watchers of *Vine* back before it died an untimely death might be familiar with **Ricky Montgomery** or his recent double features at the top of the iTunes Rock and Alternative charts.

We love having a variety of sounds and genres in our lineup, and we're certain that he'll scratch the itch of anyone looking for something a little more vocal and rock oriented.

But as always, don't take our word for it, give these a listen:
