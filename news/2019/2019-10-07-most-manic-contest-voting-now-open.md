The creators among us have really stepped up and put forward a huge variety of wildly varying concepts for us to chew over.

And chew we shall! Everyone has **8 votes** to cast for their favourite picks, so [head on over to the Most Manic Art Contest listing now and cast yours!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/80)

As stated in the initial contest article, the top 3 entries as voted by you will snag their authors **6 months, 3 months, and 2 months** of osu!supporter respectively.

We (being the osu!team) will sit down together and convene once the voting is done to choose the entry we feel is most fitting to serve as the primary inspiration for our next mascot rework. The exceptional artist behind that entry shall receive an additional **1 year of osu!supporter**, the coveted **osu!artist** title, and an opportunity to work with us to design the face of an entire game mode for years to come.

What are you waiting for? [Go vote!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/80) The polls will remain open until the 21st of October, so get in soon!
