Over ten thousand people flocked to the polls like an ice cream stand at the beach and threw their votes into the biggest fielding of fan art entries we've ever seen by a large margin. Seriously, the voting was *nuts* this year.

The following entries will all be featured in the game client as the Summer 2019 seasonal background pack henceforth, and their superbly talented artists have nabbed themselves **2 months of osu!supporter** for coming out on top despite the incredible heat. Summer puns notwithstanding, everybody did a great job this year. Seriously. Awesome stuff.

Let's get right into the winners!

Snaring the hearts of **6052** voters, [**Sunako**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2801166)'s delightfully adorable rendition of flagship mascots pippi and Mocha enjoying some natural sun was a frontrunner from the very start.

Sunako continues to impress with her amazing entries and top-scoring cuteness creation. Amazing stuff!

If the top three so far are anything to go off, it's that summer isn't always about the swimsuits!

**3469** voters craved a visit to the beach, and [**KrisyYy**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7266506) gladly delivered with their boba-wielding pippi and pouting Aiko enjoying the summer sun to the maximum. You can really feel the glare from this one. Get it?

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-08-08-summer-2019-fanart-contest-results/VoidSynatic.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/79/winners/VoidSynatic.png)

Speaking of travel, **3311** voters approved of [**VoidSynatic**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8270353)'s take on Aiko, Tama and Mocha taking the ppy-express to sunlit lands elsewhere. What sort of adventures will the Taiko triplets get up to, I wonder?

Stylish swimsuits abound in [**MSGZ**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7145880)'s entry, with **3291** voters liking very much what they saw. Tasteful frills are a thing of wonder, aren't they?

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-08-08-summer-2019-fanart-contest-results/Ryniix.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/79/winners/Ryniix.png)

**2879** voters tried to tell [**Ryniix**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9920889)'s rendition of pippi to keep an eye on her popsicle, but it was too little, too late! Oh, well.  It isn't as if anyone is complaining about the sight after the fact!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-08-08-summer-2019-fanart-contest-results/Ireiisu.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/79/winners/Ireiisu.png)

**2859** voters were stunned by [**Ireiisu**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5191022)'s magnificent take on our two most popular mascots, only to find they'd been visited instead by the most feared being in the osu! cinematic universe: the 1x Miss Crab. Or just Miss Crab for short.

**2844** voters universally declared that [**Weakestt**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7721841)'s entry was in fact, rather strong! Much like the sunlight assailing our dearest pippi. Remember to wear sunscreen!

**2829** people lit up the skies of [**yuumio**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11246394)'s world in adoration for their festive take on one of our most underrated mascots, Maria.

Complete of course, with a tiny pippi and Mocha crawling all over her. Fitting, given she's the eldest of the bunch!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-08-08-summer-2019-fanart-contest-results/Charrmy.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/79/winners/Charrmy.png)

Clear, cool skies charmed **2706** voters in [**Charrmy**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13133923)'s summery spectacle, featuring a sunglasses-wearing pippidon and the OG mascot herself chilling about in glistening waters.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-08-08-summer-2019-fanart-contest-results/Arind.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/79/winners/Arind.png)

**2586** people squealed at [**Arind**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12116469)'s startled Mocha dropping her balloons mid-way through a waterfight with pippi. Let's be honest, we all know pippi has better aim here.

And now, for a little bit of a sombre moment.

In homage to the recent losses suffered by Kyoto Animation, [**snowyani2000**](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2691590) has worked with us to create a tribute piece honouring many of the beloved series produced by the studio that a huge number of us know and love.

To Kyoto Animation, we thank you for all that you have done, and we wish you all the best in these trying times.

Thank you to everyone who participated - this year marks the *biggest* our Fanart contests have ever gotten. So big in fact, that we're thinking we may have to sit down and reassess just how voting will work in the future.

You can check out the full voting tallies [over at the contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/79) if you're interested how it all went down.

The competition for the top-scoring spots was the fiercest it has ever been, and we hope to see more of you wonderfully talented people square up for the future contests as well!

From all of us here at the osu!team, we hope you enjoy your summer (or local season of choice) wherever you may be. We'll be back in a couple of months for a new Fan Art contest, so keep your eyes and ears peeled for more info!
