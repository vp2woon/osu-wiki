Delving deeper into the pits of the highly complex and commanding sound of metal and its subgenres, **Inferi** throws wide the gates to the underworld with some of the most intense and commanding tracks seen in the lineup so far.

We're happy to announce *30* fearsome tracks spanning **Inferi**'s three latest albums: from the highly praised concept album *The Path of Apotheosis*, through the nine circles of hell within *Revenant*, to the Rebirth of their 2009 album *The End of an Era*, **Inferi** is a relentless powerhouse within the technical death metal scene.

Already a household name among osu! players craving a more gruesome set of faster-paced maps, take a listen to some previews of what **Inferi** is bringing to the table:
