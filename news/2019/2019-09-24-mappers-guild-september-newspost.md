The Mappers' Guild has been hard at work creating beatmaps for your favourite Featured Artist tracks. If you haven't been following, come check them out!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/mappersguild.png)

Since March 2019, the **[Mappers' Guild](https://mappersguild.com)** has been open to everyone with at least three ranked maps. This has made the Guild very productive in terms of mapping and modding. With the introduction of the quest system, mappers have been more active and interested in mapping Featured Artist content than ever before.

The quests are usually artist-specific, but can sometimes be targeted in nature, such as Vocaloid-themed quests for example, which mixes several artists in one quest. They usually require mappers to produce a given amount of maps, occasionally including extra rules that make quests more diverse.

If you're curious and want to know more about the Guild and its quest system, please visit [the official Mappers' Guild website](https://mappersguild.com)!

There are a lot of completed quests, so here we've picked out the ones involving the most mapsets and mappers. You can find even more Featured Artist content by searching the [beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=featured%20artist)!

Next time, there won't be as many quests, so we'll be able to update you about all of them!

Until then, enjoy playing all of these maps!
