### Can you tell me what this is?

osu!idol is the community driven singing contest! Contestants participate solo or as a duet in multiple stages consisting of various genres, showcasing what they got to our panel of judges. They will evaluate the performances and determine who makes it through the stages, eventually ending up in the finals. Voting for the winner will be conducted by you, the community, to decide who will be the next osu!idol!

### So what do I do?

Record a clip around 30 seconds long of your best singing with no background music added. Submissions will be lasting all month long, so give us the best you got!

### What's in it for me?

Once community voting has concluded, the finalists will be receiving these prizes as followed:

- **1st:** osu!idol 2019 winner profile badge + 6 months supporter tag
- **2nd:** 3 months supporter tag
- **3rd:** 1 month supporter tag
