## How do I register?

- **[Click here to sign-up!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/20)**
- Do not create teams in advance! Teams will be formed by the country's team captain after the registration phase has concluded.
- Ensure you submit your registration before the **11th of June**!

Please note - you may only participate if your **osu!catch global ranking is #5000 or higher, and have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months**.

If your registration successfully passes our evaluation, you will be put on the candidate list for your country. Whenever a captain for your country has been assigned, the list of eligible players will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

_Remember that registrations submitted past the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances - ensure your registrations are completed early to avoid any last-minute issues!_
