The results are in, and it's close! TOO CLOSE! Only **THREE** votes distinguish second place from third place, my goodness. Read on for more details!

Surprise surprise, the voting was nearly impossible again, as it tends to be whenever our incredible community artists are involved. 85 brave artists took the plunge, but there could only be three winners of the grand vote, except...

Except there's no way we could settle for just the top three!

In the interests of rewarding excellent work well done, we've decided to shift the rewards for winning the public vote to include everyone from third place onwards with a tidy month of osu!supporter to tide them over for their efforts.

To sum it up, the winner takes home 6 months, second place takes home 3 months, third place takes home 2 months, and 4th onwards to 10th take home one month. Onwards to the results!

Taking home first place with his wonderfully vibrant take on our keyed-in twins-to-be, [**TofuMang**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4817223) nabs the win with **1986** votes.

Simple yet identifiable at a glance, we think that his summery concession to a warmer palette instead of osu!mania's typical cooler oranges was a bold move, and exactly the kind of experimentation we were hoping to see.

Trailing just behind at **1830** votes, [**Hecatia's**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8244635) Nana and Shin captivated a score of onlookers with their ribbon-laced charm.

We fully expect to see these two out in force during Fan Art contests in the future.

In perhaps the closest result in any art contest we've held so far, [**crystalsuicune**'s](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9974) Mani and Max stormed into the top three with **1827** votes.

No strangers to crystalsuicune's work, we were delighted to see them taking another go after designing Tama, whom to this day, remains the favourite piece of one unnamed person who writes these articles.

Now, to be extra clear, the results of this contest **do not mean that the first place entry is the new set of osu!mania twins.**

Faced with the near impossible task of deciding from this incredible deluge of talent, the osu!team must now retreat to the mountains in order to decide upon the fated artist of the ages, the one whom has impressed us collectively the most to have their concept made into reality as the official osu!mania game mode mascots.

Please also understand that we are at liberty to choose *anyone* from the contest running regardless of their place in the final scoring, though we will absolutely factor in the popularity of the design as one of the elements we consider.

We'll do our best to be timely on the matter, but we ask for your patience as we undergo deliberations.

In the meanwhile, we'd like to thank everyone who voted, and also everyone who sent in an entry - it's never easy during the month of the blood moon, where many communities vie for their artist's attention!
