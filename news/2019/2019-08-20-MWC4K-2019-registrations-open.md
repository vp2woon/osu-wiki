## How do I register?

- **[Click here to sign-up!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/21)**
- Do not create teams in advance! Teams will be formed by the country's team captain after the registration phase is concluded.
- Hand in your registration before the **3rd of September.**

Please note that you may only participate if you are of a **osu!mania global ranking of #5000 or higher and have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months**.

If your registration successfully passes our evaluation, you will be put on the candidate list for your country. Whenever a captain for your country is assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

_Remember that any registrations past the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances - so get your registrations done early to avoid any last-minute issues._
