Spotlights rivals assemble! As many of you might've already known, the Autumn Season 2020 is over, and after a little bit of a delay, we're finally here to announce the start of the **Winter Season** for 2021!

While we didn't change any essential things regarding league-aspect or general gameplay, we're working to ensure this season works a little more smoothly from our side of things, with a focus on communication foremost.

We are also seeking new team members so make sure to check out the **[seeking new curators](#seeking-new-curators)** section if you'd be interested in helping out!

If you just can't wait to try out the new maps, **the Beatmap Spotlights lobbies are now open for play on the osu!lazer client**. If you've got no idea how to get started with things, read on below!

## How to participate in Beatmap Spotlights League?

To participate in the Beatmap Spotlights League, you need to download the latest version of osu!lazer client from [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/latest). Once you're done installing and logging in to your account, head on over to the playlists tab in the play section and find the Spotlights lobbies as denoted by a little pink bar.

## Seeking new curators

We are looking for members that are both willing and capable of making decent beatmap selections for upcoming Beatmap Spotlights seasons.

**If you think you've got what it takes to be a part of Spotlights Team, don't hesitate and [apply today!](https://spotlights.team/app)**

The applications will remain open for at least 2 weeks (ending at 1st February 2021).

## Mappers of the Season

After each season has finalized, the curators will handpick a mapper featured in the Beatmap Spotlights map pool for each gamemode and declare them as the best mapper of the season, netting them a tidy **3 months of osu!supporter** for their efforts.

To kick things off, we're formally presenting the best of Autumn Season 2020 as chosen by our curators:

- osu!: [TAROLIN feat. Katakiri Rekka - Cardinal Rave \[Cub's Insane\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1116399#osu/2355610) by [Cubby](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10914582)

Congratulations to those who won! We're hoping to see such great creations in future seasons as well!

## The Future

The new Beatmap Spotlights is still a project on its early development stage and depends a lot on community feedback and engagement to improve. Many things can (and will) change for future seasons, and it all depends on *your* feedback!

What do you want for the next season? What needs to be fixed? What are your opinions on the current system? You can voice out all your opinions [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1225797) and we will keep note of every suggestion, so please let us know how you feel about things.

We do hope you have enjoyed the Autumn Season 2020 Spotlights, and, of course, we do hope that you enjoy the Winter Season even more.

See you in the upcoming timeshift lobbies!
