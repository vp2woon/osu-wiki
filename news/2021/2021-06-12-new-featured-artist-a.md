**A?** hops in as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/173/header.jpg)

"Wouldn't it be cool to play an osu! map of my own music?" is a question surely every player has considered at some point. Few people actually go the extra mile to make it happen though, one example being J-core/breakcore producer **A?**, also known as Aquestion or [A__](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12011880) on osu!.

Putting their osu!taiko experience to the test, **A?** grew a name for themselves through a vast collection of remixes that eventually expanded into the realm of original works. Each of their songs packs both insane energy and complex rhythms that likely come naturally to someone well versed in rhythm games.

We're proud to introduce **7** of **A?**'s blood-pumping tracks, all of which can be found on [their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/173)!

Hungering for a taste? **A?**'s 1/4 and 1/6-filled song [*Arrogation*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=arrogation) is a solid start for both osu! and osu!taiko audiences. Take a peek at that through the video below and review the rest of these samples:

Believe it or not, everything above and more can be found over at [**A?**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/173). There's even a chance they're pre-timed and ready for mapping too, but you shouldn't trust us on that. Maybe check for yourself.

"What's coming next", you ask? Could it be another Featured Artist? The only way to know is by checking in on [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) every once in a while (or coming back here next Wednesday). In any case, we'll see you soon!
