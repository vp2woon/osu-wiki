Having endured the agony of having to pick through **117** entries with only **12** votes to pass around, you've all earned the right to sit back and enjoy some quality Seasonal backgrounds to usher in the end of the year.

Without any further waffling, let's get straight into this year's finalists:

*As usual, you can click on any of the banner images to be taken to a high-resolution version of the entry without the osu! cookie!*

Fanart contest regular [**Dem4eg-**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7206818) won over **4836** voters with a timid pippi offering a festive tithe of osu!supporter and a pen tablet all neatly adorned with a ribbon.

Simple, clean, and a frontrunner in the voting from the very start of the contest, Dem4eg- joins the lineup of hallowed fanart finalists for the first time with a real stonker of an entry, no less. Congratulations!

**4685** approved of [**lutfi_anims**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11041959)'s depiction of pippi and Mocha catching a moment in the snow beneath a bare winter tree. Facial expression takes front and center in this one, showing you what the community's really looking for when they vote!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/eulorie.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/eulorie.png)

[**eulorie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/20349380)'s winter wonderland enchanted **4500** voters with promises of smores and adorable outfits in equal measure, toting a festively handsome pippi and a most adorable Chirou with a Mocha backpack to boot!

The overall vibes of this artwork are really something else, and hearken back to the days of old MMORPG festive loading screens like Ragnarok Online, if anybody reading these newsposts is even of the age to remember these games any more. What a piece!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/Tin_Can.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/Tin%20Can.png)

[**Tin Can**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10682807)'s take on a smiling pippi warming herself up with an osu!-brand hot drink earned the approval of **4497** voters, all while Mocha and a don take to ice skating off elsewhere in shot.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/Dreamxiety.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/Dreamxiety.png)

[**Dreamxiety**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233) is back at it again with **3982** voters thoroughly impressed by a doge-toting pippi enjoying a moment whilst Aiko and Chirou build a snowman in a rather scenic wintry vista. Simply superb, as always!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/handakote.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/handakote.png)

[**handakote**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23188287)'s undeniable style snared **3839** voters with Mocha and pippi both toting very stylish winter outfits with a splash of floral accent. It's all in the eyes, baby!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/ShovelKun.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/ShovelKun.png)

**3765** voters were impressed to see [**ShovelKun**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9948284) delve into a festive urban style with an aloof pippi and unmistakably cute Mocha posing for the camera before a muted cityscape.

Excellent use of colour and contrast in this one really makes the whole thing pop, and the votes are the proof!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/DGen.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/DGen.png)

**3454** voters could not resist the warmth of [**DGen**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13290907)'s most festive entry, showcasing a snug pippi and dozing Chirou enjoying season-appropriate treats before a raging campfire. The tree's decorated with 1-2 patterns and slider baubles, too. Very fitting considering most of them come from a farm.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/SvenJing.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/SvenJing.png)

Frigid elegance presides with [**SvenJing**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11215996)'s depiction of an ice-wielding pippi in a frozen landscape. **3341** voters were impressed by this artistic twist on the contest theme, and so should you!

Always a pleasure to see artists pushing the envelope beyond the normal!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/RedcXca.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/RedcXca.png)

[**RedcXca**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14056601)'s take on three camping mascots (mostly) enjoying some campfire warmth earned **3335** votes. If you saw pippi, Chirou, Aiko and a don all sitting around a fire, what would you do?

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/157.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/157.png)

[**157**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9315038) introduces some new years flair to **3321** votes of approval with a yukata-clad Mocha set before a firework-lit cityscape. Beautiful use of colour and reflection really brings out the details in this piece, which multiply the longer you look.

...is that a pencil dog?

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/ZunK.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/ZunK.png)

**3178** could not resist the allure of [**ZunK**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1070783)'s simmering winter stew, complete with crying fish. There's also an absurdly cute drooling Mocha and inquisitive pippi all rugged up in winterwear, too!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/McFriedFries.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/McFriedFries.png)

Creating a shot for the ages, **3106** cheered on [**McFriedFries**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12694139)'s piece depicting a lounging pippi before a sea of flying candlelit lanterns. What a scene!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/TJ_25.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/TJ_25.png)

[**TJ_25**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18470896)'s Alisa and pippi distributed **2979** gifts and got as many votes in return from excited viewers eager to see a few of their favourite references, such as the venerable 1-2 and the Funny Number.

Something else is going on in this one, you say? No idea what you're talking about.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/Kwms024.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/Kwms024.png)

[**Kwms024**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11516014) passed out **2594** leaflets for an osu! ramen shop with oodles of New Year's flair (and toppings), showcasing a very unique take on the boundaries of the contest theme.

osu!supporters even enjoy a special 50% discount! Classic ramen soup for only $3.635, what a bargain!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/7thDeath.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/7thDeath.png)

[**7thDeath**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18656961) impressed **2328** snowflakes with a simple but undeniably cute rendition of both pippi and Chirou taking a wintry stroll in festive attire. Very nice!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/JoakiKun.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/JoakiKun.png)

**2114** could not resist the charm of [**JoakiKun**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10894420)'s winter-clad pippi and Mocha, especially when the former is sporting very fashionable cat-don earmuffs.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/lilylmao.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/lilylmao.png)

**1939** raised a toast to [**lilylmao**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25130329)'s beautifully concise rendition of an upbeat pippi welcoming in 2022 to fireworks with a beverage in hand. Cheers!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/araran.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/araran.png)

[**araran**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8937198) and **1868** voters summoned forth the hidden kitsune shrine-maiden pippi, spoken about only in the ancient tomes of deep osu! lore.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/banners/Ztalx.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/136/winners/Ztalx.png)

[**Ztalx**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7614399) took off into the skies to **1809** votes, with all the mainline mascots and some crowd favourites in tow to deliver the world's supplies of festive presents.
