The time is now. Start your mapping journey (or just play some cool maps) with our latest Featured Artist **Kurubukko**!

The one and only artist in the rhythm game kingdom who proudly presents themselves as a "cute poop", **Kurubukko** is a Japanese producer known for electronic soundscapes reminiscent of ruins and space. As a long-time participant in *BMS OF FIGHTERS* and a musician influenced by all matters of electronica, it's no wonder that **Kurubukko**'s masterpieces have been front and center in games like *SOUND VOLTEX*, *MUSECA*, and *CHUNITHM*.

Keen eyes may remember that we picked up a super popular collaborative track between **Kurubukko** and [yukitani](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/167) a few months ago: [Minamichita EVOLVED](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/136632).

**Kurubukko**'s solo songs are just as awesome, so give them a peek from [their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/217)!

Looking for a fresh taste of **Kurubukko**'s sound? We've organized a few [showcase beatmaps](/wiki/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_showcase_beatmaps) for your circle crushing desires, so witness some frames-per-second-pain through the video below, or play the maps for yourself!

If you're reading this, it means you're not choosing your favourite track from [**Kurubukko**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/217). It seems like the allure of pre-timed beatmap templates isn't enough for you, so you might need to convert your circle-clicking time to [link-clicking time](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/217).

Please don't be alarmed. We have some devastating news: **we won't be announcing a new Featured Artist this Saturday.**

It'll be on Sunday instead! Apologies in advance to all 4 of you who track time through our ultra-consistent Featured Artist announcements. Send your complaints to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) and we'll see you soon!
