### osu!mania

- **[Allow ranking 10-Key beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1285594)**: This long-awaited change for the osu!mania community finally brings 10-key maps into the limelight, making them rankable for the first time ever.

A new red-name appeared out of nowhere! [Zelq](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8953955) has decided to join the red crusade after two years as a BN and will support the NAT from now on by assisting in keeping things running in tip-top shape. Welcome to the team, Zelq!

What's better than one new red-name? Of course, two of them! [Agatsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5579871) has ascended to the NAT after roughly a year and a half as a Beatmap Nominator. With the same mission as Zelq, Agatsu has rolled up his sleeves to work alongside the NAT to better the mapping and modding community. Welcome aboard, Agatsu!

## BN and QAT/NAT Badges

It has been quite a while since we last covered recent badge additions in the Mappers' Report, so bear with us as the list will be a little bit longer this time.

All of those listed below have been longstanding contributors to the Beatmap Nominators or the NAT at large, and we're very thankful for their efforts and drive to help keep osu! awesome.

## Mappers' Showcase

This month in the Mappers' Showcase, we'll be featuring two hidden gems from the drum-basher's game mode of choice, osu!taiko!

A big thank you goes out to the showcase selectors for this issue, namely [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976) and [radar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7131099)!

### Maimaing

A newer yet very promising mapper, [Maimaing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14520910) has quickly caught on to the particulars of mapping and has been something of a rising star from the moment he started delving into the editor in late 2020.

His name quickly started spreading among the Japanese community and later into the general scene upon his first steps towards the ranked section, particularly with his very first ranked beatmap, [PSYQUI - Hype feat. Such (lapix Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1316175). This well-crafted map features fascinating rhythms and patterning, creating an experience that really does the song justice and is great to play as well.

Another event that highlights his ever-growing potential is his inclusion in the custom mappers roster for the osu!taiko World Cup 2021 as a DT mapper for the Group Stage. Thus, he took the opportunity to bring the v-tuber atmosphere to the TWC in the form of [hololive IDOL PROJECT - SHIJOSHUGI ADTRUCK](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1387197), offering a challenging and entertaining experience that is sure to test the finger control skills of those brave enough to try.

While he still has a long way to reach his full potential, it will be quite fascinating to see how Maimaing will develop as a mapper later on. He's always trying something new, so make sure to check out his other works, and maybe subscribe to this profile if you're interested enough in what he'll make next.

### X a v y

A mapper whose popularity has been on the rise among high-level players, [X a v y](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3738344) burst into the ranked section for the first time in early 2021 with [Houshou Marine - Ahoy!! Warera Houshou Kaizokudan\*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1282787), a marathon version of a pirate v-tuber's debut song.

Though this might've been his first foray into ranked, X a v y's beatmap graveyard is all but crammed full of a massive catalogue of challenging maps, so make sure to give it a look if you fancy yourself up to the occasion!

All that being said, even the more casual drum-rollers among us will find he still has quite a lot to offer! Those interested should check out [Yuiphex - My Red H3ad Girl](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1407922) and [Jouhoushori-bu - Setsuna Iro (tamame's EZC remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1381626), both of which feature well-structured lower difficulties that reflect some serious skill in catering not just to high-end players, but also to newer ones as well.

We're very excited to see what X a v y will produce in the coming months and hope to see his dedication forge him into a truly excellent mapper!

## Mapping Contests

Feeling up for some competition, but find yourself yearning for mapping over playing? Search no more - we've got several contests up on offer this month, so read on to find out all about them!

### Hyperpop Beatmapping Contest

Do you like Hyperpop music and enjoy clicking or placing circles? Then we have just the perfect contest for you: the [Hyperpop Beatmapping Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1283577)! This osu! mapping contest aims to introduce more mappers to the underrated music genre known as Hyperpop. Never heard of it? No problem! The registrations are up until the **April 11th**, so duck on in and give it a look to see what all the fuss is about.

Of course, all good contests come with even better rewards! First place nabs themselves a shiny new badge for their osu! profile plus together with 3 months of osu! supporter, while second and third get a bit of osu!supporter as well for their efforts.

### A Labour of Love: Voting Open

Remember the [Labour of Love](/wiki/Contests/A_Labour_of_Love_Contest) contest? The community vote has been live for over a week now, with eight teams squaring off to fight for your two votes.

The voting won't be open for much longer, so make sure to check them all out and vote for your favorite. You can find all the submissions and download them on the [Labour of Love contest page](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/115).

We're excited to see who will take the trophy home!

## Around the Community

Last but certainly not least, here's a rundown of all the other mapping and modding related projects that are going on in the community at the moment:

### Community Mentorship Program Spring 2021

The Mentorship program is back with another cycle! Are you interested in mapping but have no idea where to start? Or, are you looking for people to convey your ingenious mapping techniques? The [Community Mentorship Program](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1273766) is exactly what you are looking for.

In this program, experienced mappers are allocated groups of people to tutor on both basic and advanced beatmapping concepts. Whether it is osu!, osu!taiko, osu!catch or osu!mania, the program has mapping mentors from every game mode, and many of the more recently popular mappers have been participants in the program in the past.

While the mentor signups have already been closed, the mentee signups will open on **April 19th** and will remain up until **April 25th**. Take a look at the project and save the date, it could be your big break into the scene!

If you have ever wanted to learn how to map, do not waste this chance and sign up now! You can find all the vital information in the forum thread linked above.

### Advanced beatmap search is here!

As a bit of extra news, we're excited to highlight a recent change to the [beatmap listing page](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets), which now finally supports advanced searching functions similar to what you can use in-game.

You can now search for beatmaps ranked in a specific year using special shorthand syntax by using things like `ranked=2010`. You may also search for specific keys for osu!mania beatmaps, via `keys=7`.

A complete list of possible search options can be found on the [Interface wiki page](/wiki/Client/Interface#search).

### dsco's Guide to Making and Ranking the First Mapset

If you have ever wondered how a beatmap is created from scratch and carried all over to the ranked section, you're in luck, because esteemed mapper and modder [dsco](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4330511) has livestreamed for over 9 hours in order to guide his viewers through the entire process from start to finish with his set for [Litku Klemetti - Jaakuningatar (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1421834).

This rare insight into the entire ranking process is not something that is done particularly often, especially in not so dedicated a format. If you're interested in picking up the essentials of mapping, modding and ranking, be sure to give this one a look.

Here's a vod of the stream that compiles all aspects of mapping in 9 hours:

And that's it for the March issue of the Mappers' Report!

Should you know anything mapping or modding related, be it guides, podcasts or videos, let us know. We would love to touch upon them in the next issue of Mappers' Report!

You can either directly contact [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717) or drop by in the `#mappers-report` channel on the [osu! community Discord server](https://discord.gg/0Vxo9AsejDkGlk3H).

Hope to see you there soon. Thank you for reading, stay safe and healthy!
