Channeling a new species of music, **SEBii** invades the Featured Artist lineup!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/186/header.jpg)

Boasting a self-produced style in his own realm of pop and hip hop, Chinese-American creator **SEBii** is renowned for his distinct stylization (both musically and visually) and his unaltered high-pitched vocals. After moving from China to the United States as a teen, **SEBii** released a wide spread of music that managed to simultaneously connect with niche scenes and ever-expansive TikTok audiences — most notably through the track *Play Poker Remix (w/ Maple)*.

We've pulled **6** tracks from **SEBii**'s insanely impressive catalogue, all of which can be found on [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/186)!

Looking for a sample of **SEBii**'s music? "Yes" is the correct answer. Check out [the map that brought **SEBii** to osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1391589) through the somehow lyrically relevant feet-gameplay video below, then explore the rest of the previews:
