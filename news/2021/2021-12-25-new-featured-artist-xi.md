Yep, it's **xi**.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/727/header.jpg)

Usually we'd write some stuff here to hype up how cool this artist is, but like... do we even need to?

Let's be honest. If you've ever clicked a circle, you know who **xi** is. [FREEDOM DiVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/39804) has been the go-to beatmap for high BPM streams for nearly a decade and [Blue Zenith](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/292301) has cursed generations of osu! players through the existence of a simple 3 digit number.

It's absurd how much of osu!'s history is built around **xi**'s piano-based musical prowess, and we're incredibly happy to *finally* have them on board as one of our Featured Artists!

With an artist as monumental as this, we grabbed as much music as we feasibly could. [**xi**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/727) houses **42** tracks in total, including classics and newer pieces alike.

That's enough words. Watch [chocomint](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493) (a.k.a. Cookiezi) set a legendary play that has lived rent-free in everyone's heads for the last 7 years:

Believe it or not, this is only the tip of the iceberg. There's [even more maps of **xi**'s music available to play](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=featured_artist%3D727) that we can't reasonably fit in this overflowing list!

Statistically speaking, it should be preeeeeeetty obvious that **xi**'s music is PERFECT for beatmapping. Once you're done playing all these maps, feel free to create your own artcore masterpiece through any of the beatmap templates on [**xi**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/727)!

And with that, the Featured Artist program will be taking a quick break until 2022.

We'll bring things back with some current Featured Artist updates at the start of next year, then we'll run full-swing back into our usual schedule.

Thanks for sticking with us for all this time. We can assure you that we'll bring *even more* awesome artists to osu! next year.

Stay tuned. :)
