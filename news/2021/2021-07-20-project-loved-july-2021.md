Project Loved is here to cool you off from the summer heat with the freshest picks you've seen yet.

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)

For those unfamiliar, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). These maps are all chosen by the Loved Captains of their respective gamemodes. You can click on each map's banner in this post to go to its poll on the forums, or to view them all on the forum [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process only lasts for 10 days, so make sure that you go vote! More info about this project is available on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved)!

This month, Project Loved will be getting 2 new Captains!

Coming from the osu!taiko Nomination Team, we'd like to welcome [Horiiizon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8071438) to Project Loved! With their experience both in modding maps and as a player, we trust they're going to continue to bring quality maps to the Loved section! Our second captain this month is actually returning after their break from the team. This captain is [_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750), who will be rejoining the osu!mania captain roster!

That's all for the big changes this month, so let's get into the picks for July.

This mapset has been on the Ranked category's doorstep in the past, but with the mapper no longer active, we're showing it some love here in the Loved category. 17 difficulties ranging from 1 to 7 stars, including 11 unique guest difficulties between 5 and 6 stars, leaving much to be explored atop this super catchy and upbeat Camellia song. Most difficulties feature a balanced mix of aim and tech, but they each provide a unique experience — try them out!

*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

A new face to the Loved category, yet no stranger to the game, FlyingTuna has shown yet another skill — creating enjoyable maps.

*Shinsekai Yori* is a high 7\*, 230 BPM stream and aim map, with some alternating patterns scattered throughout. Despite the star rating and description, the map is high octane, regardless of what the upbeat rock music may lead you to believe. This map and the very enjoyable song it's paired with suit each other perfectly with no parts leaving you disappointed — only a smile on your face.

*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

Recently on the uptake, Polkadot Stingray songs have been made into plenty of amazing maps, and *Keshin* is by far no exception.

Difficult 160 BPM, 6.4\* alt aim control, Delis shows their mapping prowess with unconventional flow aim, cut streams, doubles with stacks, all on top of the difficult aim and finger control they require. The entire map leaves an enjoyably difficult yet fair experience, and it leaves you satisfied no matter the score.

*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

Is that the summer heat or is it just me...? *Misirlou* brings some tropical beach tunes to the table, supplying 200 BPM streams, cuts, doubles and even spinners. The map has a 7.4\* difficulty supplying you with the full challenge and experience, as well as a nerfed 6.3\* difficulty, allowing an easier alternative to those who fancy. Despite the unconventional patterns during the 2 minute runtime, it stays fun in Mismagius' own quirky style.

As the dog days continue, a day at the beach may be what you desire.

*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

Although every difficulty in this beatmap stays simple, the 2013 creation date of this rrtyui map lends a lot of charm. The classic BMS mix of *HAELEQUIN* stays true to its roots with simple streams and sliders along with only a few sprinkles of 1/8ths and slider streams. The map has an appealing feel combining them all together — a casual experience no matter what difficulty you decide to play. Compared to all of the high skill cap maps this round, maybe a change of pace might be what you need.

160 BPM, 4:23 | 7.32★\
*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

High velocity sliders, spaced triples and streams alongside alt patterns — you name a pattern and this map has it. On top of a great Cranky vs HiTECH NINJA song, this map stays intense the entire way through. At 160 BPM and 7.3\*, the high star rating for an alt map should display the high difficulty, while also being featured as the Grand Finals map for the North America Tournament. Tricky patterns make the map difficult to combo, yet lend to an entertaining experience which we hope you enjoy.

*slavik goblins* is 2 and a half minutes of nonstop 270 BPM with very few moments to rest, having constant 1/4 bursts from when the map begins until it finishes, this map is sure to be a challenge even to experienced players! The map also features no SV changes and is purely carried by it's solid patterning and fun gameplay which is a testament to how well mapped it is. Hopefully this will pass voting and be **Love**'s first **Loved** beatmap!

*Delta* is popular and played a lot by osu!taiko players. With a BPM of 300, it features 1/4, 1/6 and 1/8 doubles that will come at you relentlessly. In addition, the bar line gimmicks and placement match the song very well, making it a very enjoyable map. If you're an advanced player, or even if you're not confident in your skills, why not play for a pass?

*Maid-chan Yori.* is a popular map that has been circulating since 2018. The song features a sped-up version of a very catchy fast jingle, which features 4 difficulties from prominent mappers at the time of its release. Even though the map stays simple with straightforward usage of scroll speeds, the difficulties use very intuitive patterns that fit the song really well, making the map enjoyable for advanced players.

As if Yorushika's *Itte.* wasn't enough of an emotional roller coaster with its fresh sound that reminds of those long gone youth days, Lzie's remix with that "amen punk" sound matches the characteristics of the song perfectly and so does maguro869's map, with a very fun map that didn't need overly complex patterns or very flashy SV work to capture our hearts, making it one of these hidden gems within the Japanese mapping scene and one maguro869 can sure be proud of as their first potential Loved map!

AutoLs is well-known for their crazy playing skill, but people often overlook the fact that they're skillful at mapping as well. This month we have their map of *Hypnotize* going for Loved, which consists of various technical patterns, such as hypersliders and 1/8 bursts. What stands out from the map is the use of consecutive 1/8 hyperdashes in the map, which makes it more interesting to play as the BPM of 160 might be a bit too slow for some top-notch players. Please check out the map if you're looking for further challenge!

This month going for Loved we have *Kurikaeshi Hitosubu* made by Magiyu, a mapper you might not know as they are a fairly old mapper (and player!)

The map has two difficulties, both of which shouldn't be *too* hard for most players as they are of a fairly low star rating. Both difficulties focus mostly on stair-like patterns which might give you some issues playing through, but are nonetheless very rewarding to play. Give the map a spin and see what you can achieve!

Here we have *Taihen na Mono no Shoushitsu*, which is a mapset hosted by ZHSteven, a long-inactive creator that contributed a lot to osu!catch mapping back in the day. And oh boy, if you thought some of the maps that have been Loved before were old, then this one is ancient. This map was created and last updated in September 2010 (!). However, that does not mean that the difficulties are inherently bad.

For old standards this was pretty good quality compared to most of the other things from around that time. While this mapping style obviously didn't age very well, it is still really fun to play these maps nowadays, as they are challenging in their own way. "catch the yoki" and "Steven's Jumping" are not that easy to play and should be tricky for most players that are not used to these types of styles. "pieguy's CTB" and "Crow'z Lost" on the other hand, are rather easy to play and a good entry point for people who are not that familiar with old mapping.

For real, try some of these diffs, it is definitely worth the time, this is an old gem!

Ding dong, it's that time of month again! Another first timer for Project Loved! This time around we have Shurelia, with their mapset on *Hades:The end*! Shurelia is much more known for their many maps on the regular osu! game mode and their activities as a Global Moderator, but that doesn't mean they should be written off as a mediocre osu!catch mapper (goodness, what a multitalent).

This mapset contains two difficulties - one of them being made by Razor Sharp (which was also featured in 2017's osu!catch World Cup) - that are fairly similar in terms of difficulty. It is the type of map you'd expect from a Yousei Teikoku song, with many triplets accentuating the drums, a handful of streams and a couple of jumps. Being around 6.2+ stars, it is not the easiest of maps, but still definitely well-playable by a good chunk of the playerbase. I personally also believe that this song is/will be *Loved* by many. Yousei Teikoku rocks, eh?

So yeah, check it out, and perhaps vote for this to be Loved, just in case you'd meet Hades in the underworld...

*description written by [Penguinosity](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10235296)*

*Lagtrain* has finally made its way to the Loved section! Player0 created an immediate hit with this cleverly made storyboard map, a map which soon after being uploaded soared all the way to being the #1 most favorited osu!mania chart in the Graveyard section. It's easy to see why this happened, and Player0 really deserves a lot of credit for the coherency they established between this map's storyboard, and the original music video for the song. It's because of this coherency, that the osu!mania Loved captains \*implore\* you all who play this map, to make sure that you follow the instructions at the top of the map's description, and download this map WITH the video and to also use the blank skin provided within the maps folder. This is how you would get the full experience, but with that out of the way let's talk about what Player0 has done with the storyboard and the patterns.

The first thing you'll notice is the monochromatic style of the skin matching the video's aesthetics. Once the chorus hits though, the playfield will teleport about the screen, matching up with the movements of the character. Another thing to mention are the small "X's" strung through all of the main choruses. Hitting these will cause a reticle to appear, which is essentially telling you "Hey... I see you mashing there. Don't do that".

I'll try to keep the rest of this overview brief since it's already getting long, and just list off a number of the other gimmicks to be found with the storyboard: The playfield multiplying, the playfield completely disappearing, changes in scroll direction, increased and decreased size in the playfield, and some small alterations to the noteskin visuals.

The actual note patterns themselves are kept pretty simple, as they really should be, because even with how simplistic they are you'll find all of the difficulty you need just through the map's visuals alone. Let's all thank Player0 for their constant creativity and contributions to this community by showing them just how much we love this map.

\[Crz\]Crysarlene makes their first appearance in Loved voting with *No. 6*, an absolute beast of a long note chart which has gained notoriety among top tier long note players for having extraordinarily technical release patterning.

The chart introduces its main source of difficulty very early on, which is tricky jacks mixed with long notes, some of the most demanding patterns in regards to finger independence for 4K. From then onwards, the map does not hold back for the next four minutes, and in fact raises the difficulty progressively, reaching its densest near-inverse section in the final moments of the song.

Its high difficulty has garnered this chart a large following among high level long note casual and tournament players, earning *No. 6* its spot in the Loved voting section. Please show your support for this map by voting!

Rolling out with another very popular map for this wave, we're bringing you \_Y u r i_'s five-diff set of *We Could Get More Machinegun Psystyle!* by Camellia. Uploaded in March of last year, this set hit it off pretty quickly and gained a heavy amount of traction from osu!mania's playerbase. The reasons for this are easy to see, as the whole trifecta is here. Song choice, approachable patterning, and difficulty spread all play strong factors to bringing sets such as this one into demand.

Talking a bit about Yuri themself though, they've really found a tendency to create some \*very\* popular sets, as they have a healthy habit of including numerous difficulties with everything they make.

Onto this set specifically, the 5 diffs that are here all hold appeal for different kinds of mania players. The "Easy" to "Hard" diffs are providing some slightly altered stages of layering, that are either giving some good introductory levels for newcomers, or some good accuracy fodder to the more accuracy driven crowd. Then with the "Insane" and "Machinegun Psystyle!" diffs, you will see very similar layering and transitions between the two, but with a good number of alterations on the ladder to make it more difficult in comparison. The highest difficulty takes what the Insane does, and ramps up the amount of jacks, hands, and one-handed pattern usage. Another small thing to note is that the from the Hard diff and up, a little SV is added around a quarter way through to add some flair to the break section.

That about wraps this one up. The Loved team just wants to thank Yuri for their hard work in this community, and all of you for voting!

*description written by [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576)*

Despite already being a familiar name to many in the osu!mania community, and as a staple name in other VSRG communities, ilikexd has only started to upload onto osu! within the last year. With their resurfacing popularity among osu!mania players and mappers alike, as well as garnering a handful of high quality Ranked maps in a short timeframe, it only feels fitting that ilikexd earns a spot in Loved voting — and what better map to debut with than *Ripcord*, an instant hit amongst a sizeable portion of the community.

A feels-good technical and accuracy-focused chart, *Ripcord* stands out with its refreshing-to-play bursts and jacks that make the player feel like they're in on the ride with the fast and jittery breakbeats.

With a straightforward high-quality map such as this, it's no surprise that it has been used and subsequently popularized in multiple tournaments. Please show your support for ilikexd and *Ripcord* by voting!

*Bullet Waiting for Me* arrives with a clean keycount spread from 4Key to 7Key!

All four of the diffs are arranged to give a clean, comfortable, and similar feel to unify them together and make what's here feel like a proper, cohesive set. It's because of this that despite the varying keycounts, I feel fine speaking about this set and its patterning as a whole rather than singling out each difficulty out on its own.

Overall, I will say that this set leans towards individuals who fancy more long notes, as all of the diffs here make some use of hybrid patterning up until the main chorus, where then all of the diffs implement full LN usage. As I said before about the uniqueness of this set though, all of the diffs provide some kind of alterations in the patterning to not make everything feel samey, and it's definitely worth commending ATing for.

It's not very often that you see keyspreads done in a way that makes all of the diffs feel unified and it's because of this that the Loved team really feels that this deserves a spot. Let ATing know how good of a job they've done by voting for this set!

*Zouka de Arou to Shita Mono* is a lovely 7K beatmap made by Wilben_Chan. This chart consists of comfortable chordstreams of various density and length, scarcely accompanied by long notes. While there isn't anything considerably spectacular about it, this map is a great and smooth experience for everyone who's up for some vanilla chordstreams. The added rates greatly increase the challenge for more adept 7K players, making the set accessible for many skill levels. Considering the above, *Zouka de Arou to Shita Mono* is a great candidate for Project Loved.

[MAIKA - Goldrop](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/648851#mania) by [Destiny19](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8716749)\

Destiny19 makes their first appearance to the Loved votes with their imaginative long note map, *Goldrop*. Destiny is someone that many 7K players are aware of, as they've been putting out some quality maps for about 4 years at this point. It was a tough decision picking what chart from them we would like to see go up first, but after the deliberation we ended on *Goldrop*. This beautiful song found its way into the Loved section some years ago under Skochan's [4K map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/587117), however the experience that Destiny provides is very different.

Starting off pretty slow, players will feel at ease with the slow and comfortable hybrid-esque patterning, but at the 40-second-mark Destiny hits you with an unapologetic full inverse stair wall to let you know what's to come. Once the chorus begins, so too do the relentless release-focused LN patterns which also work in some stairs, brackets, and even reverse shields all culminating in a very difficult, but strangely comfortable experience. Rinse and repeat what I've said before until around 3:30, where Destiny decides you're getting too comfortable, and slaps you with a full inverse bracket wall that even works in 16th snapped bursts. Although this spike only lasts about 10 seconds, it's one hell of a punch and it's definitely something that players need to watch out for when playing this.

That about does it for all of what I have to say about the chart — it's just a very well-constructed and enjoyable experience, and anybody who enjoys it should definitely go and check out the other maps that Destiny has made if you haven't already. Cast your vote now!
