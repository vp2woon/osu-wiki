**m108** joins the ranks as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/161/header.jpg)

Stepping into the limelight is **m108**, a Japanese producer who's been making a name for himself in the rhythm game scene since 2008 with a fiercely energetic sound. With inspirations drawn from a whole breadth of sources like chiptune songs, classical pieces and other rhythm game tracks, his style takes familiar sounds and morphs them into his own tonal brand.

We've snagged **11** tracks for the today's haul, including *Crow Solace* from 2012's *BMS OF FIGHTERS* event — the song that really put **m108** on the map.

Speaking of maps, cool dudes from the [Mappers' Guild](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild) have been grinding out [showcase maps](/wiki/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_showcase_beatmaps) specifically for this announcement! Play through any of those to experience **m108**'s sound for yourself, or listen to his song *Sunflower* in the world's longest distance liveplay video below:
