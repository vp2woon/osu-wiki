We're proud to pull **LV.4** into our Featured Artist collection!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/214/header.jpg?2023)

**LV.4** has been producing legendary trance hits since the year 2000 — longer than you've been alive. Probably.

After receiving endless praise for his song *Angel Dust* in *BOF2006*, **LV.4**'s style became a mainstay in the world of rhythm games. He's been featured in games like *Taiko no Tatsujin*, *CHUNITHM*, *ONGEKI*, and *SOUND VOLTEX*, each of which showcase **LV.4**'s high note density at the forefront.

**19** mesmerizing tracks are timed and ready to be loaded in your editor, all available from [**LV.4**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/214)!

If you're familiar with **LV.4** already, chances are you're an osu!mania player who's played one of the billion maps for [*Angel Dust*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?c=featured_artists&q=%22angel%20dust%22&s=any). If you think we're kidding, take a look at the video below featuring **12** of these maps (which isn't even all of them!), then explore the other previews:

Wondering what to do next? Picking a song from [**LV.4**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/214) and starting on your next stream-filled map is a good choice. Any other responsibilities you have are secondary. Your teacher or boss or mom will understand, so you don't need to worry.

We're just about done here, but in case you're looking to slam your keyboard along to more music, we'll be back again next Wednesday to provide songs designed especially for keyboard slamming. Stay tuned to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) and we'll see you soon.
