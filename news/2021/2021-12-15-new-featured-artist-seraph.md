Gothic rock superstar **Seraph** steps aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/225/header.jpg)

**Seraph** isn't your ordinary J-rock band — they're a monster of a musical unit with involvement from heaps of different creators in the dark, symphonic rock scene. Meeting and exceeding all expectations for high-paced and intense beatmaps, **Seraph** is the perfect companion to Featured Artists like [Ariabl'eyeS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/93), [Pratanallis](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/175), and [Emille's Moonlight Serenade](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/160).

Spanning across their discography of 10 years and counting, a heavy batch of **40** grand tracks are pre-timed and ready for mapping from [**Seraph**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/225)!

[Atalanta](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7543834)'s beatmap of [Seraph - Resurrection](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/831738) provides a perfect sample of what **Seraph** brings to the table. Watch as 16 players *sightread* the map with Sudden Death enabled, or if you're more of a "hands on" kind of person, dive into the beatmap for yourself!

[**Seraph**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/225) is right around the corner. Preview some songs, toss one into the editor, then spam circles everywhere on the playfield. That'll be an innovative mapping technique in 2028. Mark our words.

There's one more release coming up this week! We're shifting back towards a creator who's popular in the rhythm game world, so look forward to complex melodies paired with inevitable bass-pounding. Watch for details on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) and we'll see you on Saturday!
