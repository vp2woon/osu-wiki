We're proud to welcome guitarist extraordinaire **Masahiro "Godspeed" Aoki** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/136/header.jpg)

A man with contributions in every corner of the video game scene, ex-*CAPCOM* composer [**Masahiro "Godspeed" Aoki**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/136) is an immensely talented producer, arranger, guitarist, and engineer with an unparalleled catalogue of work.

You might've heard his sound already from franchise entries like *Street Fighter V*, *FINAL FANTASY XV MULTIPLAYER: COMRADES*, and *ASTRAL CHAIN*, but if those games aren't really on your radar as a rhythm game player, you may recognize his library from *CHUNITHM*, *Taiko no Tatsujin*, or *Cytus II* instead.

Being a guitarist at heart, we've snagged **9** guitar-heavy masterpieces from the deity himself!

You'd be doing yourself a disservice by not listening to a few of these blood-pumping tracks. If video's more your style though, we asked [Vinno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10717635) to show us his tablet tapping prowess to the tune of Masahiro's [Blaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1323877) mapped by [Niva](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/197805). Check it all out:

As usual, these and a bundle more are available right now from [**Masahiro "Godspeed" Aoki**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/136), all pre-timed and ready to battle. Or ready to map. The choice is yours.

It's hard to imagine how much longer we can keep up this whole "announce two insanely talented new artists each week" thing, but we're not giving up! We've got another artist coming up this Saturday, so keep tabs on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for everything that matters.

Anyway, see you then!
