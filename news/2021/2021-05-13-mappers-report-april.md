## Ranking Criteria Changes

As always, we start with this month's ranking criteria changes. Let's hop right in and see what happened this month.

### All Modes

- **[Remove Song Restrictions from Qualified](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1282982)**: The days of speed ranking wars are over - multiple versions of the same song can now be qualified at the same time. This rule was a holdover from a bygone time that has lost its relevance in the modern age, and we're glad to see it gone.

## Open Ranking Criteria Proposals

### All Modes

- **[Video Games genre for songs that are only video game songs](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1314759)**
- **[Standardize dividing markers for maps containing 2 or more songs in the title](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1308666)**

## Within the Beatmap Nominators and NAT

As is the cycle of life, some Beatmap Nominators come and go every month. Here’s a list of all movements in the group recently:

## Mappers' Showcase

Since we have so many amazing storyboarders, we've decided to sneak in another storyboarder showcase this time around! Big thanks to [Walavouchey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079) for this month's picks.

### Peter

With an ever-growing prowess for the technical side of storyboarding, [Peter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8623835) continues to create impressive chaotic marvels to look at. Be warned, however, because you may need a decent computer in order to play these maps properly!

The concept choice for their interpretation of [Rachel (CV: Chisuga Haruka) - Pray](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/940111) is more than fitting for the dark mood of the song. The dense flood of sprites forms a dynamic texture as the background. Along with just the right colour scheme, image choice, and some 3D effects to boot, this storyboard scores full marks on musical representation!

One of their more *expressive* works is for [Utsu-P - I thought I was an angel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1004320), containing an abundance of complex sprite formations and something that can be only described as pure chaos. While perhaps not comparable to the prettiest of paintings, this storyboard doesn't fail to match the song's intensity in the slightest. Props to anyone who can clear this one with 0% background dim!

For even more craziness, check out the visuals for [BilliumMoto - life flashes before weeb eyes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/985172) and its barrage of pretty colours covering the screen! Nearly every sound in the music is expressed in some way, from the quick synths and piano to the great variety of sound samples. The creative usage of simple shapes, namely circles, hearts, rectangles and triangles, is definitely a good resource for ideas!

### - AzRaeL -

Being undoubtedly an outstanding storyboarder for a couple years now, [- AzRaeL -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10027577) has amassed quite the collection of beautiful storyboards! Their meticulously squeaky clean visuals have only been improving time after time, showing excellence despite simplicity.

A prime showcase of - AzRaeL -'s expertise is on [Tanchiky - WABI-CIRCUIT (Original Mix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1081177), featuring gorgeous artwork with parallax, clean transition effects, and exceptional design. For the intense map, the amazing but minimal background may lend itself well to players who play better without flashy distractions. Do give it a try!

As a fairly recently ranked example (at least in the storyboarding world), their visuals for [SEKAI NO OWARI - Hey Ho](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1157286#osu/2415040) seem almost too appropriate. This one too has a simpler design, with fitting background art, clear sections that reflect the song, and impactful moments to accentuate the adventurous vibe.

The storyboard for [Liu Zeng Tong - Lun Hui](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/854025#osu/1784763) is an excellent example of an *even* simpler storyboard showcasing a high level of skill. When many fancy visual effects don't fit, details can still tremendously increase quality. Colour scheme, composition, text font, image selection, and many more details, when meticulously ironed out, blend together to form a cohesive experience. This is an easier beatmap, so definitely recommend this one to newer players!

And that's it! There's even more to check out, however, because these two have even more storyboards out there. We look forward to whatever else they may have up their sleeves for the future!

Along with amazing storyboards that have come out in general, a sizeable batch of great new storyboards were produced in the recently ended A Labour of Love contest! You can read a bit more about it in the section below, but do have a look at its [results news post](http://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2021-04-27-results-a-labour-of-love), or its [wiki page](/wiki/Contests/A_Labour_of_Love_Contest) for a list of each participating storyboard!

If you're up for the task to compete with these marvellous creations, you may want to pop in the [osu! storyboarder banquet Discord server](https://discord.gg/B8NX7YW) for the greatest in the making as well as the latest in the discussion of the art of sprite-twiddling!

## Mapping Contests

Hold it right there competition-thirsty fellows! We're right here with you again, this time with a hefty batch of news related to mapping contests all over the community.

### A Labour of Love Concludes

Oriented around one of the most iconic songs within the osu! community (namely *Kuba Oms - My Love*), the A Labour of Love contest has recently come to a close.

Consisting of musician and mapper panels on top of community vote, the contest was the first official full-spectrum (aka, mapping, music and storyboarding in one package) mapping contest held to date, and did a lot to bring light to the artistic talent within the osu! community. Here's a brief coverage of the overall results:

| Award | Team | Submission |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| ![A Labour of Love: Community Pick](https://assets.ppy.sh/profile-badges/alol_communitypick.png "A Labour of Love: Community Pick") | Team Red but Blue | [Kuba Oms - My Love (Redside Remix) (feat. Hatsune Miku)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1388993) |
| ![A Labour of Love: Overall Runner-up](https://assets.ppy.sh/profile-badges/alol_overallrunnerup.png "A Labour of Love: Overall Runner-up") | schoolboy fans | [Kuba Oms - My Love (Shadren Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1382412) |
| ![A Labour of Love: Overall Winner](https://assets.ppy.sh/profile-badges/alol_overallwinner.png "A Labour of Love: Overall Winner") | extremely valid | [Raphlesia & BilliumMoto - My Love](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1388906) |

Details regarding the results, along with the livestream VOD (which includes commentary by pishifat, Uberzolik and Ephemeral) can be viewed in [this newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2021-04-27-results-a-labour-of-love). For further information about the contest, we recommend you pay a visit to the [wiki article](/wiki/Contests/A_Labour_of_Love_Contest)!

### Monthly Beatmapping Contest: March & April

Just like our monthly mapping-flavoured bulletin, the streak continues for the Monthly Beatmapping Contest as well.

If you recall, the March edition of the contest was held in both osu! and osu!taiko game modes. On the osu! side of things, we have an underdog among the veterans, [Innovation](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6304412) winning the contest.

On the other hand, appearing as the runner-up, [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515) not only achieves the third tier profile badge, but also attains the *Elite Mapper* user title. But it doesn't end there, because this title laters turns into *Elite Mapper II* thanks to his participation in the winning entry for [A Labour of Love](/wiki/Contests/A_Labour_of_Love_Contest). As for the Screener Crew #1, [Acylica](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1943309) takes the spotlight and gets an inch closer to the *Elite Mapper* title. Huge applause to them for their flawless victories!

The osu!taiko section of the contest had [Ph0eNiiXZ](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9463721) rise to the first place, followed by [Nifty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4956097) as the runner-up. Many congrats to both of them!

If you're craving for some details, [this newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2021-04-23-results-monthly-beatmapping-contest-march-2021) should satisfy your needs.

Next up, the April edition of Monthly Beatmapping Contest greets us with a few novelties. For the first time ever, the contest will entertain osu!catch submissions in addition to osu! and osu!taiko. The submission period has since ended, but for those interested, the limitations for April were as follows:

- **osu!**:
  - All sliders must use red anchors.
  - Red anchors must form clear corners in the slidershape.
- **osu!taiko**:
  - No more than 3 of the same note colours in a row.
- **osu!catch**:
  - Sliders cannot be used.

If you're excited to see the results, we suggest you take few minutes to look through [this newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2021-04-08-monthly-beatmapping-contest-april-2021) to keep yourself up-to-date with the details.

For those unfamiliar with the format of the Monthly Beatmapping Contest and its proceedings, go ahead and read through the [wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest).

### osu! Beatmapping World Championship 2021: Registrations Open

It's that time of the year again! For the *third* mapping contest of this issue, we're featuring the *third* iteration of the osu! Beatmapping Championship, registrations for which have already opened.

Keeping the notion of country-based competition, the 2021 edition of the contest is allowing multiple teams to be formed to represent a particular country, yet only one among them will get the chance of proceeding further than the first round. May the best team win!

What's more, a judging panel featuring a notable batch of professional circle-clickers has been added to the contest proceedings, which will function like a side dish to the main contest. While a hit squad of high-level mappers are evaluating the submissions, the professional player panel will be test-playing these to rate them in accordance with a certain set of criteria. Sounds interesting, doesn't it?

Oh, and if you're a drum basher, fruit catcher or keyboard masher, this one is just for you! This year, the osu!taiko, osu!catch and osu!mania editions of Beatmapping World Championship are going to be organized as well! The details for these contests are work-in-progress, but you still have a chance to partake in the judging panels if you're interested in helping out — check out [this form](https://forms.gle/Yu2M2ZiwhapJYc7K7) for more details!

The particulars concerning the contest and so much more can be found in full within [this newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2021-05-02-osu-beatmapping-world-championship-2021-registrations-open), the [wiki article](/wiki/Contests/oBWC/3) and the [official website](https://obwc.net/). Check them all out!

### osu!mania J-Rock Mapping Contest

Attention to all J-Rock fans out there! If you're keen on playing the keytar, this will probably catch your interest.

Organized by [RiP46](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5222596), osu!mania J-Rock Mapping Contest is featuring three lovely songs, each of which everyone can participate in.

As for the most exciting part (the prizes), the winning mapset for each song will be pushed to ranked. Yes, you read it right, but that's not even it! The second and third place runner-ups will have the chance to participate in the winning set with a guest difficulty.

Well, what are you waiting for? Start tuning your keytar and head over to the [forum thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1312702) for details!

### osu!mania Otaku TV Size Mapping Contest #2

Looks like another osu!mania-related mapping contest is on the horizon. Here comes the Otaku TV Size Mapping Contest for you to enjoy the spirit of anime to the fullest!

Hosted by [Sun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4115819), [Murumoo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8001433), [Paran](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13340203) and [deta5859](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15275662), the contest allows everyone to participate in both of the two pre-selected songs.

The winning entry hosting the runner-ups' guest difficulties will be speed-carried to the ranked section, and you will have the pleasure of being remembered as an *Otaku Mapper*! For better or worse.

If you're an anime fan, don't let this opportunity pass you by! Have a thorough look at this [forum thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1308172) and you're good to go!
