Thrash legend **Vektor** joins the Featured Artist lineup!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/158/header.jpg)

Continuing the trend of pulling the best of the best metal bands into osu!, we're proud to introduce **Vektor** — an America-based thrash/progressive metal band with an unmistakablely impressive sound. Their metal masterpieces are a clear cut above the rest, iconized by endless high-BPM fills and vocal screeches that might make you think your neighbour is having a heart attack (in the most endearing way possible).

**22** epic tracks have been scoured from across **Vektor**'s 3 studio albums, all available for mapping now from their [Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/158).

Distinguished metal mapper [Mazzerin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2942381) started the **Vektor** trend with his map of [*Fast Paced Society*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/298996), so it's only fitting to introduce them to osu! officially with the same map. Check out the 5-way combo-holding competition in the video below, or preview these other songs:

One more artist is slated for this weekend. Keep tabs on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for news on that and some other special stuff coming near the end of the week. Until then!
