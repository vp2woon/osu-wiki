**PTB10** joins the ranks as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/227/header.jpg)

Hailing from England, **PTB10** has been constructing his own blend of electronic music inspired by the vast electronic scene (namely rhythm game music) and a touch of film/game scores. In gaming scenes, he first entered the spotlight via the community-focused game *Cytoid*, eventually progressing towards commercial games like *Cytus II*, *DEEMO*, *Dynamix*, *VOEZ*, and many more!

**8** mindblowing tracks are at your doorstep and ready for mapping from [**PTB10**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/227).

**PTB10** might be a new name to some osu! players, so you're lucky that [Altai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5745865) from the Mappers' Guild has prepared a showcase beatmap of [PTB10 - Starfall](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1648460).
