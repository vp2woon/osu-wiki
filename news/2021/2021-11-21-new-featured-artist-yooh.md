Legendary producer and DJ **Yooh** finally storms into our Featured Artist collection!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/218/header.jpg)

Yes, you heard right. **Yooh** is at your circle-clicking doorstep ready to blast his club, electronic, and hardcore hits straight through your flimsy drywall. Known throughout practically *all* of the rhythm game scene since his *SOUND VOLTEX* debut in 2012, **Yooh** is a household name we're proud to officially support in osu!.

If you could only hear a handful of songs for the rest of your life, we think you'd be happy with the **30** epic tracks that [**Yooh**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/218) has to offer.

Oh, did you hear the news?

**Yooh** also composed a song specifically for [OWC 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2021)'s Grand Finals tiebreaker! The map pool showcase on [the osulive Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) was where a bunch of osu! players learned that **Yooh** was a Featured Artist, so in case you missed it, the ultra-fancy debut video is below. Check that out (along with all the other sick previews, of course).
