We hope you've been saving up some good fruit puns, because the osu!catch World Cup 2021 is about to begin, and we're looking for mappers, commentators and referees to help make it happen!

In this upcoming edition of the osu!catch World Cup 2021, we're looking to implement some positive changes inspired by previous World Cups. To help with that, we're now taking on applications for a few critical staffing positions in the tournament  - read on to find out more!

### Mapper for custom CWC maps

Following the trend of including custom-made maps specifically for the tournament (as seen in the past OWC 2020 and also in community tournaments like the recent AxS sixth edition), we're also looking to hop aboard the bandwagon with some custom maps of our own in the pools for CWC 2021.

Are you a skilled osu!catch mapper and are interested in helping create some tailored challenges for some of the world's best and brightest players? This is your chance to get involved and leave your mark on the mapping world - forever!

If you're available from today all the way across the rest of May, check out the application form below and send us your details, we'd be delighted to work with you.

[Apply here](https://forms.gle/fP98XSM5h3hYb1Ex5) if you are interested in helping out!

### Commentator/Referee

Commentators and referees help to keep the tournament running in tip-top shape. Though they may be very different skillsets, both of them are extremely important and we're currently in need of experienced (and/or enthusiastic) commentators and dedicated referees to help out.

If you're experienced (or a really quick learner) in either field and available on weekends from late April to early June with a passion for all things fruity, you might just be exactly who we need - check out the form below and let us know, we'd love to hear from you.

[Apply here](https://forms.gle/XcpXMrYtGDZHVcmQ7) if you are interested in helping out either as a referee or a commentator!
