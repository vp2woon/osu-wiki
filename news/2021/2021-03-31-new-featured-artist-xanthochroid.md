**Xanthochroid** brings sounds from another world to the Featured Artist library!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/152/header.jpg)

Crafting their own cinematic metal universe with back to back masterpieces, **Xanthochroid** is a first-rate progressive rock/metal band who's been aggressively charming eardrums since 2005. Following their 2012 debut album's release, the band toured the US with a climactic performance at *Blizzcon* in 2013, and has continued to expand their music's narrative through new songs to this day.

**16** of these mood-rich tracks are now available for your mapping experimentation, all from [**Xanthochroid**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/152`).

Something you might immediately notice is that these tracks are (mostly) catered towards the highest echelon of difficulty. To even things out, [eiri-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3388410) and [Zelq](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8953955) of the Mappers' Guild have been hard at work setting up a full difficulty spread for [*Xanthochroid - The Sound of Hunger Rises*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1335143), allowing players of all skill levels to engage with this glorious 6 minute track.

Check that out, along with a video showcasing the range of intensity in **Xanthochroid**'s works, plus a whole bunch of other cool maps:
