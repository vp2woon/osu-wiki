Channeling only the harshest of harsh sounds, **ovEnola** joins the lineup as our latest Featured Artist!

Rumor has it that members of the 4 piece band **ovEnola** have been crafting their own brand of metal since before they could walk. That's what you'd expect at least, given the way they shred makes it seem like they have decades of experience. The band instead claims to have started thrashing in 2016 and released their first full-length album *Left Behind* in August of last year.

With **9** tracks available from that gem of an album, we're proud to provide more material to our insanely impressive metal mapping scene.

[Noose](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1348020) mapped by [BOUYAAA](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/405449) (one of osu!'s most prolific rock and metal mappers) provides a pretty solid example of how this music deserves to be mapped. Check it out in the video below, or preview any of these other tracks:
