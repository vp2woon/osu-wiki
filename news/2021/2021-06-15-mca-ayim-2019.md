## A Year In Mapping 2019

AYIM is back at long last for another round of highlighting the achievements and statistics of the mapping community in 2019.

### Statistics

As in previous editions, each mode will have a section of statistics such as who ranked the most sets, how many difficulties were ranked overall, the extremes in difficulty levels we saw ranked, and many, many more records than you can think of. You like interesting fun facts, trivia, fancy numbers? AYIM has all of those covered for the beatmaps and mappers ranked in 2019.

### Commenting on 2019 mappers

Before, organizers were responsible for writing comments on each mapper who ranked beatmaps that year. These comments would sum up their achievements and place in the 2019 community. Everyone contributes their part, and AYIM seeks to help put that out there for others to see, learn, and appreciate. For an idea of what that has looked like in the past, check out the [AYIM 2018 Forum thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/966004).

**Here's what's new:** this time, we're opening up writing these comments to *everyone*. Know some banger beatmaps from 2019 or a mapper who left a huge impression on you at that time? Somebody helped mod your beatmap in 2019 and you remember it to this day? Any contribution they made on a personal or larger level in 2019 is fair game to write a comment about. Let them know your thoughts by posting your comments to the website.

Again, this is open for everyone to participate in, so let your positivity be heard!

Writing comments will be open **until** the results of MCA are posted.

All of these statistics and features can be found on the [AYIM website](https://ayim.corsace.io/2019), so head on over now and get involved.

## Mapper's Choice Awards 2019

The Mapper's Choice Awards are to mappers of that year what Community Choice is to the general community, with extra bells and whistles in the forms of different categories and multiple winners for each.

It is one of the biggest mapping events in the year, and has run anually since 2016. After a hiatus, MCA is now making its grand return to round up 2019. If you'd like to see previous years, check out their forum threads: [2016](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/544747), [2017](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/734377), and [2018](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/966003).

If you ranked a beatmap, guest difficulty or storyboard during 2019, you're cordially invited to make your thoughts known to help the community decide the best of the best in a large variety of categories across all four game modes.

To those new, the Mappers' Choice Awards has three stages: nomination, voting, and results.

- **Nomination:** Eligible users can submit any beatmaps/storyboards or users from 2019 they feel are deserving of recognition in their respective categories.
- **Voting:** Eligible users can vote on the pool of submitted nominations.
- **Results:** Will be based off the results of voting and feature a livestream discussing each of the top winners.

Those who win regular awards on their beatmaps or storyboards in the results will be given 2 months of supporter, and grand prize winners will receive 6 months of supporter. The rest of us will gain valuable perspective on what the mapping community really thinks, so don't miss out if you're eligible to get involved!

Nomination and voting will be happening through the [Mapper's Choice Awards website](https://mca.corsace.io). Don't skip it!

Thank you to everyone who has made these possible, especially our main organizer [VINXIS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4323406).

We look forward to seeing everyone's votes and comments for 2019.
