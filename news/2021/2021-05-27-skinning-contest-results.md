Around 2 months ago, a ship of skins with an entirely vacant cargo bay arrived at the dock, waiting to be loaded with the best of the best. After getting their palettes ready, **31** ship painters heard our call to arms and stood up for the competition with their pieces of artistic beauty.

Although having to choose only **3** of all those masterpieces might have led some of you to suffer from sea-sickness, in the end, a total of **15703** ballots were collected from **5914** unique voters as the ship sailed.

Our crewmates have finally finished counting all the votes and now is the time to announce the results. Here come the masterful creations, and their skinners extraordinaire reserving a spot on the podium. Let's have a look!

## 3rd Place - notMiku

[**Nikstrim**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10577559) managed to impress **1435** voters with this terrific piece of art named [notMiku](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1292954), achieving themselves a shiny bronze medal!

Accommodating a rather minimalistic and flat design, notMiku takes the idea of a futuristic design and implements it for osu! perfectly. Opting for plain colours and simple effects, the skin creates the perfect environment where players can not only focus on the gameplay but also take all its techno-charm in at the same time. This skin will make you feel like seeing the world through a visor with its sharp-edged interface elements and clean icons.

The mod icons look minimal, but are still information-rich and cleverly concatenate on the results screen, showing how much Nikstrim values attention to detail. The absence of the usual effects included in techno-themed skins, like massive glows and flashy effects, goes with the minimalistic approach superbly. Feeling the breeze of the future with notMiku will give you the feeling of a ride in a spaceship. The future is now!

The harmony of futuristic design and simplistic structures illustrated in notMiku rewards Nikstrim with the 3rd place profile badge! Great work, Nikstrim!

## 2nd Place - Minimalist 2.0

**1849** voters couldn't help but cast their vote for this masterpiece called [Minimalist 2.0](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1286223), crafted by the very hands of [**Krizto**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13474556), reserving them 2nd place on the podium!

As the name suggests, Minimalist 2.0 takes a better approach to the notion of minimalism in skinning by making good use of colouring and diagonal layouts. From the relaxation provided by the bubbles flying out of the menu to the refreshment taken in from the diagonal layouts and the novel approach to the mode select interface, the skin manages to keep the fancy elements properly rubbed in under its minimalistic structure.

Offering some needed contrast to the dark-grey ambiance, light mountain and accent colours differentiate the skin from its minimalist counterparts. Additionally, the skin utilizes a rare gimmick - a fully-animated bottom section - that most other skins handle poorly. Yet, Krizto's skillful hands have taken the hearts of many skinning enthusiasts with this very trick. If you're tired of playing with static skins, Minimalist 2.0 will most certainly satisfy your animation-thirsty needs!

Krizto's beloved masterpiece, Minimalist 2.0, earns them a shiny 2nd place profile badge inspired by the very artist's minimalistic touches! Good job, Krizto!

## Winner - FREEDOM DiVE↓

Forged with love by the well-known osu! player [**BTMC**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691) and his team, [FREEDOM DiVE↓](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1293207) takes the lead with **3705** votes, outscoring the 2nd place by just over twice as much!

Rather than simplicity and minimalism as harboured by most other submissions, FREEDOM DiVE↓ features a vivid theme with colourful visual effects, carried out masterfully with aesthetic hand-drawn elements. Inspired by the song belonging to one of the most iconic beatmaps of all time, [xi - FREEDOM DiVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/39804), the skin revolves around the little animate orb greeting the user on every screen with its cute expressions.

Despite the extravagantly placed objects and richness in colour, team BTMC did a great job ensuring that none of the objects distract the player from clicking the circles. Appeasing the flamboyance-adorers with its well-designed artworks and animations, this skin guarantees you a pleasant and distraction-free gameplay session as well. Without a doubt, FREEDOM DiVE↓ is the perfect "osu! Champion approved" skin for those who like tagging along with the same skin as their favourite osu! player.

With his FREEDOM DiVE↓ entry, BTMC is awarded the trophy worthy of a champion, a profile badge featuring the mascot of the all-time popular FREEDOM DiVE song! Congratulations BTMC, well-deserved!
