We're proud to welcome modern VOCALOID talent **Kitazawa Kyouhei** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/165/header.jpg)

Forging moody atmospheres with each of their tracks, **Kitazawa Kyouhei** is the mastermind producer and composer behind a new tonal brand of VOCALOID. His works dive into dark themes with their lyrics while pushing a progressive style of instrumentation, pulling ideas from modern pop to catchy trap rhythms and anything in between.

Covering all the bases of beatmaps, we've got **8** new tracks up for grabs from [**Kitazawa Kyouhei**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/165), each packed with its own song-specific background and music video! And if that wasn't enough, the song *TRUE-QUEEN* has been released exclusively for osu!.

While **Kitazawa Kyouhei** discovered his passion for VOCALOID through playing osu! in 2012, it's not until today that his music is finally returning to those roots. [-Sylvari](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3493804) of the Mappers' Guild is here to plant the first seed with their beatmap of [*ONIRIC*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1373644/), as seen below with a bunch of skins from our recent [skinning contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/126).

Check that out and listen to the rest of these awesome song previews:
