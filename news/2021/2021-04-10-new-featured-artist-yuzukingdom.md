We're proud to welcome **YUZUKINGDOM** as our latest Featured Artist!

What happens when you merge an insanely talented J-rock vocalist with the instrumental prowess of legendary metal band [BLOOD STAIN CHILD](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/126)? The only possible outcome is **YUZUKINGDOM** — a side project for vocalist Yuzuki (a.k.a. *KING*) from the rock band Q'ulle.

**YUZUKINGDOM** has released a trio of high intensity albums since their launch in 2018, each featuring the hardcore force to be expected from metal, and contrasted with Yuzuki's poppy vocals.

We've hand-picked **11** of the most osu!-esque songs from these albums, all available right now from [**YUZUKINGDOM**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/155).

Not familiar with these musical gems? Give yourself a taste by watching as [NiN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7166622) struggles to play a map of [*YUZUKINGDOM - Roskill Lavender*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1410727) by [Nao Tomori](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5364763) in a super tiny 640x480 window. Oh, and check out the rest of these previews:
