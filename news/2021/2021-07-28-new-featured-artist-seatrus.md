A familiar name to those who witnessed [*MONONOKE*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1280194) in [OWC 2020](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2020), **seatrus** is a Tokyo-based producer with a knack for rhythm game-inspired songs designed specifically for rhythm game communities. From *SOUND VOLTEX* to *Lanota* to *Dynamix* and many many more, **seatrus**'s self-described "otaku music" has connected with countless gaming niches, with osu! officially being one of them as of today!

**21** awesome tracks across the spectrum of hardcore electronic genres are now available for mapping from [**seatrus**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/185)!

You know the only thing fancier than the new difficulty icon colours? It's [**seatrus**'s Featured Artist page](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/185). Give mapping a try and you'll never want to go back. Come on, all the cool people are doing it.

That's all for now! Join us on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) for details on Saturday's new artist and a memorial for osu! veterans overwhelmed by mentions of *wysi* and *klee* throughout the last 24 hours.

Stay tuned!
