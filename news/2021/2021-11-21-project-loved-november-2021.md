The countdown until Christmas has started, but the Project Loved Team has already got presents ready for you!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)

To those who need a reminder, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the Loved Captains of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the Project Loved forum [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! You can read more about this project on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved)!

As usual, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the October votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

Motivating yourself to practice can be grueling, and it's up to the song choice to decide that motivation. Thankfully, maps like this one exist. Short and sweet, the map is two minutes of 220 BPM bursts and stamina. Clean mapping, clean song, clean background ‚Å†‚Äî what else could you want in a map?

osu! needs more Nanahira, and this map is here to help. Sitting at 9.4 stars, this map is raw aim at its core, streams intertwined within. Known especially for a special moment in osu! history, when WhiteCat, former #1 player, was unbanned while playing this map. Hopefully you will feel as elated as he was when voting for this map this month. Enjoy\~!

Koe is a wonderfully upbeat song, mapped perfectly to reflect its vibes. As a 6.6\* 151 BPM alt map, Koe is a smooth, flowy map, with constantly changing angles and patterns, culminating in a grand ending, with fast sliders and quick repeating 1-2's. Exploding like a firework, watching in awe, I wish you enjoy.

*description written by [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983)*

Anyone who frequented multiplayer games in 2013 to 2015 will probably recognize this one, because it was a go-to map for lobby hosts everywhere. This is a classic 2013 aim map created by two of the quintessential mappers of the style. It is hosted by caren_sk, whose maps became very popular between high-level players, and features a guest difficulty by a very prolific mapper called HabiHolic.

Set at 208 BPM, and coming in AR 9 and AR 10 flavors, the aim patterns in this map feel consistently fast, helped by a high base SV on both difficulties. HabiHolic's difficulty leans quite heavily on the vocals, while caren_sk's map brings in more of the percussion, and a healthy dose of symmetry! Be ready for plenty of linear aim patterns too.

This set has an old-school feel, but the smoothness of these difficulties hold up remarkably well. Give them a go and see if you agree with me!

*description written by [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983)*

This isn't the first time Mr HeliX has made an appearance in the Loved vote. He has made a habit of making creative maps utilizing fully storyboarded elements to create unique reading challenges not possible with normal circles. This is another example of that style, fresh from the same lab that brought you [Time Traveler](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1236988#osu/2573493), now with a map for the [Banger Bonanza](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1282642) tournament. For me, this is my favorite osu! map that utilizes storyboarded gameplay elements, and here's why.

This map for *MAKE IT FUNKY NOW* avoids many of the issues that storyboarded gameplay elements can suffer from. This is all my opinion, but after the novelty of the crazy elements wears off, most maps feel a bit rough, a bit off, and not so satisfying to grind for a score on because they lack the proper feedback of the gameplay elements that they emulate. I usually cannot get into them.

This map gets around it by doing something completely different, without making the gameplay overly gimmicky. It might still lack feedback from dropped notes, but the way it constantly shifts between different visual elements that are vastly different to osu! circles, while still being so well suited to this game is impressive. It is both intuitive and really fun to try to get better at all of the different patterns, not to mention that the visuals are fantastic. No dimmed backgrounds here, it's just as good to watch as it is to play!

I have not had more fun playing a map of this style than I have with this map. This one really does make it funky.

We have seen several challenging maps ranging from speed maps to complex snaps and patterns in Loved recently, so having a map like *Yonezu Kenshi - Flamingo (ToYou Bootleg)* by Cure once in a while will sure be a refreshing addition to the Loved section.

Featured in several tournaments for their early stages, there is no doubt this map proposes a solid accuracy and consistency test for low- to mid-ranked players, with an engaging style of mapping all on top of an entertaining song.

It's nice to give a little rest to your keyboard from those intense key smashing sessions from time to time, so if you just want to have a fun and peaceful time this map is for you!

It has been a while since the last full taiko set in Loved, so we are glad to present *8284 - Connaextion* by Nwolf for this month's voting!

This mapset features a great difficulty progression between diffs that will guide you through the journey of low/double-BPM mapping. With a top diff that plays either like a 290 or 145 BPM map depending on how you play it, and an Oni that effectively translates said concept for the ascending drum smashers out there, this mapset is a must-play for anyone looking for setting some skill benchmarks for themselves, on any skill level. That's the beauty of full sets after all!

This map is a collaboration between KinomiCandy and MMzz. Both of them are famous mappers, and I'm sure you've heard of them.

Since KinomiCandy and MMzz are mappers with completely different mapping styles, their collaboration has resulted in a noticeable difference in each part of the map, so if you play it, you can actually feel the difference. If you're curious about it, please play it and see for yourself!

*...during pride month?*, more commonly known as *stop being gay* is a part of Genjuro's SV-intensive series of maps simply known as '-'. *...during pride month?* is no exception: featuring wavy SV from start to finish, the map requires your full attention due to high-contrast note overlaps, SV going as high as 1.5x, and most notably the 0.25x SV stream that takes place a quarter into the map. This map is a fan favourite and it's easy to see why!

This will be the perfect one to represent nananass's own unique mapping style, considering the drastic 1/6 and 1/8 usage in the top diff making a great synergy with the song. The map was just way too popular ‚Å†‚Äî when the beatmap with same song got ranked, some people were mentioning this beatmap as well. If you're big fan of challenging those intense patterns, this will be another nice one to challenge too!

Are you ready for the killer machine?

It is time to shine some light upon this map again, *NOMA - Brain Power* by \[Force\]. As the title suggests, it is a "no dash" map, meaning you only have to use your movement controls (left and right) while completely ignoring your dash button.

This map is probably one of the best maps to get into no dash maps, as the map does not feature anything other than these patterns. For starters, just a normal NoMod attempt would suffice while the higher-end players can slap on some HardRock, some DoubleTime, or perhaps even both?

Oh and how could I forget, the obligatory O-oooooooooo AAAAE-A-A-I-A-U- JO-oooooooooooo AAE-O-A-A-U-U-A- E-eee-ee-eee AAAAE-A-E-I-E-A-JO-ooo-oo-oo-oo EEEEO-A-AAA-AAAA!

Ever since hyperdashes were introduced all the way back in 2009, they became an integral part of osu!catch and people became really creative with various different ways of how to utilize them. But have you ever wondered how a map looks like that deliberately avoids them? We rarely ever get such maps as they are very off-meta, so maybe you haven't played one.

I shall present you this map by Yumeno Himiko, completely hyperdash-free. If you think it is easy because of that, then you are either clueless or built differently. The difficulty of this map comes from very tight jumps and difficult stream patterns which require precise timing to catch.

The map is also not the shortest, so you have to bring some consistency to the table too in order to FC it. Pretty sure playing Hidden is not good for health on this map as this was picked as a Hidden map for the 2020 World Cup Grand Final. Give this map a shot though, it is really good!

Welp, what can I say? Since the other captains have decided to only throw in single-diff maps for the 2nd month in a row, here's me trying to spice it up again with an actual set, and with a newcomer to the Loved section at that! Am I not amazing, dear reader?! Everybody knows Du5t, and everybody knows Everything will Freeze by now, so what happens if you combine the two? That's right, ice-cold awesomeness.

This set offers 7 distinct difficulties which means that (here comes my famous line once again) there is something to play for everyone! This map is quite intense as expected, and heavily laden with streams all over the place to really get those finger-muscles going. The playcount on this set is quite remarkably high, as there isn't really any other full set for this beloved song in osu!catch, hence why I wanted to put it in the limelight today.

So don't freeze up yet! Go check this nice set out, and click that nice lil' *vote yes* button if you did enjoy it!

You know, it's kind of rare to see a jazz song in osu!catch, yet Emiru managed to make a fantastic map of a cool jazz song. Jazz songs are pretty hard to map in catch due to their complex and fancy rhythms, and a lot of musical shifts, yet with the affluent experience Emiru has in catch mapping, he managed to express all of them very well.

He also provides a cut version of the second half of the map as its own difficulty, where the music becomes more extreme and harder, so if you want something quick and challenging it would also be nice to try that one first.

Time for some swingy jazz, shall we dance in the caravan?

Orca- has been a fresh but prolific contributor to the SV scene, not only in terms of mapping, but also establishing its competitive appeal through the [SV Summer Exhibition](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1313374) tournament (more to come!). *Mafain* would constitue their very first Loved entry, and what a way to bust into the roster that would be!

What some might consider one of the most unforgettable DJ SHARPNEL tracks has finally been brought up to the Loved scene from the experienced hands of Shoegazer, one of the most well-known pillars of the mapping community thus far! They've really been putting quite an unsurmountable amount of effort in charting Jea's tracks all throughout this year. You can find their compendium in their [*Sharpnel Instrumentality Project*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1457890#mania/2996179), where all of their tracks have been compiled.

Coming back to the topic however, most people will recognize this map from its usage in the [**osu!mania World Cup 2021**](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2021_4K) on the Finals mappool. Thankfully you will not be forced to play this intense ordeal at 1.35x as all the other beasts who arrived at that round had to! Everyone is free to play this magnificent Jumpstream experience at their own pace, so feel free to give it a shot yourself.

Also, it is morally correct to change the track your girlfriend is listening to *FAKE PROMISE* at any given time. This has happened before... right?

Wait, is this a *third* SV entry? Huh, we're really going all out it seems!

*KillerBeast* is a different brand of SV, being more of a multiplayer lobby classic rather than a tournament entry. It is also IceDynamix's first Loved entry, but players may already be aware of them through their [ranked set of HyuN's *Grin*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/923488).

IceDynamix has blessed the SV community with [iceSV](https://github.com/IceDynamix/iceSV), a nifty plugin to [Quaver's](https://quavergame.com/) map editor automating some effects and making the SV mapping experience more enjoyable. Did I just advertise Quaver on an osu! news post?

Anyway, the map itself is more of a reading-oriented experience than the two previous entries, which makes our three SV entries of this wave quite varied overall!

Give some homework to the SV players and get your votes in! This may be one of the biggest flows of SV maps we will see in Loved history.

That's right, another banger from the ever-so-popular Korean mapper 11Bit! *Flamenco House* is an interesting mixture of tech dump charting that comes neatly packed up with nearly every pattern and snap you can think of!

The song itself is not too hasty, at just 130 BPM. Despite that, the speedy patterns and bursts used make the chart surprisingly speedy. 11Bit really went all out with interpretation of funky synths and rhythms, including 1/5, 1/6, 1/8, 1/10 and 1/12 (and possibly even more) snaps into the chart representing different sounds.

Most of the patterning is focused on stairs, one-handed trills and fluent transitioning between them. The bursts are neatly joined with jacks and slow quadstreams. The second major section is a bit harder than the first, so take care! The added rates really spice up the chart even further, making it quite a challenge, especially in terms of timing.

If you're a fan of fluent and fun dump charting, do not hesitate to vote for *Flamenco House* in the voting!

[Monheim](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6814203) is back to the Loved votings, with their map of *Toxic*!

To anyone familiar with *Monheim's* charting style for "unconventional" songs such as this one, the map takes a very clear and consistent dump-approach to the patterning. Many ideas stay from the beginning of the chart all the way to the finish, examples being the heavy flams charted to the guitar samples, speedy single-stream-like patterns for the vocals, and even some LNs to break up the pace.

Over time this chart has proven to be a fan favorite to those who follow Mon's work, and it's easy to see why. Give Mon your support for the work she's done here by giving your vote!

But what makes the map so special? It is a complete speed test, meant for everyone thanks to the vast selection of rates! Maybe you only like the Yolk.

LaoXiao- makes their first appearance to the Loved votings with their chordjack gauntlet of *Sendan Life*! LaoXiao- is a hardworking mapper, who many people who peruse the unranked section should be familiar with. In the span of just over a couple years, they've managed to upload nearly 100 charts containing a huge variety of song choice and difficulty ranges.

What we have here for the votings though, is a map they made which quickly garnered large amounts of popularity and it's pretty clear to see why. This remix of *Sendan Life* done by katagiri is a song they released at the end of 2019, which immediately introduced osu! a slew of new maps.

The approach that Lao took with the song is very easy to understand and is highly accessible for players who are comfortable with patterns at this speed. As I mentioned, this is a straightforward chordjack gauntlet, and one that contains some very ergonomic and gratifying patterns to play.

More specifically, the 1/2-snapped notes in 260 BPM come out at 130 BPM, which is a very comfortable range for experienced jack players. Lao does however manage to slide in some difficult transitions to keep players from getting too comfortable, such as extended anchors and even some quads.

For those looking to up the speed on things, there are of course a number of uprates included in the set which go up to 300 BPM (150 BPM jacks). We're happy to bring you all this community favorite, and also the long overdue first nomination for LaoXiao-!

Xnery's *Swamp Thing* makes its way to Loved! This is a set that the mania captains have been sitting on for a while, and we're glad that it can finally be put up. This 8-difficulty set contains a good variety of difficulty for players, as well as GDs from both inv41idu53rn4m3 and Dubstek.

I think the easiest way to talk about the assortment of content that's in this set is to just break some of the difficulties down. The EZ, NM and HD diffs contain some pretty entry level patterns, while of course seeing some density increase when you move up, all as expected.

But it's when you get to inv41lid's diff that things start getting interesting. This difficulty is essentially a note-for-note copy of HD, but the entire map is filled with stuttering SVs that are incredibly difficult to translate while playing. So for people wanting to properly play it, it's just going to take some practice, along with maybe studying the HD diff a bit.

Moving up to MX, we just see a density increase from HD with the introduction of more hands and chords. Moving up again to the SC and Experimental SC, we have another case like HD. Pretty much another note for note copy, however SC contains ample amounts of jumpy SV to accompany the patterns. Then of course lastly, we have Dubstek's top difficulty. A heavy-handed jack chart that incorporates some LN and lots of SV.

All of the difficulties here provide a different experience from each other, which, along with the popularity this set has gained over the years from the community, makes this set more than deserving to have a spot in Loved. Make sure to vote!

lemon's instant tournament hit of ETIA.'s *Daisycutter* is here! This map was immediately picked up and used in multiple tournaments right when he uploaded it, and for good reason. Sometimes as a mapper, you get completely in tune with the song you're working with, and it's like everything clicks together. This is how I feel lemonguy was with this map.

At just under 2 minutes, this mid-level LN-control chart is incredibly engaging, and never makes it feel like a second of potential in this song was wasted. This map is first and foremost long-note biased like I just said, however there is a tasteful balance of rice mixed in which manages to both create more diversity in what you're reading, as well as bring a unique character to the map.

From the snappy 1/8-note rolls, to the slew of rice intermixed with walls of LN coordination, there's always something compelling happening with the pattern layering to make this map exactly what I think he was aiming for. Fun.

Great job to lemonguy as always, and make sure to vote for this fantastic map!

Chordjack fans fret not, for we have not forgotten you in a span of... *one wave*. Getting TLD himself and one of their most infamous packs out there was not enough. Not only that but, despite some people considering *[The Truth Never Spoken](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/808948)* by [\[Crz\]Rachel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8369409) to be speedjack, we also went ahead and put up a community favorite for Loved voting.

Those were only two of the MANY paragons of such following. So it is time to bring out Xingyue out on the spotlight! Their debut to Loved will be with none other than *[Kitsune no yomeiri](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1624095)*. Very intensive map with ~~what some might consider questionable~~ dense jack walls that will surely put your stamina to trial.

Good luck confronting the uprated challenge, *you'll surely need it*... Oh and ice. It's always nice having it handy if you hear a cracking sound on the wrong spot of your wrist!

If you're a fan of Camellia and are a 7K player, definitely make sure to check this mapset out. paradoxus has mapped lots of Camellia tracks, and we're really excited to add another Camellia chart to Project Loved along with the first entry from paradoxus!

*Upload Your Mind :: Download My soul* is as harsh as his other maps, showcasing delays, minijacks and chordstreams. To talk about the top difficulty here, the former drum sections in the song remains dense and is mapped in a harsh way, and the latter sections are well patterned and visually accompanied with rather some comfortable LNs. These patterns all lead up to the most intense parts of the map, such as the jack gauntlet in the first half, or the climactic LN walls in the second.

However, don't forget to also check lower diffs out on this set! The extra diff by Lude really stands out as one of the most well-structured and cleanly patterned, as they did a great job of differentiating one part of the song from another with very distinct patterning.

No doubt that this set is a good pick for Loved, so show paradoxus\_ and Lude your support this month!

For this month we bring you *Moon-gate* by DrLou, a huge set that caters to 7K players of about all levels of skill, and is also the first Loved entry from DrLou! Looking at what they've done here, it's truly impressive, because putting together a diverse set like this is no easy task.

Many players should be familiar with this song as it has a long history stemming from its original BMS life, although unlike the original BMS chart which was mainly introduced as delay patterning, the concept of this mapset is much more straightforward with its constant stream approach.

The lower and middle diffs begin featuring comfortable streams, and as you move further up in difficulty, you will see the maps introduce heavier chordstreams. To single out specifically the top diff, it may take you by surprise, since it tests both your stamina and bracket skills to an absurd degree.

Please don't forget to vote to support DrLou's hard work, and make sure to leave your vote for this great mapset!

Most 4K players should be well acquainted with this song due to Halogen-'s famous and old chart. However, we're nominating the 7K rendition here that has gathered a decent amount of popularity as well. Oh, and by the way, a different 4K spread is here too!

The majority of both 4K and 7K charts were mapped by ExNeko. There are also guest diffs from \_Stan, Tofu1222 and Ridho 2307 who cover the easier difficulties, and from Exlnyf who charted the hardest 7K difficulty. I'll focus mostly on ExNeko's and Exlnyf's charts here since they pack the heaviest punch in the mapset.

ExNeko's difficulties are themed around rolly and undemanding patterning. This is especially the case for 4K, where rolls and manipulatable handstreams are omnipresent, creating a simple and convenient stamina map with a respectable amount of density.

The 7K charts feature a similar style of patterning that is almost devoid of one-handed trilling and instead focused on stairy chordstreams. There are some occasional LNs in the easier parts which don't make much difference in the gameplay.

Exlnyf's 7K chart on the other hand is filled to the brim with uncomfortable and trilly chordstreams that make the player suffer, considering the song's high BPM. The initial chord part transitions into a chordstream section, which then slows down and gives the player the needed rest. The song culminates with a long 220 BPM stamina test.

*Unorthodox Red* is an accessible spread mapset that has been there for quite some time. While the patterning is not anything special in terms of quality, its consistent popularity, especially in the 7K department, made us nominate it. Now it has got its chance to shine, so go ahead and vote!

Ready yourselves for yet another serving of ruka's delicious LNs, as we're bringing you their chart of *Yoru ni Kakeru*!

*Yoru ni Kakeru* is a song that is already well-known in the community as we also just recently nominated [11Bit's 4K map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1211012#mania/2573488) of the same song, and this map over here rose to popularity pretty quickly just like theirs did.

This one is a collaborative effort that ruka did with Pengdoll, and it's worth noting that this chart is one of the most difficult to come from ruka. The map requires that players have some strong O2Jam fundamentals, as there's an abundance of shield coordination required to play it properly.

As the chart progresses, hints of what is to come are presented with short noodles and the inclusion of dump patterning, but even these more tame bits require your attention. Your finger independence and especially shield abilities will be put to the test in the harder bits! This is especially so near the final minute of the map where all of the ideas shown before come together for a climactic ending.

Show ruka and Pengdoll your support for this great chart that they made by giving your vote!

There it finally is. The legendary chart by Evening that has been extensively played by the upper echelons of the osu!mania 7K society, and equally as feared for being brutal and relentless. A chart that has seen the spotlight during 7K MWC 2017 Finals and has been the stage for [one of the most memorable matches of that tournament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJhHAZe-CFI). *PEACE BREAKER* enters the Loved voting!

Passing this monstrosity is already a big achievement. *PEACE BREAKER* begins slowly and builds up the pacing throughout the chart. Relatively dense chordstreams are consistently broken by stair bursts and sweeps of various snaps that eventually take over completely. and just like that the map becomes a burst doublestair fiesta... which is broken by even faster bursts.

Just when you're released from the first major section, you're instantly thrown into the hell of very quick and rolly LN stairs that are notoriously difficult to control. After that, the seemingly calm part of the song is contrasted with a relentless and very stamina-draining chordstream that only builds in difficulty and ends in a notable buildup.

The ending of the map is nothing short of insane, with even more bursts and doublestairs that are also intertwined with chordjacks of respectable density. HP 9 on this chart makes it very easy to fail, especially on some of the ultrafast stair bursts towards the ending. Even if you pass them, you need to have enough stamina required to survive the hardest part of the chart.

*PEACE BREAKER* is a chart that generates an incredible amount of hype as it progresses. It has been one of Evening's most influential works in 7K mapping, and definitely carries a great amount of legacy with it. It's only natural that it has been finally nominated. Good luck breaking your fingers!

*Shukusai no Elementalia* by Rora- is a classic o2style LN map. We're happy to nominate stuff from people who haven't yet appeared in the Loved section, so give Rora- a round of applause!

Now about the chart itself, there are two difficulties. Funnily enough, the Rice Dance, which is supposed to be focused on normal notes, has its decent amount of LNs outside of chorus sections as well. What's more, the OD is quite low, so that shouldn't be a concern when it comes to accuracy.

The chordstreams are very comfortable and pleasant to hit. Although Noodle Dance looks like an edited version of the lower difficulty, it's actually the main chart of the set. Chordstreams are changed into LN Walls which creates a very smooth and approachable inverse experience, something that's rather uncommon for 7K charts. If you don't care about getting into the leaderboards, playing this map with RD mod is a great way to train inverse patterning!

Although sadly the final (and the most interesting) part of the song is not mapped, the existing chart is more than enough to provide a great and clean LN experience. Whether you prefer rice or noodles, have a nice meal!

Do you want to expand your skills beyond 4K? Or maybe you're a 7K player and want to try something different? The *osu!mania 6K Starter Pack Vol.2* is for you then!

Featuring as many as 10 songs of different styles and levels, each player should find something they are comfortable with. There are charts focused on easy rice, long notes or mixtures of both. While there are some more demanding sections, they're not anything a determined player couldn't handle, unless they're really playing 6K for the first time. The song selection is pretty diverse as well, which further amplifies the experience.

We've put a few 6K mappacks into Loved in the past, including the prequel of this one. The 6K community is steadily growing and we want to provide more anti-meta content. Good luck to Arkman, \_IceRain, Alipay, Imperial Wolf and Syear!
