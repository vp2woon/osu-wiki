We're proud to pull **Emille's Moonlight Serenade** into the Featured Artist lineup!

Sporting the longest artist name you'll probably ever see, **Emille's Moonlight Serenade** (a.k.a. *Emiru no Aishita Tsukiyo ni Dai San Gensou Kyoku wo* or *Emiru3*) is a symphonic rock duo that's been blasting since 2011. Comprised of hyper-talented composer *Sala* and the vocalist without limits *Ibara*, the unit produces an intensely powerful classic Japanese & gothic-rock-esque sound comparable to our very own [Ariabl'eyeS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/93) and [ELFENSJóN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/69).

Considering how prolific this group has been, it only makes sense that we've gathered a hefty **64** songs for their [Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/160).

Keen ears might've already heard [*ito*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1077982) by [Lasse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/896613) through 2019's osu! world cup finals. For those who haven't though, watch [FlyingTuna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078) breeze through 158BPM spaced streams in the video below, then check out the rest of the previews:
