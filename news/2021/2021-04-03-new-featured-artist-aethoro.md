**Aethoro** joins the lineup as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/153/header.jpg)

Merging cinematic orchestral soundscapes with subtle electronic elements, **Aethoro** is a composer/producer known for the salient atmosphere behind each of their works. He draws heavy influence from a variety of game and film soundtracks, perfectly suiting his works featured throughout indie games and the content of his first narrative-driven album *Spiritdance*.

Each of these songs tells a story, so we've got **10** tales ready for mapping from [**Aethoro**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/153).

The genres explored in **Aethoro**'s music are fairly new to the Featured Artist library, so we super strongly recommend diving into these previews to see if this unparalleled sound is what you've been waiting for:

As per usual, [**Aethoro**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/153) is packed with a bunch more pre-timed songs, all waiting to be discovered by the world's next mapping hero (that's you! ...probably). Jokes aside though, these songs are really something special.

And that's all for now! We've got more awesome artists coming soon of course, so keep tabs on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) for news and whatever else we throw your way.

Until Wednesday!
