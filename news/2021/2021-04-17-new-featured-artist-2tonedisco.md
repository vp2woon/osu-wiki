**2ToneDisco** climbs aboard as our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/157/header.jpg)

A growing figure in both western and eastern EDM scenes, **2ToneDisco** is a producer known for his upbeat, *Dance Dance Revolution*-inspired electronic sound. Despite being based in Los Angeles, his music penetrates global boundaries through inclusion on Japanese label *Attack The Music* and performances at events like *Anime Expo* and *Miku Expo* with worldwide reach.

**10** tracks are up for grabs from [**2ToneDisco**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/157), most including collabs from a massive selection of other talented artists!

Speaking of talent, creators over at the Mappers' Guild have been hard at work designing [*2ToneDisco x Kabuki - Giga*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1392421) to introduce **2ToneDisco** to osu!. See how [MBmasher](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4498616) plays it using a new osu!lazer mod in the video below and check out the rest of these previews:

[**2ToneDisco**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/157) is where you'll find each of these songs plus a whole bunch more, all available as pre-timed beatmap templates. Crack your mapping knuckles and strike while the iron's hot.

Ever wondered how many beatmaps have been ranked specifically for these Featured Artist announcements? [Niva](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/197805) investigated the last 4 years of Featured Artist news posts and documented each relevant mapset in the [Featured Artist showcase beatmaps](/wiki/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_showcase_beatmaps) wiki article. It's a cool demonstration of the effort Mappers' Guild contributors put into these announcements behind the scenes, so check it out if you're at all curious.

That's all for now, but we'll be back again on Wednesday with another artist for you to drool over. Watch the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for updates and we'll see you next week!
