Showcasing a whole bunch of talents, electronic label **Tasty** joins the ranks of osu!'s Featured Artists.

Okay fine, you're right. **Tasty** isn't actually an *artist*.

**Tasty** is a music label who's worked with a massive number of artists throughout the last 10 years. We've picked up a handful of their awesome songs for use within osu!, including appearances from familiar faces like **Snail's House**, **Nhato**, **Laura Brehm**, and a *lot* more.

What exactly is up for grabs? The full list of **13** tracks is available from [**Tasty**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/221), so take a peek at that in case your favourite snack isn't anywhere in the previews below.

Speaking of previews, [-Sylvari](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3493804) from the [Mappers' Guild](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild) conveniently created a mapset for one of the lesser-known tracks in **Tasty**'s listing: [oneohkay - Last 7 Letters](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1616937). See how a rank 60,000 player manages the map with the Easy mod through the video below, then bestow your eardrums upon the rest of these previews:

Considering there's waaaaaay more artists involved in this new artist addition, we *really* recommend checking out [the artist's full listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/221). If the awesome music doesn't pull you in (which it will), you'll at least have access to super convenient pre-timed beatmap templates.

While today's release includes a bunch of different artists, Saturday's release will cover a hefty number of *songs* instead — specifically J-rock songs from an artist any osu! player surely knows. Look forward to that and keep tabs on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for an endless source of circle-clicking news!
