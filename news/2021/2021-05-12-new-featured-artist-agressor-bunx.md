**Agressor Bunx** joins the lineup as our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/164/header.jpg)

A trailblazer in electronic music scenes for a decade, **Agressor Bunx** is a Ukrainian duo with an insanely fierce sound. Developing their musical power over the years from a simple drum & bass feel to deeper neurofunk tones, the two talents have perfected their craft and are still managing to one-up themselves with each new song.

We've picked up a solid **7** tracks for today's release, each with a shorter ~2 minute version available from [**Agressor Bunx**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/164)!

No video this time around, but it's safe to bet that you've heard **Agressor Bunx**'s music already thanks to a popular beatmap of [*Tornado*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/236292) hosted by [Shadren](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/745494). On top of the classic *Tornado*, we've snagged a few of the duo's newer tracks as well!

Check it all out:
