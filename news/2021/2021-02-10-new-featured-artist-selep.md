We're proud to welcome **seleP**, the artist behind *Scarlet Rose* aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

Whether you're a new player or you quit half a decade ago, you're likely more-than-familiar with the works of **seleP** — a Japanese producer with a massive library of electronic VOCALOID masterpieces.

**seleP** took the osu! spotlight in early 2012 thanks to [val0108](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/243917)'s legendary beatmap of [Scarlet Rose](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/41686), amassing more than 8 million plays to date and a reputation as one of the game's hardest beatmaps at the time. Along with a [handful of other well-liked maps](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=selep), this artist rose to fame as a staple for the osu! community.

As of today, that legendary status has been officialized through **seleP** inclusion in our Featured Artists! We've got **24** new tracks ready for mapping spread across their 5 albums.

In case you're the one osu! player who still hasn't heard these songs (yes, I'm talking to you Tim), feel free to sample any of the previews or watch [Aireu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1650010) play with low approach rates below:

Each song above plus a truckload more are available from [**seleP**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/138), all pre-timed and ready to go. Just be aware that a few years after creating your popular map, you might end up learning English through Twitter memes like val0108.

Speaking of which, check out the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for news on the artist we plan to announce on Saturday! And the two we have planned for next week! And... you get the idea.

Until then!
