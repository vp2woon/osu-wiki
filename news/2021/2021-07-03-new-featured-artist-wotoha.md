We're proud to welcome **wotoha** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/178/header.jpg)

**wotoha** is the vocal talent behind an ever-expanding library of blood-pumping tracks not tied down by any one genre. Her online efforts began as a virtual YouTuber in 2018, but she's since shifted priorities towards music production, illustration, and animation as a member of new media group *OFUTONE*.

Ranging from hardcore to pop to jazz, we've snagged **10** of **wotoha**'s bright tunes, all ready for mapping from [their Featured Artist page](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/178)!

If you're late to the party, you can catch up by listening to **wotoha**'s fresh vocals through [*O108ROCKET feat. Neko Hacker*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1392416) mapped by [Murumoo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8001433) in the unnecessarily complicated stop-motion osu!mania video below:

[**wotoha**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/178) has even more songs to check out, each with timing done in advance so you can focus 100% of your thinking on how to design sliders instead. It's hard, we know.

That's all from the Featured Artist program for this week, but next Wednesday we'll be back with monster-sized release from an artist you already love. Stay tuned to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) for details and circles and whatnot.

See you next week!
