We might be blooming a little late this year, but the Spring 2021 Fanart Contest is finally here! If you like to draw, check this out for fun and (possibly) prizes!

That's right, it's that time of year again! The time where we summon the osu! community's talented artistic side forth in a glorious test of their creative skill.

As was the case for all of 2020, we'll be continuing the special themes for the Fanart Contests in 2021, with Spring's being the following:

**Draw any of the official osu! mascots or community mascots enjoying a day in the park during Spring!**

You might be wondering what a day in the park means, and it is with great joy that I can say: it is up to you! So long as your piece is mostly outdoors, features an osu! mascot (official or community) and is themed around Spring, you're good to go.

Here's some suggestions to get your creative juices flowing:

- Picnicking
- Rowboating on a lake in one of those stupid swan boats
- Conversations on a park bench
- Feeding the birds (and things going comically wrong, or not)
- Lying on the grass, cloudwatching
- Skipping rocks on a lake
- Reading books under a tree
- ...and anything else you can think of that involves Spring and being in a park!

Got an idea in mind? Great, because you've got **14 days** from the date of this post to make it happen, after you have **READ EVERY SINGLE RULE BELOW** like all good contest participants should, and because you're reading this news post thoroughly and not just glancing at it after someone mentioned it to you on Discord, right? RIGHT?

As always, a top selection of the highest voted entries will make it to the main-menu in the osu! game client*s* (both the current game AND osu!lazer's preview builds) as our Spring 2021 Seasonal backgrounds, earn their artists 3 months of osu!supporter and a shiny new profile badge featuring a teeny tiny snippet of their winning piece.

Now, on to the rules:

## Rules

- **By submitting your artwork to this contest, you grant us permission to use your artwork in the main menu client should it win, and to use it in promotional material for both the game (osu!) and the contest (Spring 2021 Fanart Contest).** You retain all rights to your creation and you can sell it and distribute it however you like - it is your work, after all. We're just saying here that if you submit your piece to this contest, you should be okay with us using it.
- **All entries MUST be themed around a day in the park during Spring, and feature at least one official (or community) osu! mascot.** What this park is and what happens in it is entirely up to you, but it should mostly focus on outdoors-style activities being undertaken by any one (or more) of our mascots.
- **All entries MUST be suitable for all-ages viewing.** I would ordinarily make a challenge here about how there's no way someone could make a walk in the park lewd, but I've been running these contests long enough now to know better. Keep it clean!
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK. REDRAWING AND COMPOSITE WORKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** Plagiarism sucks. Don't do it. Someone in the comments will call you out for it as has happened every other time someone's tried and they're going to do more damage to your reputation than us removing your entry from the voting will do. Use only your own work - brushes and the like are fine, but that's it! Don't redraw someone else's work.
- **ARTIST ATTRIBUTION (names, social media handles, etc) MUST BE LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THREE LINES TOTAL AND CONFINED TO EITHER THE BOTTOM LEFT OR BOTTOM RIGHT CORNERS OF YOUR ENTRY.** Being proud of your work is good, just do it in a reasonably small spot of your work. Please understand that we're not very fond of anything ad-related in osu!, and attribution that is blaring enough can be considered as one.
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece - namely 2732x1536. THIS IS CHECKED BY A SCRIPT AND ENTRIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE DISCARDED AUTOMATICALLY.** This is the #1 reason for entries not making it to voting phase. MAKE SURE YOUR ENTRY MEETS THE EXACT RESOLUTION REQUIREMENTS ABOVE. Check your work after you've exported it and BEFORE you submit it. People have been really good about this during the past few contests, please keep it going!
- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed on the main menu and during the voting process.** Anything you draw that is inside the dotted circle won't be seen during voting phase, because we super-impose an osu! cookie over all entries during voting phase to simulate what they're going to look like on the main menu. Please accommodate for this in your drawing!
- **DO NOT LEAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR SUBMISSION!**
- ***DO NOT LEAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR SUBMISSION!***
- **DO NOT LEAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR SUBMISSION!**
- **Don't use copyrighted characters from other intellectual properties.** All the official osu! mascots and the community mascots are fair game, but please avoid using representations of characters from other worlds or franchises in your work. Remember also that the community mascots are someone else's treasured creation, so please treat them with the same respect that you'd treat your own OCs and work.

Got all that? Great, we knew you would. When you're ready to submit your entry, head on over to the [Spring 2021 Fanart Contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/125) drag your piece onto the big fat plus sign to put your entry into the running. You can do this multiple times if you need to update your piece any time before entries close in **14 days** time.

Good luck and most importantly - have fun!
