**SECONDWALL** jumps in as our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/137/header.jpg)

A band with energy and emotion sure to get your blood pumping, [**SECONDWALL**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/137) is a Tokyo-based rock group with a genuinely refreshing rock/pop sound. The combination of talent from their 5 member lineup and their heavy influences from both J-pop and international rock staples has led to a truly authentic and attention-grabbing sound from each of their works.

The band released their first album in 2018, from which we've snagged **all 10 tracks**!

Let's cut to the chase. You want to hear what you'll be mapping 5 minutes from now, so give any of these previews a listen (and give their accompanying maps a play!):
