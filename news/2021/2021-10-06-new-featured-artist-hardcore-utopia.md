While it's not quite right to call the **HARDCORE UTOPIA** albums a "Featured Artist", we're nonetheless happy to add **50** blood-pumping new tracks to our Featured Artist library!

For those out of the loop, **HARDCORE UTOPIA** is a set of free compilation albums organized by *Kara* whose goal is to showcase independent artists throughout the rhythm game scene! Their songs span across some of electronic music's most hype-inducing subgenres like *UK hardcore*, *artcore*, *J-core*, and much more-core.

We've snagged all that we could: **50 songs** from **42 different artists** that were released through **HARDCORE UTOPIA**'s three breathtaking albums. Check it all out from [**HARDCORE UTOPIA**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/205).

**HARDCORE UTOPIA** is no stranger to the talents behind osu! mapping. Its third album was announced alongside a bunch of beatmaps from some of osu!'s most notable mappers, perfectly demonstrating how these songs translate to rhythm games.

See what we mean for yourself:
