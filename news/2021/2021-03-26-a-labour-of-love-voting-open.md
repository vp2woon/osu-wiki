Parade your love for a timeless osu! classic. Vote for your favourite submissions in this multi-layered contest!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-11-30-a-labour-of-love/alol_cover.jpg)

For the uninitiated, [A Labour of Love](/wiki/Contests/A_Labour_of_Love_Contest) is a contest inspired by one of osu!'s most iconic beatmaps: [**Kuba Oms - My Love**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/163112).

Talented mappers, musicians, and visual artists in the community teamed up to create super cool beatmap experiences with each of these elements:

- Remix of the song **Kuba Oms - My Love**
- Beatmap spread following the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)
- Storyboard or custom video

Contest submissions ended earlier this month, so now it's your turn to vote for the best of the best!

## Vote

[**Vote for your favourites HERE!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/115)

Based on input from our mapper and musician judging panels, 14 valid entries were narrowed down to the **top 8**. Your role is to select up to **2** entries you enjoy the most!

So what happens to the entry with the most votes? What are the prizes?
