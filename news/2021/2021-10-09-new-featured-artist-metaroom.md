Enter the **METAROOM**.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/206/header.jpg)

Transcending all genre stereotypes, **METAROOM** is a California-based producer with a penchant for anything and everything surrounding fast-paced and complicated electronic music. Each of their tracks explores an unfamiliar landscape with references to breakcore, footwork, and jungle music, as well as inspiration from notable experimental artists like Iglooghost and Hakushi Hasegawa.

[**METAROOM**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/206) is a cool place to be with **15** songs up for grabs. While you're there, you could even say you're in the **METAROOM** room. But you really shouldn't.

Behind the scenes, [Lugu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12851847) from the Mappers' Guild has been hard at work creating a [showcase beatmap](/wiki/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_showcase_beatmaps) for today's artist announcement. See how it turned out alongside osu!lazer's new built-in Performance Points counter, then check out the other previews below:
