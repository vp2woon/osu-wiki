**love solfege** joins the lineup as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/171/header.jpg)

Boasting a musical style self-described as "classic art pop", **love solfege** is a Japan-based circle responsible for a distinct sound you'll surely never hear anywhere else. Each of their tracks intertwines elements of classical music, rock, pop, and R&B through efforts from composer *Shinichiro Matsumoto*, all of which are perfectly harmonized with a wide array of vocal performers.

**10** songs are up for grabs from [**love solfege**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/171), each exemplifying their classically inspired style in a way that perfectly suits osu! mapping. Grab 'em while you can (which is forever, by the way).

Although they've technically been part of the osu! world since 2011 through the beatmap [*arabesque of dif.*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/22742), **love solfege** didn't truly catch the community's eye until mid-2020 via [*Vanity Clock*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/609057). See what all the fuss is about through a combo video of [Vaxei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4787150)'s No Mod and Double Time scores, then listen to the rest of the previews below:
