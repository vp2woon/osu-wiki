Dive into a crowd of *Kantai Collection*-inspired tracks created by **KINEMA106**, our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/222/header.jpg)

**KINEMA106** is a powerhouse in the doujin sphere. Throughout the last 6 years, they've earned a valuable reputation for creating extremely catchy J-rock songs accompanied by beautifully illustrated anime-style music videos. While most of their early works drew inspiration from the *KanColle* franchise, they've recently been expanding to other franchises like *Fate/Grand Order* and even fully original content!

We're in for a big one this time. **37** top-notch songs have been prepped for your eager mapping fingers and are available on [**KINEMA106**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/222)!

It should come as no surprise that **KINEMA106** is popular among circle clickers. This brand of J-rock is essentially in our blood at this point, so we've organized a ton of maps for you to explore (most of which come from the swell folks over at the [Mappers' Guild](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild)).

Take a look for yourself:
