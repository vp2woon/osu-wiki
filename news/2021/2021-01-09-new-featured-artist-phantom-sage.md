We're proud to introduce **Phantom Sage** as our latest Featured Artist!

Sage Douglas began producing music in his early teens under the stage name [**Phantom Sage**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/129) as a journey through the boundaries between EDM and ambient soundscapes. Rising to prominence with releases on the online label sensation *NoCopyrightSounds*, his works have made an impact on countless individuals throughout the last half-decade.

Taking a step away from electronic music production in recent time, **Phantom Sage** has sprung to fame on TikTok as [*fntmsage*](https://www.tiktok.com/@fntmsage), where he covers songs throughout the genre spectrum for his 1.8 million followers.

Celebrating his older works here on osu!, we've snagged a collection of **10** songs for your choosing, including classics like *Holystone* and *MIKO*.

Not familiar with **Phantom Sage**'s songs? Worry not — [WillCookie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6404488) is here to show you how a top player manages on a map of Sage's music (albeit with some handicaps).

### Holystone

Give [this osu! set](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/515297) by [sheela](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1138027) or [this osu! set](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/514942) by [Nozhomi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2716981) a play, both part of the 2nd French Beatmapping Contest!

As per usual, everything above and much more is waiting for your mapping magic over on [**Phantom Sage**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/129). Songs are pre-timed of course, so there's really no reason not to get started. We're expecting at least 3 maps per mapper by tomorrow, otherwise you're all fired.

We're super excited about Featured Artists we have planned next week (and every other week, to be honest), so be sure to follow the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for news on what's coming up.

See you next Wednesday with another Featured Artist!
