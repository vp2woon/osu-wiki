**Pratanallis** slips into the lineup as the latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/175/header.jpg)

Guiding their own twist of symphonic rock to osu!'s front stage, **Pratanallis** is a multi-genre circle drawing from sounds like gothic rock, baroque classical, anime songs, and the breadth of doujin music surrounding them. Their four released albums sport some of the strongest sounds in the scene, featuring compositions by the group's lead *Hinode* and familiar guest vocalists like *Tsuyuri Karin*, *Sakuya Kurosaki*, and *Meramipop*.

We managed to pick up **12** songs from their extraordinary catalogue, all of which are available for the taking from [**Pratanallis**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/175)!

**Pratanallis** only recently found a home on osu! thanks to a beatmap by [Adinda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15959751) of [*Braking Down*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1307632) (and no, that's not a typo). Give it a try if you're up for a stream-heavy marathon, and if not, enjoy watching a bunch of other people attempt it with Sudden Death below:

Everything above plus a bunch more can be found from [**Pratanallis**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/175). Timing is done in advance of course, so you can instead focus your thinking on how your sliderends are never truly lined up with stacked objects. It's a curse and we're not sorry.

What's planned for next week, you ask? Two new artist announcements, you guess?  Sounds like we might be a bit too predictable, so we'll be switching things up after next week. Stay tuned to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for all the details on our upcoming artists and whatever else we're vaguely hinting at. See you soon!
