2020 was osu!'s biggest year for mapping - ever. Have your say in helping decide the Community Favourite in all four game modes and vote today!

Every year since... a very long time ago, we've held an annual poll called the Community Choice wherein the osu! community all gets together, huddles around a campfire and feverishly discusses their favorite maps with one another, before rushing off to cast their vote.

Okay, maybe the campfire thing doesn't actually happen, but the voting thing absolutely *does*, and everybody reading this post has **10** of said votes per game mode to go out and cast **for any map that they played at least once during 2020.**

Our contest system will automagically produce a list of maps that you're eligible to vote for, all you need to do is choose your favorites, send them a star, and you're done. Easy.

The top 10 most popular maps in the vote for a given game mode will be officially declared as the Community Favourites, with the number one entry earning its mapper **6 months of osu!supporter** and a shiny new profile badge to celebrate. All other entries in the top 10 will receive **1 month of osu!supporter**.

As a little something extra for this year, **we'll be tallying up an extra award based on the votes of everyone who has at least 1 Ranked map.** We're affectionately dubbing this as a bootleg Mapper's Choice Awards in a bit of an experiment to see how things turn out. If you're a ranked mapper, you don't have to do anything different - just vote like normal, and we'll be using your votes to help decide a special **Mappers' Favourite of 2020** award to go alongside the Community Favourite mode. This applies individually to every game mode's vote, of course.

Sound like something you want to get in on? Check out the links below to head to your game mode(s) of choice, and get to voting:

The polls will remain open for **14 days** from the date of this post. For the younger ones among us, this is what people used to use the word "fortnight" for before 2018 happened.

Get in quick... or else!
