It's that time of the month again! [Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) presents a new batch of Loved nominations, and it's up to you to decide whether or not they make it in!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)

For those unfamiliar, Project Loved hosts monthly votings to decide which nominated maps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). You can click on each of the map's banners in this post to go to its poll on the forums. More info is on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved)!

Over the last month, we've had a few changes to our roster of captains:

First and foremost was the departure of [nyanmi-1828](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6866480), one of the longest tenured osu!taiko captains with nearly 2.5 years of work in the role. He's been winding down his osu! activity and decided it was time to leave Project Loved as well, but I don't think his impact on it will fade away any time soon!

With nyanmi leaving and osu!taiko losing its staple Japanese presence among its captains, the rest of the team decided that [KuroKuroKuro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11931563) would be a great fit for the role, and they'll be helping decide osu!taiko nominations going forward.

Last but not least, [Kawawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4647754), who you probably already know from their insane dedication to literally everything in osu!mania, is joining the osu!mania Loved captains!

And now onto the part you clicked here for, the maps! ~

[Chikamori Kayako - Kigurumi Sungeki](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1315615#osu) by [GranDSenpai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3997580)\
185 BPM, 3:04 | 7.83★

With all the jump maps out there in the graveyard, it takes something special for a map to rise up in popularity, and this map has arguably even exceeded that. At nearly 8 stars in difficulty, a solid 185 BPM, and nearly 500 favourites to back its name, it's no surprise why this map has quickly grown a reputation as one of the most satisfying jump maps in the game. On top of the map's quality, the song feels so fitting I'd be surprised if the singer herself wasn't jumping across the room while singing it.

This one's for all those sessions where you just wish you had the perfect map to let out all your jumping energy.

74 BPM, 1:51 | 3.43★ – 4.92★

With all the intense energy the maps in this game can provide, sometimes all you need is a step back from the chaos and just let it all out. Or, if not that, maybe just appreciate the fact that even the most memed-on Japanese songs end up being such bangers. Regardless, I'm sure we can all agree that a song like *Baka Mitai* deserves nothing less than an incredible mapset to do such an incredible song justice, and that's exactly what iRedi provided with this mapset of Hard and Insane difficulties that players of any skill level can enjoy.

Introducing your new multiplayer pocket pick.

[Camellia - Night Raid with a Dragon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1024370#osu) by [ponbot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8939857)\
128 BPM, 3:19 | 6.83★

As our beloved Camellia has developed as an artist, some mappers seem to have improved even more, being able to keep up with Camellia's HARDCORE bangers with equally hardcore maps. If you're not really sure what I mean, just know that this map by ponbot provides one of the most unique and high quality tech map challenges I've ever seen. A nearly 7-star boss battle of a map, the intensity seems to never truly die down as the map throws masterfully crafted technical alternating, finger control, aim control, high BPM bursts...

If you think you've seen all that technical maps have to offer in this game, I'd suggest thinking twice about that if you haven't tried this one.

172 BPM, 6:20 | 6.48★

Such ambitious collaborations on technical marathon maps seem hard to come by nowadays, but that doesn't mean we can't still look back in awe at just how incredible some of those kinds of maps are. A collaboration between 15 stunningly skilled mappers led to this 6-minute masterpiece being created in 2017. Since then, it has only stood the test of time, exceeding quality standards of even modern mapping.

Topped off with the highest quality hitsounds and storyboarding, it's about time this map has gotten a chance in the spotlight it deserves.

107 BPM, 2:35 | 7.91★

With all the stream maps that exist in this game, it's hard to make streams that feel both unique to your map and high quality at the same time, yet that seems to be FaiVillager's secret talent, as it's never stopped their maps from having the freshest and most satisfying gameplay experiences to come out of the graveyard section. This map's kiai sections are graced with nothing but uniquely addicting 222 BPM streams backed up by an electronic song that only makes the patterns that much more satisfying to play.

Expect yourself to be coming back to this map for years to come.

226 BPM, 2:22 | 1.02★ – 9.06★

Tired of your favourite Featured Artist songs only having impossible maps? This mapset is here to remedy that, featuring a balanced spread of 21 difficulties ranging between 1 and 9 stars. No matter your skill level, there's a difficulty in this mapset that'll perfectly challenge your skills at an insane 226 BPM, each one beautifully capturing the chaos that screams its way out of every second of the song.

There's a certain kind of map that seems almost impossible to get right, and that's making a really hard map for a really slow song that still feels like it's not overmapped, and this whole mapset hits the spot right in the bullseye. This full spread of 6 difficulties peaks at a 6.5 star top difficulty that's characterized by its kiais filled with 1/6 jumps at a mellow 115 BPM.

Catchy songs need catchy maps, and catchy maps deserve the best players playing them. You know what to do.

212 BPM, 3:00 | 7.56★, 8.11★, 8.13★

One of the first 8 star graveyard maps to ever shine in popularity, this catchy, 212 BPM Japanese song accompanies some of the most notoriously long jump sections of its time. The clean mapping style lends itself perfectly to type of map you'd expect from a song like this, and the map is fully hitsounded for the best gameplay experience.

There's a special charm behind those giant mapsets of short, silly MP3s that get a bunch of wacky guest difficulties, but most of them fall in the dust of obscurity in the graveyard, likely to be forgotten with time. Not this one, though—with 17 difficulties, nearly 400 favourites and almost 200,000 recorded plays, this mapset found the sweet spot between innocent fun and actual playability. Enjoy a solid 33 seconds of autotune charm that gets sillier the more you listen to it.

Sadly, that such thing does not exist in real life... but look at this beatmap of *ClariS - Hitorigoto -TV MIX-* mapped by asuasu_yura and his friends! A well-known anthem of anime sisters is here just for you!

This old best-seller beatmap has always been popular for many players. As it has a wide diff range from 4.13\* to 8.61\* along with eleven diffs, this map won't ever disappoint you, no matter what diff you would like to play!

Do you like tech maps? Do you want more of them? I highly recommend 7_7's *hello can you hear me*. If you've listened to this before and thought it was a cute song, please be careful. This map is 200 BPM and consists of 1/4, 1/6, and 1/8 doublets, making it a very challenging yet rewarding map. Also hidden in this map is a little fun with barline gimmicks. It's a great map that will keep you engaged until the very end, and I hope you enjoy it!

Kobaryo is a name that doesnt need any introductions, we all know what he's up to and this time is not different: *Night of Core* uses clear references to the Nightcore genre along with the usual Kobaryo sound to make one of his best songs for sure. As if that's not enticing enough, Nishizumi picked up this song and made one of the best speed maps there is, making use of very straightforward patterning techniques and overall clean structure, presenting us with such a treat at 345 BPM, 100% fun beatmap and 0 unfair patterns!

Players, the time has come to open the box! This map created by Grape_Tea has many innovations, such as complex snaps using 1/5, etc., but the most notable is the barline gimmick. To be honest, if you can see the string "BPM0-infinite", you already know there is a gimmick... but you won't understand the beauty of this map until you play it. Now, try opening the "box". No one knows what's in the box, or what will be left after you open it...

This week we have a mapset made for a bigger audience, covering a bigger variety of difficulties, ranging from a Rain all the way up to an Overdose/Deluge. While the Platter and My Virginity difficulties aren't "fully" mapped but rather cut short, creating a somewhat TV-Size-esque map, they are still enjoyable maps to play covering quite a few patterns that should challenge some of the newer (and maybe even the older) player. I personally think the Rain difficulty will give the more spinner-orientated players a run for their money, as the map doesn't just contain a few spinners, but a grand total of 10!

What I think the best part is about this mapset, is that you can see the difference in mapping styles when you look for example at the Collab Overdose and Our blood, 2 years later (which I can only assume was made 2 years later after the earlier difficulties) is the vast change in patterns. Both difficulties have their own style which gives a nice touch as well as give you a nice look in the past and present regarding mapping.

Will you conquer the map by washing your blood away in all the spinners trying to fight for the #1 spot on the map, go for a regular full-combo on one of the difficulties, or go with a whole different twist and try to "pass" the map while dodging ALL fruit?

While Fauzen's difficulty being promoted in AxS 5th Edition, both of the difficulties in this map of *Hype* are providing enjoyable patterns, especially for the top players. They're mostly focused on burst 1/4 streams, which require a precise and sharp movement. A single mistake can lead you to a fail on this map, so it's also recommended to play with No Fail mod if you aren't familiar with 1/4 streams yet. You can also take Hidden mod into account since it would be helpful with training your precision.

Alright, though the background was changed quite literally last second, I believe that everyone recognises this map. It's *that* very iconic map from Nelly, coming in hot as his first nomination for Loved! For the post-2017 babies in osu!catch that have never laid their eyes upon this map: this is a fairly difficult and very jumpy map that was used as a pick in the final stage of the CWC in 2017, and has been a popular pick in multiplayer lobbies before that too. Most players on the higher end of the skill spectrum should be more than fine with playing this though, especially with a few retries, and the top end players will also be able to enjoy this map with HR and/or HD.

We brought the madness (of course I would make that pun), now it's time for you to bring your mouse on that download map button and check it out!

Many of you probably know this map because of its presence in the nomod bracket of the 2016 osu!catch World Cup final. It certainly has been a while hasn't it? While it isn't as difficult anymore for the players today as it was for the players 5 years ago, that doesn't mean that the map lost its value. It is overall a really clean map, with the most notable part being the jumpstream section that can make you fail instantly if you make a mistake. I'd have loved to see this map in the ranked section one day but it is clear that this will never happen so it is time to give this map the exposure it deserves through Loved. Make sure to give it a try!

*Yura-Yura Sweet Genocide*. If you were an osu!mania player active in 2015, this map should bring back some memories. Being used in Grand Finals for MWC that year, this map was absolutely brutal for its time. Jumpstream at 260 BPM with 1/8th bursts intermixed is still ruthless even today, so imagine being one of the players who had to actually play it in match all those years ago. spoonguy didn't hold back with this one, much like you shouldn't hold back on casting your vote!

[Kairiki Bear - Inaiinai isonshou (feat. GUMI, Kagamine Rin)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/663472#mania) by [juankristal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/443656) and [Ciel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1455309)\

A name all too familiar to high-end tournament players and veterans, the formidable *Inaiinai* approaches, a staple end-game long note chart by none other than juankristal himself. A collab with Ciel, this chart ignited one of the most well-known traditions in MWC, a "timing hell" long note map—comprised of challenging, complex releases and fast long note patterns—appearing in every subsequent finals pool thereafter. However, this chart was more indicative of a broader shift in osu!mania's meta as a whole, driving a large portion of the layerbase towards long notes. As such, this monumental chart with great history and significance is a no-brainer for the Loved section.

[II-L - VANGUARD-1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1055051#mania) by [Elekton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4990211)\
170 BPM, 1:55 | \[4K\] 4.08★\
*description written by [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576)*

VANGUARD-1 by Elekton is just about as technical of a map as you're going to get at this level. Filled with complex rhythms, this map heavily tests your finger independence, accuracy, and control. Rhythmic fluency is crucial in this challenge of a map, so be wary! Because of the unique challenge that this map poses to even the best of players, it has grown to become quite popular, which is why we nominate VANGUARD-1 for the Loved section.

*Entrance* makes its entrance finally to Loved. Uploaded back in August of 2014, this set has always been immensely popular in these past 6+ years since then. As for the diffs, there's something here for a wide range of players. The 4K Easy to Hard difficulties provide some decent introductory patterns, while the 4K Insane incorporates jacks and some bursts with a very tricky ending. 7K players also get something here with the 7K Another, which is mainly focused on chords and stairs along with the same spiky ending. Needless to say it's been a long time coming, and we are glad to finally get this one out here!

[Mili - Ikutoshitsuki](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1427571#mania) by [Flexo123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5367287)\
86 BPM, 3:22 | \[7K\] 3.72★\
*description written by [Penguinosity](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10235296)*

*Ikutoshitsuki* is here to bring 7K players some relaxed long note patterns, to an equally relaxed song. Flexo123 has done a great job here making a map that can appeal to many types of people. The map strikes a balance between laid-back and challenging, as throughout these 3 and a half minutes you will always need to pay attention to release timing. Some tasteful and unintrusive SV also works its way into a few spots, making this map even more dynamic and enjoyable.

[Xe - Satori Maiden \~ 3rd Eye](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/344771#mania) by [Kawawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4647754)\

*description written by [lenpai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5314573)*

A legacy pick for this round, Kawawa's *Satori Maiden* has been one of the staple charts for practice for anyone trying to get comfy around the expert level of rice notecharts. Gaining traction from an earlier iteration of the 7K Dans, as well as plenty of multiplayer lobbies back in the day, anyone who has played the game for quite some time would easily recognize this map—for good reasons! The chart at its core is takes influences from BMS with its huge chord usage and brackety chordstreams but with a personal spin maintaining a degree of comfiness even with the occassional bursts and minijacks at 145 BPM. If you haven't tried this map yet, do give it a shot!

*description written by [Kawawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4647754)*

quicalid4 presents a large 7K pack in *7K utattemita pack2*, consisting of a wide variety of rice and long note patterns for all sorts of players. This sort of pack will act as a test of skill for more experienced players. With high BPM rice, inverse patterns, and dumps all thrown into the mix, it makes for a really interesting challenge!
