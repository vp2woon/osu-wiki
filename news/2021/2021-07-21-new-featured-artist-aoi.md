We're proud to welcome **Aoi** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/183/header.jpg)

Presenting a storm of rhythm-game-y beeps and boops, **Aoi** is a Japanese producer whose works can be found in all corners of the music game world like *SOUND VOLTEX*, *jubeat*, *maimai*, *Arcaea*, and *MUSYNX* — just to name a few. Inspired to compose music by rhythm game legend DJ YOSHITAKA, **Aoi**'s tightly packed songs provide a canvas for timeless maps.

**14** tracks are sitting at your doorstep and ready to be loaded into the editor. Your doorstep, of course, is [**Aoi**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/183).
