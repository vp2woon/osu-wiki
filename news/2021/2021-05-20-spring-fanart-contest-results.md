Spring is the season of prosperity and new life, something the artists in the osu! community really took to heart in our latest art contest. They had one not-so-simple task: draw any of our beloved osu! mascots enjoying the park in this season of bloom.

And boy did they deliver.

Over **120** talented creators stepped forth and threw their work into the ring, creating the terrible but wonderful agony for the rest of us that is choosing only **15** of them to vote. But now, those painful times have passed, and we're ready to celebrate the finalists as chosen by all of you.

Without further ado, here they are:

Taking first place and the hearts of **5697** voters by storm, [**Tofumang**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4817223) continues his well-deserved winning streak with his beautiful rendition of a lounging pippi enjoying some of nature's beauty in a park.

Those of you who have followed these contests religiously will know Tofumang well by now for his uniquely wonderful artistic excellence, something that has continued into this contest as well. From positioning to colour, linework and more, his work remains simply exceptional, and it is no surprise to any of us that he continues to hold a dominating presence in these contests with pieces like this.

Astute observers may see something suspicious in this image if they care to look, among other things...

Contest newcomer [**Kyvrin**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11589256) blasts into the scene with their utterly transfixing take on a sundress-toting pippi enjoying the great outdoors with sea, ground and sky motifs, earning a whopping **5517** votes in the process.

Talk about a fearsome debut! This piece was tied for (and briefly overtook) first place multiple times throughout the contest, with some days showing an absolute neck-to-neck race to the finish with sometimes as little as *less than twenty* votes between them. Crazy stuff.

Kyvrin has put a serious foot forward here with their first ever entry, and we certainly hope to see them again in future contests!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/banners/risuuna.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/winners/risuuna.png)

**4777** voters couldn't help but be wooed by [**risuuna**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7266506)'s pippi and her adorable smile as she shares some of the comforts of a pristine river with a pogfish and a lounging don.

Cute and funny is a well-established winning combination in these contests and for damned good reason, as risuuna demonstrates here all too well.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/banners/Sjao.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/winners/Sjao.png)

[**Sjao**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7295733) returns again to snag **4437** votes with their utterly gorgeous take on a springtime pippi getting some reading done in a butterfly-laced park beneath a tree.

Well known for their outstanding use of colour and light, Sjao continues their streak of standout performance among our fanart contests, and we couldn't be happier to welcome them back.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/banners/Porukana.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/winners/Porukana.png)

[**Porukana**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12992775)'s interesting take on Mocha and pippi enjoying the spring rain wowed **4406** voters, and for very good reason!

Creative use of the broad settings we offer is always welcome, and we're delighted to see Porukana nab a well-deserved place among the finalists after a storied history in many of our other art contests. Witnessing an artist's improvement in real time is a wonderful thing, and we're excited to see where they take their craft in the future.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/banners/xxxxxx2800.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/winners/xxxxxx2800.png)

[**xxxxxx2800**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4084853) continued to impress **4079** voters with their sauntering pippi strolling with a parasol through a floral field in muted pastel tones.

This one was stylistically breathtaking and a real journey in contrast to many other pieces in the contest. xxxxxx2800 has been a finalist a few times now and their talent for the craft really, really shows.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/banners/Dreamxiety.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/winners/Dreamxiety.png)

Fanart contest veteran [**Dreamxiety**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233) scored **3889** votes with their brave portrayal of pippi enjoying some springtime fun on what we've titled as 'those stupid swan boats' at the start of the contest.

Jokes aside, Dreamxiety absolutely killed it with this one, showcasing their rapidly growing command of art to create a piece with some of the most well-executed water and light elements that we've seen to date. Seriously impressive stuff.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/banners/lutfi_anims.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/winners/lutfi_anims.png)

[**lutfi_anims**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11041959) turned heads and took the names of **3883** voters with their standout debut entry showcasing an utterly adorable Mocha and pippi all decked out in traditional Japanese attire among a flurry of sakura petals flowing in the wind.

It is so very, very difficult to stop looking at this piece. Absolutely outstanding work and we dearly hope to see more from them in the future!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/banners/PacifiedPaints.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/winners/PacifiedPaints.png)

Continuing the trend of cuteness overload, [**PacifiedPaints**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8377453) followed up with **3749** votes as people could not help but appreciate their stunning take on a very fashionable pippi (and duck) chilling out in a spring sunshower.

A certain colourless feline also makes a cameo appearance here as a logo on what we presume is a bespoke line of osu!-related clothing.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/banners/McFriedFries.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/winners/McFriedFries.png)

Dappled light enchanted **3197** voters in [**McFriedFries**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12694139)' picnic piece sporting pippi, Mocha and Chirou enjoying some time (and burgers) in the sun.

There's just so much going on in this piece that it's hard to praise all of it in only a few short paragraphs. Absolutely stunning, and more than deserving of its place in the finalists.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/banners/Poring.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/winners/Poring.png)

**3107** mesmerised individuals found themselves lost in [**Poring**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14743626)'s urban cityscape vista alongside a uniformed pippi in what we now take to be a still shot of the canonical osu! universe, complete with A Labour of Love billboards flying in the distance.

I'll break from tradition here a little bit to mention that this was one of my personal favourites in the entire contest due to how wonderfully stylized, crisp and clean it is. Everything about it feels so delightfully *deliberate* in a way that is hard to describe but very easy to appreciate.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/banners/araran.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/winners/araran.png)

**2767** voters succumbed to the charms of [**araran**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8937198)'s catgirl pippi set to a light-infused backdrop of vibrant sakura trees and clouds.

With the one-two punch of gorgeous background and cute mascot all wrapped up in some serious artistic chops, it's no surprise that araran's first fanart entry ended with a spot among the finalists.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/banners/Jinairu[Sensei].jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/winners/Jinairu[Sensei].png)

**2651** voters approved of [**Jinairu[Sensei]**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10932731)'s take on all of the official osu! mascots (and Chirou!) lounging around on the springtime grass for a feature shot.

You can sure bet that nobody is going to let Mari live down the fact that she fell asleep during this, especially Mani most of all.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/banners/Ayamy.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/winners/Ayamy.png)

**2635** people stopped to marvel at [**Ayamy**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10275467)'s take on a blooming pippi undertaking what appears to be a bread run in the midst of a sunlit, springtime day.

Nothing further will be mentioned, especially not the low-hanging fru--damnit.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/banners/ShovelKun.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/125/winners/ShovelKun.png)

**2406** voters were taken by the hand to a land that they could understand by [**ShovelKun**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9948284)'s most adorable take on Mocha out on an evening springtime walk.

An extra special mention goes out to the creative use of theme here - to my knowledge, nobody else delved into the evening element quite so deeply, and it really produces a stunning result here overall.
