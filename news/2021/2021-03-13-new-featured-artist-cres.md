Timeless classic **Cres.** joins the fray as our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/147/header.jpg)

Holding the rhythm game spotlight for 15 years and counting, **Cres.** is the producer responsible for *End Time* — a stream-heavy song that practically every osu! player is familiar with.

This masterpiece was produced for 2006's *BMS OF FIGHTERS* event, and while it's been popular since then, it was only featured in rhythm games like *maimai* and *CHUNITHM* a couple years ago. Since then **Cres.** has shifted towards producing background music for non-rhythm games, drawing inspiration from major composers like *Uematsu Nobuo* and *ZUN*, while also sticking to his roots by taking notes from *KONAMI* games between 2000-2010.

We snagged **14** tracks from this producer paragon, *End Time* included of course.

If you're one of the three osu! players who hasn't heard **Cres.** yet, worry not! [zonelouise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1492995) and [Aistre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879380) are here to show off this electro-trance sensation, so check out the video (or any other previews) below:

You know the drill. Everything above and MUCH more can be found on [**Cres.**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/147). Tedious timing for each song is prepared in advance, so you jump straight into the slightly-less-tedious mapping part!

That's all for now, so where do you go from here? Assuming you've already started mapping your favorite **Cres.** song, sliding over to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) and waiting for next Wednesday's new Featured Artist is a pretty solid choice.

Anyway, see you next week!
