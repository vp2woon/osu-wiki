An addiction stronger than circle clicking, **Symholic** takes the stage as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/130/header.jpg)

Who would've guessed that combining heavy rock with angelic vocals would sound so good? **Symholic** apparently did, and has been composing symphonic masterpieces since all the way back in 2012. Reminiscent of our very own Featured Artist [*Ariabl'eyeS*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/93), we're sure this tragic rock sound will be familiar to practically any and every osu! player.

We've hit the motherload this week. **47** tracks across 9 albums are available from [**Symholic**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/130), including vocal performances by familiar names throughout the doujin sphere and osu! scenes alike.

Need some convincing? We've got a handful of maps ready for you to run through, plus a neat preview showing exactly what it's like to play **Symholic**'s pieces.
