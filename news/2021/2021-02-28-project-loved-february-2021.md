[Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) is back to bring your monthly dose of your favorite maps from the grave. Do they deserve your love? Decide their fate in this month's vote!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)

In case you need a refresher, Project Loved hosts monthly votings to decide which nominated maps get added to the [Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved) category. You can click each map's banner to be taken to a thread where you can vote whether or not you want that map Loved. Voting is open for 10 days, starting now! You can read more about how Project Loved works on its [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved).

Before we get started with this month's selections, the [Project Loved Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Project_Loved_Team) would like to bid farewell to one of our long-time osu!mania captains, as TheToaphster—also known as [Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811)—has retired from their position. Having been the lead of the osu!mania Loved scene since before some of us can even remember, they helped shape osu!mania's Loved section to what it is today. Their contributions will not be forgotten and we thank them for their hard work. With their departure comes a new arrival as [Penguinosity](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10235296) has joined the osu!mania team!

With that out of the way, here are our picks for the month of February.

*description written by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

Feast your eyes—and your fingers—on one of the most intense and high quality jazz maps this game has ever seen. The mapset features two difficulties, both around 7 stars, and they feature some of the funkiest and most satisfying stream and finger control patterns out there, accompanied by an absolute banger of a song. If you're a fan of good times—and who isn't—this is a map you need to play at least once.

So there's complex rhythm, and then there's this: 2 minutes of polyrhythm constantly switching rhythm with no mercy, masterfully structured by none other than ktgster. All emphasis on rhythm here, and at nearly 7 stars, it's targeted to the best of the best—it's up to you to see if you can keep from getting tied up.

*description written by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

It's a high honor for your map to be considered the "epitome" of a certain skill, and this map in particular is considered by some as the epitome of speed. At 255 BPM, AR 10, and over 7 stars in difficulty, this map does not let up in intensity throughout its 2-minute duration with its unforgivingly frequent bursts and streams. If you want to put your speed to the test against the best of the best, this is the map you're looking for.

*description written by [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050)*

Speedcore intensity on a mechanically draining map—if you've heard the song before, you know how this map is going to play. 256 BPM, over 8 stars in difficulty, and all the bursts and jumps you could ever dream of. A 5 star version is also available for those who can't quite keep up. In short, this map is a high-speed mechanics test at its absolute core.

"overmapped, unplayable..." says the beatmap description - but 8 years on, does this still hold true? Hailing from all the way back in 2013, this was one of the many challenging maps made by Aqo to push the limits of players of that era. Old patterns, interesting angles and a guest difficulty from GoldenWolf to boot, come have a go and push yourself on this forgotten gem.

Awkward linear patterns at a fast pace, another classic that the newer folk among you might not have seen before but those who have been around a while will love to play again. Three minutes of 6-star alternating goodness, with both an AR 9.5 and an AR 10 version to keep everyone pleased. If that sounds like your kind of party, this isn't a map you'll want to skip.

270 BPM is nothing to scoff at regardless of difficulty, but what does it look like when it's taken to the extreme? This map answers that question all too well, with relentless bursts and streams fired at the player thick and fast, a real test of your stamina at incredibly high speed. Can you last until the end of the map?

Are you confident in your stamina? Do you think you can break through every stamina map? Do you have cool muscles and want more stamina stuff? Well, here's a good beatmap for you.\
Plua-'s *Disappearance Addiction* has brutal patterns which will challenge your stamina, rushing towards you at 294 BPM of speed. What? Are you disappointed that this map doesn't go over 300 BPM? You'd better not underestimate this.\
The \[Stamina Addiction\] difficulty's patterns won't give you ANY second to rest. There are as many as 2,901 notes densely mapped in just 3 and a half minutes. Can you feel how dense the notes are? Give it a go. This stamina thing won't be the same as anything you've ever tried. To everyone trying this beatmap, good luck to your arms!\
If your stamina isn't enough to pass the \[Stamina Addiction\] difficulty, there are other difficulties requiring less stamina, nicely mapped too. The lowest SR one still has 1,947 notes to hit, but at least you can have a fighting chance at this map...maybe?

*description written by [X a v y](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3738344)*

While the BPM isn't particularly fast, the map features various groups of bursts. Even though the bursts are monocolor, they are snapped to very technical and challenging time signatures as improvisation, which makes for a very unique style of improvised mapping. The mapper doesn't shy away on using unconventional time signatures and offhand patterns in his work. Additionally, like all his other works, his backgrounds are self drawn to provide even more creative input and an additional layer of personality to the map.

Ever since Socus' first appearance in the Loved section, we've wanted to put even more of their maps here so that everyone gets to experience one of the best mappers in the Japanese scene. This time, not only have we decided to bring *TWISTSTEP* into the mix, but also one of his most popular maps, *Angel's Salad* by katagiri. Even though it's apparently "only" 177 BPM, this map falls more into the category of "high bpm tech" due to their constant 1/6 and 1/8 usage, which ends up becoming an incredibly bursty map that requires not only just good reading skills to nail those tricky patterns, really high SV notes and the barline gimmicks that are so popular as of late, but also an insane amount of stamina and speed to hit them since they just keep coming and coming, matching the absolute chaos this song is.

*Possessed By The Blood Moon* by ReeK is a very cool song and reminds me of the final boss in a game. This is a very unique map that attacks you with difficult but fun 1/4+1/6 patterns, SV, bar line gimmicks, and more. I think you'll be surprised, especially at the end. I don't think there is any other map at all that is as fun and can be played as many times as this one, so I hope you will play it for yourself and see how fun this map is. You won't regret it!

Ah, what a nostalgic one. Back in 2014 things were much simpler for osu!taiko: you'd find a lolicore song you like, map a lot of 1/6 bursts and 1/4 streams to it, call it a distinctive name and you'd end up with a surefire banger that would endure the test of time. And boy has this this formula sure worked for Kurokotei, as *LeaF Style Super Shredder* was one of their most popular maps of the EX'S ULTIMATE CHALLENGE series, which we are very happy to announce is coming to the Loved section for all our beloved aliens in the community!

Today we have a newcomer to the Loved category, KuroRev, with a map that a lot of people will know the song of: *Intersect Thunderbolt - Remix*. KuroRev has been mapping for quite a while now, mapping a big variety of maps, and now their first potential Loved map!

With this being mapped back in 2017, it was considered something of an "impossible" map to play back then, but since players have steadily become better and better it is actually now playable for most (if not all) higher end players. Just listening to the song (or even just looking at the song title) should give you a rough idea how hard the map  will be. It is filled with constant hyperdashes, left right jumps, zig zags, direction changes, you name it! Due to the fast pace of the song, you will not have any time to take a breather, as it is a constant flow of notes coming your way.

Can you get an FC on this map, or perhaps get Red Eyes from playing the map so many times that you can even pass it with Flashlight?

Howdy fruit lovers! We're back with another cool double BPM map by rew0825, which is fairly well-known in the community already.

Despite being mapped in 2018, this map hasn't aged in the slightest and still remains very interesting to play. Vocals are nicely represented with long sliders, combined with 1/4 bursts which makes the map in general much more exciting to play. They are challenging yet comfortable to play thanks to rew's clean mapping style. If you haven't played this map yet, despite having been featured in a LOT of multiplayer lobbies, you should give it a try this time!

*description written by [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)*

Yet again, Minato Yukina is making a return to the Loved category with *eicaTV vs kanone - MG277*.

This map has seen quite some plays back in the day, and even in the current year! Back in 2018 it was even picked for the osu!catch Solo Carry Tournament as a Nomod pick in the Grand Finals. This should probably give you somewhat of an indication of how hard the map is. Due to the nature of the song, of course the map is gonna be focused around speed. It starts out relatively calm, but don't let that throw you off as the patterns at the start require you to have pretty precise movement, giving you very little room for error. About 75% of the way in, the map speeds up a lot, introducing left to right jumps, streams, and to top it all off at the very end a small hyperwalk pattern to throw you off just a little bit more.

Do you dare to go to war with this map, or perhaps go back to Overwatch?

After quite the wait we are able to welcome Emiru back into the Loved category! The French powerhouse mapper is well-known for making very spicy maps, but his most well-known project is likely his dan project, where he puts a plethora of his own maps and guests difficulties into a single pack, which tests the player on a single skillset.

The dan packs each test one of the following skillsets: marathon-play, jumping, tech-patterns, speed, and a boss dan pack that combines all those skillsets together into one fearsome package. This round we have got the first marathon dan (and his first dan in general) lined up for you lovely ladies and gentlemen, so you can have some fun breaking your fingers and getting muscle cramps over 6 map difficulties that each, on average, are a whopping **7 minutes long**! As the difficulty between these maps ranges quite a lot, there is plenty to be seen for players on both the lower and higher end of the skill spectrum.

So stop doing those other "marathons", like running, or anime-binging, as they are soooo 2020. Check out this dan instead will ya?!

125 BPM, 3:46 | \[4K\] 3.30★, \[4K\] 4.63★

XeoStyle's set of *FLO* is something that many mania players old and new have enjoyed. The set has been around for nearly 4 years, and has maintained a consistent audience since its initial upload. The two difficulties here have something for both kinds of players. Xeo's \[Gallados\] diff, is a gauntlet of very technical speedy dumpstreams and jack bursts which will put players reading and accuracy to the test. Hydria's \[Hard\] difficulty on the other hand, is a much more tame experience in comparison; putting more of an emphasis on testing a player's pure accuracy and release timing abilities.

It's easy to see why this set has garnered so much notoriety over the years, providing two well-made charts that appeal to a wide variety of players.

*VANESSA* is an all-time classic mania set that many players should be very familiar with. Quick Draw's initial upload of the set dating all the way back to July of 2014, means that this will be turning 7 years old this year. During said 7 years, *VANESSA* has always held an immense amount of popularity and it's easy to see why. Both the \[4K NM\] and \[4K HD\] difficulties provide some good introductory-level patterns to newer mania players looking for a challenge. Meanwhile, the \[4K MX\] difficulty is throwing out some tricky one-handed patterns, jack transitions, and a few absolutely brutal long-jacks. Let's also not forget about the 6K difficulty here, which is loaded with some brutal bracket patterns. *VANESSA* has retained consistent attention over all these years, and it's a clear decision for us to put this up for Loved.

And here we have it—LeiN-'s *beepbit \* futures*. A super fun-filled single stream extravaganza with a playful, lighthearted song by AAAA and Frums, *beepbit \* futures* is an instant hit among higher level players. The map, which was featured in the finals mappool of MWC 2020, is filled with streams at a whopping 375 BPM (250 BPM 1/6 snaps), with a few light 1/3 jacks and 1/4 jumpstreams scattered about, and short 1/8 bursts at the ending. This map is overall an enjoyable experience for how difficult it is, which is why this map certainly deserves its spot in the Loved section.

136 BPM, 2:41 | \[4K\] 2.55★

Raveille's magnum opus, *Chicken Attack*—over two and a half minutes of slow-paced long note patterns and tricky releases. Players across the board will find some sort of challenge within this with maintaining precision in timing the releases. It's this reason that *Chicken Attack* is used in so many tournaments, which is where it quickly gained its popularity as a tournament cult classic. It's about time this map got a spot in the Loved section.

*Sink to the deep sea world* with sankansuki's amazingly difficult 7K map. Coming in at nearly 4 minutes in length, this is a relentless hybrid chart that pulls absolutely no punches with its density. Players who are up for the challenge will be experiencing 3 chord brackets, lengthy long note burst sections, and some longjacks all at 185 BPM. It's no wonder why a map this brutal was used as the Final's tiebreaker in 7K MWC 2019.

[V.A. - osu!mania 6k Starter Pack Vol.1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/850880#mania) by [Arkman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8814590) et al.\
184 BPM, 2:55 | \[6K\], 2.13★ – 4.08★

Arkman's *osu!mania 6K Starter Pack Vol.1* is a collection of maps from various notecharters that are geared towards intermediate players ranging from Hard to low Insane difficulties with a general emphasis towards finger independence, burst control, streaming, and heavy chord usages with some other skillsets also utilized to a smaller degree. The amount of attention and play this pack has received has been particularly notable as it has come out to be one of the most played within 6K which solidifies its position for this month's Project Loved voting!

The \[Xoz's Infinite II\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.

Fullerene's 4K map of *LeaF Style Super Shredder* is as classic as a map can get. This chart garnered a lot of attention in mania back when it was used in Finals for MWC 2015, but the chart itself dates back to 2014 where its first release was seen in the now legendary Stepmania pack, "Yolomania Vol. 3". As for the patterns, this short map has a lot to offer as it constantly switches up much like the song does. Being loaded with speedy bursts whether it be minijacks, two-hand trills, or jumptrills, the map should still pose some challenges for experienced players all of this time since its creation.
