**Yuyoyuppe** thrashes their way into the Featured Artist roster!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/132/header.jpg)

Considered by many as a founding father of vocaloid rock/metal, [**Yuyoyuppe**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/132) is a DJ, producer, and singer with an incomparable library of creative works. While he launched into the music scene over a decade ago with an iconic combination of vocaloid emotionally heavy rock, he's since expanded into pop and techno pieces under the alias *DJ'TEKINA//SOMETHING*, and has made major contributions to the composition and arrangement for songs performed by the immsensely popular band *BABYMETAL*.

We've managed to secure **18** tracks from their **Yuyoyuppe** and **DJ'TEKINA//SOMETHING** aliases (plus 3 more tracks from their older [MOtOLOiD](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/19) listing). We can guarantee that you'll recognize at least a few of them, like *Palette* or *Leia*.

One of these tracks is already iconic among osu!'s speediest players: [*Hidamari no Uta*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/831242) mapped by [Seto Kousuke](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2857314). We asked [yasen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6879408) (the highest ranking player on the map's leaderboards) to show us his streaming limits as part of a quick song preview below:
