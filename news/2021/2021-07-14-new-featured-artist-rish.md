We're proud to welcome **Rish** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/181/header.jpg)

Embracing the combo of hyper-intense instrumentals with high-pitched cute vocals, **Rish** (a.k.a. *rissyuu* / *Risshuu*) is a long-time contributor to the rhythm game scene with an unmistakable style. Their songs are spread throughout games like *Muse Dash*, *maimai* and *SOUND VOLTEX*, plus they've recently gained a wave of new fans through their *BOFXVI* submission "Take" in late 2020. Everyone knows **Rish** at this point, and their fame is well-deserved.

We're excited to announce **13** of these cute tunes, all up for the taking from [**Rish**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/181)!

For those who somehow still haven't heard **Rish**'s sound, that's about to change. Take a peek at, uh, [*Take*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1376486) mapped by [yf_bmp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1243669) with a more-than-appropriate bamboo theme, then explore a few extra songs below:

[**Rish**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/181) is the place to go for more of what you just heard! All songs are pre-timed of course, so you can spend your own time on more important things — things such as mapping, beatmapping, and possibly even crafting your own beatmap.

Well folks, it looks like we've reached the end. There's no way we can go up from here. All the best Featured Artists are already announced.

If that's what you're thinking, you're dead wrong, so keep an eye on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for the proof. We'll see you on Saturday with another artist release!
