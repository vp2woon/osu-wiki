We're proud to welcome **Geoxor**, our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/133/header.jpg?2020-01-24)

Creating timeless electronic hits from his bedroom for the better part of a decade, [**Geoxor**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/133) is a Greek producer with an undeniable talent for high energy, euphoric melodies and eardrum-pounding bass.

We've hit the motherload with **33** total tracks, ranging anywhere between glitch hop to drum & bass. With a sound comparable to the likes of our very own Featured Artists [Panda Eyes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/55) and [Teminite](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/64), there's no doubt you'll find something to your taste.

Don't take our word for it though. Preview a few tracks to see if **Geoxor** is your cup of tea, or see how his music translates to mapping through [Zer0-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4260033)'s mapset of [*Stardust*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1349715), as demonstrated by the differences between 2 digit and 6 digit gameplay.

Any new maps on your horizon? Skip a few steps by heading to [**Geoxor**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/133) and downloading any of the pre-timed beatmap templates. One of them might even come packed with an autograph by Geoxor himself! But probably not. They're just maps, sorry.

That's all for now, but make sure to keep tabs on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) for more info about next week's Featured Artists (and your precious pp updates).

See you next Wednesday!
