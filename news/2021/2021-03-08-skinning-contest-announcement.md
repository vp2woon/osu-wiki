Skinners, this one is for you! Create your finest skin! Why? Because it is your time to shine!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-08-skinning-contest-announcement/skinning_contest_banner_announcement.jpg)

Skinning has been one of the most notable features of osu! since forever. Whether it be an elegantly designed anime-themed skin, or a super simple and minimalistic one, everyone has their own favourite. However, the very creators of these masterpieces still remain unknown by many people. Therefore, now it is time for the skinners extraordinaire to come forth and show off their skills!

Hosted by one of the largest skinning communities, [skinship](https://skinship.xyz/), the contest is apt for both experienced and inexperienced skinners, with no theme restrictions whatsoever. In other words, everyone is allowed to join with a skin of any theme!

Are you interested in joining but new to skinning? Fear not! Nearly everything you need to know is available at our [skinning tutorial](https://skinship.xyz/tutorial/introduction). If you need further assistance, feel free to visit the [skinning forums](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/15) and consult other fellows!

## Participation

If you're reading this, you're probably interested in participating too. So let's dive into it!

In order to participate in the contest, you will have to create a brand-new skin all by yourself, ready to compete against skin creators from around the globe!

In addition to the skin, you need to prepare a forum thread accommodating it. That's right, you can't just submit your skin file and run away, but also need to present your skin in a forum post however you like. Said forum thread must be located under the [Skinning WIP subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/119).

Since all entries will have their respective forum threads publicly available, contestants and their submissions will not be anonymized. In fact, we encourage you to show off your work as much as you wish!

## Voting

After the submission phase is over, the entries will be made available for community voting.

The results of the community voting will determine the winner of the contest. Entry with the most votes wins!

## Schedule

"When?" you say? Right here and right now! The dates will become clearer, just pay attention to the following.

- Submission: **4** weeks starting from the release of this news post
- Voting: **2** weeks starting from a separate news post

## Rules

Please pay attention to the following bullet points, as violating any of these rules may result in disqualification.

- Submissions must not contain inappropriate, malicious, or epileptic content, and should adhere to the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules).
- All assets need to be created by yourself, or used with permission and proper credit to the authors. This includes, but is not limited to:
  - fonts
  - icons
  - textures
  - artworks (e.g. stock images or anime artwork)
  - sounds
- The majority of the in-game menu interface and at least one game mode have to be skinned. In other words, in addition to the gameplay elements, the following segments shouldn't be left default:
  - Ranking Panel
  - Song Selection (excluding the mode selection)
  - Mod Icons
  - Pause and Fail Menu
  - Main Menu is optional, but highly encouraged
- Submissions must be new creations, only skins posted within the submission period will be accepted.
- Each submission must be accompanied by a forum thread in order to participate in the contest.
- Submissions must be made in time. Latecomers will not be accepted.

## Prizes

Obviously, we couldn’t call it a contest if there were no prizes, but worry not! The prizes are marvelous, and surely you’re getting excited to see them the further you read. Without further ado, behold, the prizes!

The creator of the winning entry will be awarded **6 months of osu! supporter tag** for their success! However, it’s not only that. They will also receive a **shiny new profile badge** to show the world who’s the boss (of skinning)! The design of this badge will be based on the winning entry, for our winner to pridefully exhibit their token of success!

Despite falling short of achieving the most votes, becoming a runner-up is no easy task. Therefore, we will be compensating the efforts of the 2nd-place holder with **4 months of osu! supporter**, too!

We hope you’re still reading, because we’re not finished! There’s still one more spot on the podium, and we can’t just let them go without a prize. Achieving the 3rd place will be rewarded with **2 months of osu! supporter**!

Hopefully, these prizes will encourage our fellow skin creators a little bit. May the best skinners take the podium!
