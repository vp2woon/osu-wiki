**La prière** blends the vocal talents of *nayuta*, *Natsume Itsuki*, and [*Aitsuki Nakuru*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/127) as the latest addition to our Featured Artists!

Combining some of the highest caliber vocalists with composers and arrangers known throughout the rhythm game scene, **La prière** is the unbelievably talented group responsible for songs that tick every box in the "perfect osu! map" checklist. Since their first release in 2019, the three-vocalist unit has created two full albums and a collection of singles, all of which maintain top-tier production that you'd come to expect from a crowd as stacked as this.

We've snagged **11** tracks across their discography, all freely available for mapping from [**La prière**'s Featured Artist page](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/174) in their pre-timed glory.

Despite being comprised of some of the biggest names surrounding the rhythm game scene, **La prière** surprisingly hasn't had much attention from osu! players until recently. You might need to investigate their sound for yourself, and this video of [*Senjou no Utahime*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1398580) showcasing osu!lazer's newest mod is a good start (along with the other song previews below, of course).

The rest of **La prière**'s pop-filled tracks can be picked up from [their Featured Artist page](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/174). Given the wide spread of composers behind these songs, the official osu! statisticians propose that there's a 96.4% chance you'll find a song that you like. Everyone also knows the osu! statisticians don't make up numbers. That'd never happen. Definitely impossible.

An earthquake could wipe out half the world's population tomorrow, but we guarantee that we would still announce a new Featured Artist this coming Saturday. Stay tuned to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for all the details and we'll see you then!
