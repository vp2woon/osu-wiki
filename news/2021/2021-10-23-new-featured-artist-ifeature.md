Feast your ears on **iFeature**'s hype-filled sound!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/210/header.jpg)

Providing the highest volume of pun opportunities since the start of the Featured Artist program, **iFeature** is a German producer and self-proclaimed "hybrid-human" best known for his own brand of emotional electronic dance music. Since his launch in 2014, he's pumped out 3 full albums and countless singles with collaborations from other talents in the EDM world like *ReeK*, *ST4RBUCK*, and *Phastrom*.

**10** incredible tracks are up for grabs from [**iFeature**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/210), so take your pick and launch the editor for a healthy dose of circle-themed inspiration.

**iFeature** debuted on osu! last year through a beatmap of [Over You](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1094434) hosted by [DeRandom Otaku](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5156153). Even if you're one of the 375,000 people who've played it already, this video showcasing the map with osu!lazer's No Scope mod will be a new experience anyway, so check it out along with everything else here:

Did you notice the redesign of Featured Artist pages? Of course you did, since you've already visited [**iFeature**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/210) and downloaded one of the ultra-convenient pre-timed beatmap templates. Regardless, it's looking pretty cool.
