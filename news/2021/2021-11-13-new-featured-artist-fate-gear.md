Immerse your eardrums in the steampunk universe designed by **FATE GEAR**, our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/216/header.jpg)

Founded in 2015 by the group's guitarist *Captain Mina*, Tokyo-based **FATE GEAR** is a female-only rock & metal band whose sound has earned international praise. With 4 album releases to date and countless live performances (including a massive tour through Europe in 2020), **FATE GEAR**'s expertise is meeting the rhythm game scene for the first time!

**14** tracks showcasing everything **FATE GEAR** has to offer can be found from [their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/216). Feel free to start mapping if your circle-clicking withdrawal is kicking in already.

If you can hold on a bit longer, experience **FATE GEAR**'s sound for yourself through this mod-oriented video and the rest of these maps + previews!

And of course, there's one more thing to consider before returning to your high-velocity-reverse-slider-pp-farming session. Could it be [**FATE GEAR**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/216) which conveniently provides pre-timed beatmap templates so you can cut straight to mapping? Or is it something else entirely? We'll let you figure that out.

If you're new around here and you want *even more* songs to map, you'll be happy to learn that we announce two new Featured Artists every week! The [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) is a neat way to learn about all that, so keep an eye on it and we'll see you when we see you.
