**garlagan** steps up to the plate as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/212/header.jpg)

Sharing a background similar to most osu! players, electronic rock producer **garlagan** grew up playing tons of video games. Sparked by his experiences in *Castlevania: Symphony of the Night*, **garlagan** has always been fascinated by the connection between music and gameplay, and his iconic music + art styles aim to showcase that relationship!

**16** eclectic tracks can be found on [**garlagan**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/212), so pick your favourite before it's too late! (Note: it's never too late because these songs are available forever, but you should start mapping anyway.)

Start exploring **garlagan**'s unconventional sound through an unconventional medium: *beatmap physically painted on canvas*. Once you're done questioning our video content choices, feel free to check out the rest of the song previews too:

Ever hear of [**garlagan**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/212)? Sources say it's a solid place to go if you're looking for new songs to map — especially if you'd rather not time the songs yourself. Do whatever you want with that information.

In other news, the [Featured Artist track search](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/tracks) finally exists! Your mental encyclopedia of osu!'s 4000+ Featured Artist songs can finally be tossed in the garbage.

We'll be adding even more tracks to this massive search list next week (and every week after that, of course), so stay tuned to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) for all the details.

See you on Wednesday with another Featured Artist!
