We're proud to introduce our newest Featured Artist **Aiobahn** into the mix!

Hopping between electronic-themed Japanese pop and English EDM, **Aiobahn** is a South Korean genre-fusing producer and DJ with practically limitless talent. Launching his career through releases on Japanese net-labels and later advancing into the worldwide spotlight through a *Rocket League* track released through *Monstercat*, **Aiobahn** continues to impress year after year.

We've managed to secure **11** stellar tracks from their catalogue, all freely available from [**Aiobahn**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/166) for your endless mapping needs.
