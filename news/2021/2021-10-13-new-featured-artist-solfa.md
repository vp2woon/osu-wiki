**solfa** jumps into our Featured Artist listing!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/207/header.jpg)

If you've been playing osu! long enough to actually read our news posts, there's a 100% chance you've heard **solfa**'s music.

With humble origins as producer *iyuna*'s solo project 15 years ago, **solfa** has since transformed into a collaborative project with numerous features in the visual novel sphere and involvement from some of the doujin scene's most renowned vocalists like *yuiko*, *Chata*, *Shimotsuki Haruka*, and *Ceui*.

**solfa**'s anime-esque sound is exactly what countless osu! players have come to associate with the game, so we're pumped to finally have **33** songs officially available from [**solfa**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/207)!

We'd usually post every ranked map featuring a new artist below, but considering there are [a TON of ranked **solfa** beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=featured_artist%3D207), we'll spare you. Instead we'll offer quick previews of a bunch of different vocalists, along with an attempt of [popner](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/759860)'s classic beatmap [*solfa feat. Chata - Colorful precious life*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/90854) on mobile osu!lazer:

Featured Artist fun fact: to secure just ONE of our artists earlier this year, we exchanged more than 250 emails! On second thought, that's not very fun. The [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) is much more entertaining, so keep tabs on that and look forward to news about our next Featured Artist on Saturday!
