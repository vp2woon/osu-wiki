Electronic record label **Tiny Waves** joins the Featured Artist lineup!

Working with artists throughout the EDM scene since 2015, [**Tiny Waves**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/131) is an all-in-one record label, events promoter, and artist support organization housing an endless pool of talent. While their primary focus is on electronic genres with video game, chiptune, and anime-inspired compositions, the label prides itself on how none of its artists are limited by genre.

Given **Tiny Waves** is a *record label* rather than a specific artist, we managed to snag a collection of tracks from a *ton* of artists. More specifically, we have **13** tracks featuring collaborations from a total of **17** unique musicians!

*Kabuki* and [*MYLK*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/62) are two of those artists, and their recently mapped track [Talk 2 Me](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1293770) by [Gero](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1467715) below serves as an example of how perfectly **Tiny Waves** music converts to osu!.

Everything above and muuuuch more is pre-timed and ready to go from the [**Tiny Waves** Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/131). Or maybe we should call it a "Featured Label listing"? Maybe not. Doesn't sound quite right. Let's stick to "Featured Artist". Thanks for the feedback.

That'll be all for our belated Saturday-Sunday release (you can thank the recent pp updates for the strategic delay), but make sure to watch over the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for the details on next week's artists.

Until then!
