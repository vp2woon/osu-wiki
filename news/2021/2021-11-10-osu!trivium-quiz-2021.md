Sick of not being able to win any tournaments because ~~Vaxei~~ you don't have enough skill? Like an aged fable that preaches brain over brawn, this might be the competition for you!

Dubbed as "the world's hardest quiz on osu!", the osu!trivium Quiz is an annual competition featuring 50 osu!-themed trivia questions. The questions are all designed to be "un-google-able", meaning you cannot just copy-paste the question along with "osu" into a search engine and expect to find the correct answer.

[**QUIZ**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSimRjdnJJtS8UdBgTiGTGbuhZLlJHyDvuA7jaRsF2GRVlM9Girj9hC8iikgowk2u8LAV6a2HWqBjDr/pub) | [**FORUM**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1459493) | [**DISCORD**](https://discord.gg/2A2g4fMuD3)

The deadline for submissions is **December 13, 2021 (12:00 UTC)**. Players may participate in up to teams of 4. For more details on registration and submission, please refer to the quiz document or the forum thread linked above.

## FAQ

Below are answers to some questions we anticipate from the participants. If your question is not answered here, please feel free to ask [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718) on the aforementioned Discord server.

### This quiz seems impossible! Where do I even begin?

This quiz is intended to be incredibly difficult. Last year's winning team only managed to score 84 points out of the maximum of 150. That being said, a good place to start would be to rewatch the VODs from the previous instalment of the quiz (these can be found on the forum post or quiz document).

### Is there any question that requires knowledge from participating in the previous year's quiz?

No. There will be no advantage gained (other than experience) from participating in previous events — we aim to have a level playing field.

### Why am I not allowed to ask peppy for answers?

peppy is incredibly busy and unless you want osu!(lazer) to replace stable by 2037, it would be best to not flood his inbox with questions that he doesn't even know the answers to.

Fun fact: peppy ended up writing a scripted response to everyone who emailed him during last year's osu!trivium quiz.

### When will the answers be released?

Once all the submissions have been evaluated, the answers will be livestreamed on Twitch. We expect this to take place on the weekend after the submission deadline, though this obviously depends on the volume of submissions. Be sure to keep a close eye on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) so you don't miss it!

One final note: please do not discuss the answers to the quiz in the comments below, or in any other public setting. It will ruin the experience for everyone participating — your answer might not even be correct!

Without further ado, good luck and happy trivia hunting!
