[Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120)'s monthly set of maps that need YOUR help to get a leaderboard is here! Come vote for your favourites... or else!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)

For those unfamiliar, Project Loved hosts monthly votings to decide which nominated maps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). You can click on each of the map's banners in this post to go to its poll on the forums. More info is on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved)!

Lately there has been a lot of discussion in the `#osu-loved` channel of [osu!dev](https://discord.gg/ppy) about changes to Project Loved, big and small. While not much has gone into effect yet, I want to outline some of what we're working on so you know what to expect and can jump into the conversations if you're interested:

- I'm working on [a website](https://loved.sh) with the goal of bringing together the various sheets, forms, information, etc. related to Loved in one well-organized place. Since my first focus was on management tools for captains, there aren't many public pages, but they will be coming very soon.
- [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207) recently organized a usability testing program to help understand what we need to focus on to make Loved more understandable and usable as a category. So far results from that are great, as we've already confirmed some suspected issues and learned about new ones. This month I'm going to try to fix and add things on the osu! website that should help solve those issues.
- Overall there is some sentiment that we want to make significant changes to the Loved process and presentation, which at largest scope could involve completely redesigning the category—definitely look out for these conversations in `#osu-loved` if you're interested, and please share your thoughts. These are just some ideas floating around right now and no actual plans, but as we make progress on the above two points we'll shift focus to getting more serious about this too.

On top of these developments, we've got some new captains this round! Say hello to [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084) for osu! and [Alter-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4980256) for osu!mania. Both are extremely skilled players that are excited to share awesome maps here!

You also may have noticed that the [Project Loved group](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/31) on the website is public and we've all got group badges now! This should make it easy to identify captains (look for the mode icon in the badge) and get in touch with people involved with Loved.

That's all for the monthly update, now let's get into those maps!

[Umeri - paranoia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/724881#osu) by [Sakurauchi Riko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5710809)\
150 BPM, 3:47 | 6.23★, 6.62★

With inspirations from the Ranked 2014 mapset of the same song, *Umeri - paranoia* is a serene song accompanied by 150 BPM, high-6-star streams with ever-changing difficulty.

A perfect balance between cut streams, spaced triples, and slider rhythms, this map is a challenge for even the best players' flow aim. Throughout its 4 minutes, the map's style stays consistent yet increases gradually in difficulty, all leading to an ending that will push you to the limits of what you've learned throughout the map. Including both CS 3.3 and CS 4 difficulties, hopefully you will all be able to find enjoyment in this wonderful map.

207 BPM, 3:21 | 7.06★, 8.06★, 8.23★, 8.24★

*Hana - Sakura no Uta* has resounded its bells throughout the community since 2015, with this mapset of the song being no exception. Sitting at 207 BPM as a 1.15x rate speed-up of the song, the difficulties range from low-7★ to 8★, with every single one offering a challenge for your aim. Multiple spikes line the map with squares, triangles, and overall geometric jumps, fitting together cleanly.

With three of the difficulties being made a year apart starting in 2018, and a guest difficulty following in 2020, this set provides exactly what you would hope for in an aim map. These Verses of the Sakura Tree I hope to see entertain those who play for the years to come.

150 BPM, 4:45 | 6.51★

From another explosive song by one of our very own Featured Artists, a mid 6-star tech map arises: *Camellia feat. Nanahira - Rawstyle Bomb*.

Sitting at 150 BPM, challenging players with slider tech transitioning into 1/3rd and 1/6th alt-burst sections, this 4 minute map gives little time for rest. Although pairing these vastly different styles of play, *Rawstyle Bomb* flows between the two excellently, creating a fun and upbeat experience. By Nanahira's lyrics, "Come on, sing along!", for all who have the pleasure of playing.

180 BPM, 6:14 | 5.82★

Failing to be permanently ranked in 2015 after a tragic unrank, this map previously known as *Summer Wing 2013* comes back for a warm reunion to those awaiting its arrival.

Another *Love Live!* song hitting the Loved section, this map has consistent jumps with slightly awkward angles, as well as triples and doubles spread evenly throughout. All of this makes for a relaxing experience, so simply ride along and enjoy this map's belated redemption arc. For old players and new, I recommend you give it a try.

145 BPM, 4:39 | 1.83★ – 6.87★

1/6th swing jazz mapping or maybe even memories of a *certain* 2018 mapset are daunting enough, but all the maps in this set deliver.

With the difficulties ranging from 2★ to high 6★, this collab set caters to all skill levels, while the higher tiers are all but filled to the brim with high velocity sliders constantly yanking back and forth on top of multiple BPM changes. The insanity and chaos found in the source material is neatly packaged and compressed, yet still provides enough to keep you hungry for more. Take a gamble and check one of these difficulties out, whatever you land on will not disappoint.

220 BPM, 6:34 | 6.85★

Simply by eyeing the name goreshit, most players will have a good idea of the 220 BPM stamina map to come.

In the 6-minute runtime *i love you more each time you die* plays for, there's the challenge of bursts, tech, slider flow, and the occasional stream—nothing within this map will ever let you off easy. This map stands as a constant stamina check to even those who excel in the field.

Even those not strong in the speed or stamina skillsets should still check it out—130 favourites already peg it as a clear crowd pleasure that you'll likely not regret... though your hand might be another story entirely.

175 BPM, 3:54 | 5.76★

Made in early 2017, *lapix - Morning Glow (feat. kradness)* has gathered over 130 favourites over the last 4 years, performing well in accessibility to the normally more difficult stream tech niche.

Sitting at high 5 stars and a comfortable 175 BPM, this map provides a fun alternative to flow aim with cleverly cut and spaced streams, buzz sliders, and finally slight applications of slider tech throughout, managing to cater to a large variety of techniques all at the same time. Whether it be for the map or the upbeat EDM, give this one a shot.

175 BPM, 5:12 | 6.64★

An absolutely killer collab between \_MiaoFUuU\_ and EijiKuinbii, this 175 BPM mid-6-star is anything but what it appears on the surface.

With a slow start and ponderous entrance into the main focus of the map, the higher velocity sliders, cut streams into doubles, and even the spaced triples all pose a daunting challenge—doubly so during kiai time. High flow aim control is all but required with the constant back-to-back patterning you will be hit by in this map, creating a challenging experience that makes every second of breathing room you can scrape back count.

*description written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

Gimmick maps are a niche that we don't really cover a lot nowadays but had such a big following back in the day, so we're glad to bring *leroy - ricky bobby* to this TWC-focused round!

This map has difficult-to-read SV changes that make it quite frightening at first glance, but mild enough that you can still learn its gimmick on a try or two. With practice it's possible to make a really impressive score. Although, having good reading skills or excellent pattern memorization won't get you this so easily, as it still requires you to be pretty good at stamina and high speed stream reading. Have fun!

122.5 BPM, 3:13 | 5.30★\
*description written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

Being one of the very few maps with a 100% pick rate during TWC, *phonon - polyriddim* is by far one of the most popular TWC picks and probably one of the most satisfying to see players clash on.

With completely unnerving patterns that follow a disconcerting rhythm, GNKait manages to accurately represent the absolute entropy this song implies, forcing players to navigate meticulously through all these notes and acing them one-by-one to avoid either hitting notes out of time or tripping and missing a bunch of notes.

If you're a fan of mid-BPM tech maps or otherwise reading-focused maps (or you really are into nested tuplets and all of their complexities), then this is with no doubt the perfect beatmap for you!

Do you want to be able to play stream maps well? This map is for you. Of course, those who are confident in their skills will also find this map challenging. This map is a stream map, and you will see complex and lengthy placements throughout. However, there are many different patterns, so you can enjoy the game until the end.

If you are not good at this kind of stream map, this is a good opportunity to overcome it. And if you're good at it, try this map to get a good record. Have fun!

We can't deny that this was one of the most popular beatmaps among the entire TWC pool. *Dz'Xa - 8284-TM* mapped by uone was selected for the TWC 2021 Quarter Finals and also as the Japanese team qualifier.

Dz'Xa is a rising musician in osu!taiko mapping scene, and he is also a taiko player himself! His unique style of music with unconventional beat snappings creates great synergy with taiko mapping. uone expressed the song's polyrhythmic theme and concept very accurately, ultimately making its way to the TWC's mappool. This beatmap will be an exciting challenge for you, so give it a shot!

*description written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

Rahatt has had a few appearances here in the Loved section already, and we're glad they're back with *Matusa Bomber*, a very fast-paced Gypsycore (as Rahatt likes to call it, meaning a breakcore song with a Balkan sound for its unique flavor) song clocking at 220 BPM.

That tempo might not seem like a lot to the most experienced taiko players, but it sure is when you factor in how nananass maps it! As per usual, the "nass style" involves a flurry of 1/6 patterns, mixed 1/8+1/6 patterns, 1/12 snapped 1/6 quadruplets and a lot of burst patterns that might be incredibly hard to hit no matter how good you are, which will require a TON of speed and reading capabilities to get a good score. Good luck!

*description written by [Wesley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2407265)*

This month we are going back in time once again—all the way back to 2011, when the difficulty "Original ver 2011" was created. ZHSteven, being one of the pioneers of osu!catch mapping, is not a newcomer to the Loved category with this being potentially their *7th* Loved map.

If you have played any of their maps before, you already know you are in for a bumpy ride. Showcasing its 2011 creation date, the map contains a lot of patterns that you might not see in the maps you see nowadays: namely "low" ar, tight movement pretty much everywhere and the dreaded stairs.

The "Dark killer" difficulty might only be 5.43 stars, but do not let that throw you off by any means. With the approach rate of 8.6 and all the patterns mentioned before, combined with everything else, this map is no walk in the park.

If you are a fan of maps that give you a run for your money, you should 100% give this map a spin and see how much of a challenge this will end up being for you!

A brand new face to Loved, Seija has been mapping for quite a while now, and is rapidly making a name for himself with his two other ranked maps. *Paradoxy* is pulled straight from his graveyard, showcasing a lot of similarity with his most popular ranked map, [Hypnotize](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/901704).

There are no crazy out-of-this-world gimmicks to be seen here—just a very solidly mapped difficulty, with an absolute banger track to support it. Players at the mid/high skill level should be able to play this quite well, and people from the higher/highest skill level echelons should be able to have a lot of fun with added mods.

So go check this out, see if you enjoy it, and vote yes if you do (this procedure is not quite as charmingly paradoxical as the map itself, but what can you do eh?)!

Already well known for his proficiency at crazy stamina and technical maps, fuhie also moonlights as a mapper when the mood strikes him, as shown with his set for *Hixxy - More and More (MCing in Tesco Cover)*.

Wiggles and bursts feature heavily in this map in a serious test of stamina and consistency, interwoven with a few interesting gimmicks like long vertical sliders mixed with spinners for that extra bit of spice. If you're one of those top players who are always seeking more challenging maps, you should try out this one!

This month I present you *Insane Techniques*, a collaboration between Minato Yukina and Ascendance, two of the biggest names of osu!catch mapping.

Abandoned shortly after its creation, this overlooked set reflects the mapping pedigree of its two creators, sporting a clean design and good through all throughout, focusing primary on consistency with stream patterns dotted with the occasional wiggle or hyperchain. While the first half is not all that difficult, the second half hits hard and fast and is sure to be a challenge. I think the map spent time in graveyard for way too long already and it is time to give it some love!

Their charting style tends to be very approachable and comfortable for players of all kinds, which has been a big contributor to the immense popularity of most of their sets. *Colorful* here is no exception, being a straightforward chordjack map with some breaks strung throughout. The ending can be a bit tricky however, especially on higher rates, lasting more than 30 seconds and being loaded with quad transitions.

Used in MWC 2020 and countless other tournaments, Chrubble's *Dysnomia* is a staple boss chart for the tournament protagonist seeking an adventurous challenge.

Sitting at a whopping 4 minutes, this map persists in its continued intensity and technicality throughout, giving players a massive and formidable challenge. It's no surprise that this map has been used so often in the tournament scene. Its popularity in this regard has garnered the map a spot in Loved voting, and we hope you enjoy this map and give it a vote!

Mipha-'s *Battle Against a True Hero* is here to show who the strongest players truly are!

This mapset includes two very different difficulties, each with their own respective rates. The "Challenge" difficulty offers some clean rice patterns that test players' ability to stay patient with lots of short breaks between the relatively comfortable patterns, weaving in heavy hand sections during the final portion that are sure to live up to the difficulty's name.

With the "Howling" difficulty, the charting takes a turn and becomes full LN, testing the limits of your release accuracy at OD8 and gradually expanding in the last half to a flurry of hands in the same full LN, really putting your reading skills to the test.

Tidek is back with *saihate*, an extraordinarily difficult hybrid that has just about everything you can ask for—jacks, inverses, streams, and bursts persisting throughout the map.

Featured in multiple tournaments including MWC 2020, this map has become increasingly popular and for good reason—it constantly provides the player with a significant challenge. And if the default rate wasn't a challenge enough, this mapset includes rate-ups to 1.15x, which provides even greater of a challenge for those who are up for it.

Because of its quality and popularity, *saihate* pretty clearly deserves a spot in the Loved section, so we hope you'll show the map some support by voting!

AWMRone's *INNOCENCE* set is here to give some representation to all key counts. This set includes six other collaborators who helped this variety happen, and all of them took some different approaches to how they mapped the song.

The 5K, 6K, 7K, and MisterLuka's 4K difficulty all take a long-note-oriented approach, as well as vary in the level of difficulty that they test. The 8K, 9K, 10K, and AWMRone's 4K all have more of a focus put onto the rice dynamics of the chart and also vary greatly in density from each other.

It's always cool to see mappers come together and collaborate on something like this in order to all provide something different for a variety of players. Give your vote to show support for what AWMRone helped put together here!

Such an extremely well-made technical hybrid chart can only be made by the talented tournament mapper Gekido- (lemonguy).

This chart was first introduced for the MWC 7K 2019 Finals mappool to challenge the finalists for their precise control in maintaining consistency, stamina, dense rice, and confusing LN. There are zero mental breaks in regards to maintaining a good score; throughout the song, you're challenged with 240 BPM chordstreams and diversifying trills with technical LN transitions. Even when the song shifts to lower density, you're yet again challenged with light tech LN releases and single trills that may come with unexpected chokes for those not paying attention...

Over the 2 years, this map has been seen as a genuine pick for players to add to their practice collections and hone their skills for future tournament use, as this chart pays close attention to similarly charted finalist mappools. To continue that challenging aspect, and raise the stakes for the competitive scene, give your vote to support this chart to go further within the player base!

[Camellia - Panic Toy World: Isoide! Omocha no Athletics](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/857251#mania) by [Kim_GodSSI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2218047)\

The well-known mapper and player Kim_GodSSI released this beautifully symmetrical chart in 2018 and has since been known across the 7K community to be a perfect map to getting started in the BMS skillset.

This is 4 minutes of differentiated rice patterning for any 7K BMS players' dreams. Featured within is consistent, bouncy chordstream/jacking along with technical dump, becoming more dense within the vocal sessions of the song. The chart is definitely no breezefly of a task, as although the patterning is easy to read, it's 4 minutes of constant pressure to maintain consistency, which can definitely be nerve racking to full combo.

With the song being such a joy to listen to, pairing the fun and bouncy structure along with it, this map is definitely a way to start your day! Give it your support by voting for this joyous chart!
