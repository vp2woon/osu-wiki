The 20th cycle of the Community Mentorship program is upon us! With this new cycle, you can learn just about anything besides rocket science, which is admittedly easier sometimes.

For those with a more visual or programming leaning to their interests, you may be pleased to know we've finally added Storyboarding as a section to the Mentorship program!

As for those keen to help out mappers in polishing and improving their maps, we will be inaugurating a Modding section as well.

If you've ever found yourself wanting to expand your current knowledge and skills or help beginner mappers get started, the regular Mapping-oriented program will serve as a great opportunity for you!

The Community Mentorship program serves as a place for upcoming mappers, modders, and storyboarders, to develop their skills under the guidance of more experienced members in the community.

Over the course of a cycle, you'll have the opportunity to learn from your mentor, participate in various mentorship events (like mapping contests), hang out with fellow mentees, and more!

If you're experienced in mapping, modding, or storyboarding, and have a desire to take those who are new under your wing, then give joining us as Mentor a shot! In the [forum announcement and rule thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1472007), you'll be able to apply right away. If you're only just getting into mapping, modding, or storyboarding, or are eager to hone your skills, then signing up as Mentee might just be your way to do it!
