You made your voices heard, and we now have both the Community's Favourite and the Mapper's Favourite of 2020 for each game mode! Check it out!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/116/cc2020_osu.jpg)

For those who might've missed the voting, the Community Choice polls are a yearly continuation of osu!'s fabled "best of" tradition, where everybody has their say in a giant mega poll to determine the most popular map of that particular year.

This year, we've decided to do something a little bit new and added an extra special category for each mode titled the Mapper's Favourite, which represents exactly what it says - the mapping community's pick for that year.

To have had your vote count towards this new category, you must have ranked at least one map throughout osu!'s decade-plus history (ranking any guest difficulties doesn't count). If you don't meet this criterion, your vote is still counted towards the Community Favourite like everybody else's, never fear.

As an extra note, you may be surprised just how few mappers there really are in comparison to the full-community voting numbers, and especially in the smaller game-modes. This is perfectly normal because getting a map ranked is an often complicated and lengthy process that few people really undertake to its conclusion. It does, however, mean that the voting will be a *lot* closer in those modes, as... well, you'll see.

Now, with that out of the way, onwards to this year's winners:

### osu!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-02-05-community-choice-2020-results/daddy-daddy-do.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1147361)

Crowned as the Community Favourite of 2020 for osu! is [hypercyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9155377)'s set for [**DADDY ! DADDY ! DO ! feat. Suzuki Airi (TV Size)**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1147361) with a whopping **1293** votes, nearly *400* more than the nearest competitor!

Sometimes we like to say "the voting was close" but in this case, it *really* wasn't - hypercyte and his comrades have done an outstanding job creating an indisputably popular set that turned some serious heads, a doubly impressive feat given that it was ranked as far back as April. Keeping people's attention for the better part of a year when over 10 maps are entering the game every day is no small feat!

Finalists:

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-02-05-community-choice-2020-results/space-angel.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1238432)

Taking the top spot as our first ever Mapper's Favourite with **74** votes is the one and only stonking mega-collab masterpiece that is [**False Noise - Space Angel**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1238432), hosted by [**MaestroSplinter**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6707918)!

A crowd favourite originally featured in the [osu! Beatmapping World Championship 2020](/wiki/Contests/oBWC/2) from Team Argentina, Space Angel has been described by commentators as:

- "an aspire map but it's rankable 😳😳" - [MataSid](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9530468)
- "Argentina went to space and came back with an angel" - [Nozhomi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2716981)
- "This map is like a museum — a place devoted to display of objects of lasting interest." - [Saxarok](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9619716)

Reflected in the mappers-only voting by a significant margin, Space Angel clearly ended up as a religious experience for the mapping community, and very much deserves its spot at the very top.

Due to the extremely collaborative nature of this set, we've also decided to make a one-off exception to our rule where only the host of the set typically receives the badge and prize, and have instead awarded it to all **12** mappers involved.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-02-05-community-choice-2020-results/excuse-my-rudeness.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1278695)

Pairing dons and kats with the twin talents of two stupendously potent producers (one of whom happens to be a Virtual YouTuber), [**Calliope Mori - Excuse My Rudeness, but Could You Please RIP?<3 (t+pazolite Remix)**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1278695) hosted by [**Capu**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2474015) soared to snag the Community Favourite spot in osu!taiko for 2020 with **127** votes total.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-02-05-community-choice-2020-results/super-ink-burst.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1182264)

Titled by its creator as a "high effort map", [**Iglooghost - Super Ink Burst**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1182264) very much lived up to [**Ulqui**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1263669)'s intent with a considerable **36** vote total, earning the unique honour of becoming the titular Mapper's Favourite of 2020.

Finalists:

## osu!catch

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-02-05-community-choice-2020-results/finorza.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1151836)

Dethroning Lord Fruitbowl (also known as Ascendance) for the first time since the Community Choice contests have taken place under their new name (which is basically four years running now), [**Rocma**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276) officially authored the Community Favourite of 2020 for osu!catch with [Camellia feat. Nanahira - finorza](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1151836), scoring **109** votes.

This is very fitting for Rocma, who went from being considered as the "most promising newcomer" in 2018's Mapper's Choice Awards only to rather explosively prove himself in 2020 proper, showcasing that even the highest-fiber titan can be eventually toppled by the choice arrangement of your favourite fruits performed by a skilled hand. It did, however, remain very close in votes well up to closing time.

If the comments for this map are anything to go off, it is a choice arrangement indeed!

Finalists:

- [**Kaneko Chiharu - iLLness LiLin**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/777109) by [**Ascendance**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) with **99** votes.

You may be wondering why there are three banners up there. This must be a mistake, surely.

Nope. It happened.

The Mapper's Favourite of 2020 for osu!catch is an established **three-way tie** with [**Kaneko Chiharu - iLLness LiLin**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/777109) by [**Ascendance**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883), [**lapix - Carry Me Away**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1018810) by [**Minato Yukina**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/531253) and [**Camellia feat. Nanahira - finorza**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1151836) by [**Rocma**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276) all scoring exactly **17** votes total.

We do say sometimes (read: always) that every vote counts, and nothing makes it quite as obvious as this kind of outcome does. Needless to say, we certainly didn't expect *this*.

In the spirit of applauding a job well done, all three of the mappers mentioned above will earn themselves the reward in full, including the badge.

Oh, and Rocma won *twice*, just in case it wasn't apparent. You should probably check out that beatmap, damn. Lord Fruitbowl (Ascendance) claims his fifth sort-of-consecutive victory as well, blessed be the high-fiber throne. osu!catch certainly gets up to some shenanigans, those lovable rascals.

Finalists:

## osu!mania

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-02-05-community-choice-2020-results/genre-switches.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1034114)

Shamelessly petitioning on Twitter for support, [**Hydria**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/808176)'s pleas did not fall on deaf ears as it turns out that people do indeed actually like his set for [**Camellia - We Could Get More Machinegun Psystyle! (And More Genre Switches)**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1034114) rather a lot, scoring a whopping **226** votes total... and winning the Community Favourite by exactly **one** vote.

Now, as he has [so kindly promised](https://twitter.com/wHydria/status/1352210593156116481), the single deciding vote earned means that he must create another 7* map during 2021 or else be condemned for all eternity to roam along with the other forsaken people on this planet who say one thing on the internet and then do something else instead.

Granted, it is unlikely to be a difficult feat for him given his considerable mapping pedigree, so look forward to it! And spare a moment of silence for poor [IceDynamix](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8599070), whose beatmap fell short by the thinnest margin we have ever had in osu!mania. On any vote. Across all the contests we've ever held. Goodness.

Finalists:

- [**HyuN - Grin**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/923488) by [**IceDynamix**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8599070) with **225** votes.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-02-05-community-choice-2020-results/run.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1025170)

Scoring a well-earned spot as the Mapper's Favourite of 2020, [**Blocko**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092)'s set for [**Frums - We Want To Run**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1025170) sprinted into **28** votes like nobody's business.

Given that it is a full 7K beatmap in a mode predominately occupied by 4K players, this makes it only all the more impressive. Noting that it is also a full spread catering to a huge, nuanced tiering of difficulty within osu!mania itself, it is easy to see where the admiration from the mapping scene might've come from. That and Blocko is something of a household name when it comes to these things.

An honourable mention goes to [**Abraxos**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5025064), who tied himself for second twice with two different creations. If that's not talent, we don't know what is.

Finalists:

And with that, Community Choice 2020 is done and dusted!

What a year 2020 was, and we're at least satisfied that the crazy voting in the new Mapper's Favourite category has fit the bill perfectly.
