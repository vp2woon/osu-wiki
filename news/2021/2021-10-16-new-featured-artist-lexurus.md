**Lexurus** climbs the ranks as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/208/header.jpg)

Residing in the liquid drum & bass paradise (otherwise known as the Netherlands), EDM producer **Lexurus** has been mastering his craft for the better half of a decade. Some of you might recognize his works from [High Tea Music](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/26), one of our first Featured Artist label collections, or more recently through his countless releases under major drum & bass label *Liquicity*.

We rounded up **11** relaxing yet captivating tracks for you to slap some beatmaps onto, all available from [**Lexurus**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/208)!

**Lexurus**'s sound is familiar to anyone who keeps an eye on osu!'s drum & bass scene. If you're not in the loop however, you're lucky — you can indulge in the ephemeral feeling of listening to **Lexurus** for the first time. See what that's like through drum & bass aficionado [Strategas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2971837)'s newest beatmap in this video, then check out the other previews below!
