More songs are available for mapping on [**Sewerslvt**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/169). Unfortunately we couldn't pick up some heavily sampled songs for legal reasons. We grabbed a bunch of other cool songs at least.

...

And, uh.

*ahem*

That's all for now!

We'll be back next week to introduce two more immensely talented artists. Wednesday's announcement features a metal act that's far beyond overdue, so stay tuned for that and keep an eye on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) for everything else our circle-clicking hub has on display!

See you then!
