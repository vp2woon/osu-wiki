With a fresh batch of maps from the grave, [Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) returns with your monthly dose of maps to vote on!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)

For those unfamiliar, Project Loved hosts monthly votes to decide which nominated maps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). You can click on each of the map's banners in this post to go to its poll on the forums. More info is on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved)!

This month we do not have any new announcements regarding any changes just yet but you never know! As always we're actively listening to community feedback in order to make the Loved section better, so if you ever have any suggestions, have a browse at the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) on ways to leave your feedback!

With that out of the way, let's move onto the maps!

[RoughSketch - 666](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1171250#osu) by [Lebros](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12511947)\
333 BPM, 1:58 | 4.68★, 5.34★, 6.66★, 8.58★

This song is exactly what it says on the tin - 666 BPM Speedcore. The mapping? Well, that reflects that fact. High spacing on flow aim and jumps make this a challenge to even keep up with in terms of speed, and in line with the speedcore genre there are occasional buzz sliders here and there between the wiggles and rhythm changes to keep you on your toes.

If you're looking for fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled fun, then look no further.

[xi - Freedom Dive (tpz Overcute Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/895846#osu) by [Twiggykun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9126943)\
234.55 BPM, 3:01 | 8.03★

More Freedom Dive can never hurt, right? Especially not when it's been remixed by t+pazolite!

The song changes almost entirely but still features its recognisable melody to keep everything moving, meaning the map is going to seem a bit different also; Instead of all the winding deathstreams, in their place lie 8\* jumps that never slow down, and even then there's still a spaced stream or two at a slightly increased 234.55 BPM.

If you've never heard this remix before you owe it to yourself to give it at least one listen, and maybe while you're there you can give the map a try too - that is, if you think your aim hand is up to the task!

180 BPM, 2:09 | 2.13★, 5.82★, 6.47★

The star rating says 5.82\*, but don't let that one fool you - this one is a real challenge. Many different rhythmic ideas are featured in this song, and the map definitely captures all of them in good fashion, not letting any high spacing overwhelm the complexity of the song, and if you know EBIMAYO then you'll know this song is top notch.

Also, a modern remap has been added if you're looking for something a bit more liberal on difficulty but with the same tapping intensity. This one is a real joy to play, come and test yourself against the ever-changing rhythms and light technicality this map has to offer, you're not likely to regret it!

[ayaponzu\* - Justice Monster](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1026767#osu) by [Settia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2445897)\
160 BPM, 4:13 | 6.17★, 7.07★

If you've watched or played in any high end tournaments, you'll know this map well by now, but for those who haven't you're in for a trial.

160 BPM and yet still 7\* should already be a warning sign, but get into the map and you'll be faced with unrelenting spaced streams and even a few technical patterns scattered across the four-minute run time.

There's an Extra difficulty that changes the circle size from 4 to 2 if you want less of an aim challenge, but the circles still don't touch in most streams - all of this coupled with a eurobeat banger no less. The map is a treat to play, so come give it a go!

[Unlucky Morpheus - Angreifer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/581468#osu) by [Scarsnic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2736673)\
220 BPM, 6:58 | 7.13★

Scarsnic has been one of the more well known "graveyard mappers" for years, throwing out many great high difficulty maps to challenge players and push boundaries, and this one is no exception.

Hailing from before the ranked set of this song, it features many of the same aspects such as challenging streams and high spacing jumps, all neatly arranged together into a 7 minute marathon that will test the high end consistency of any player. Do you have what it takes to face this map's challenge head-on?

[virkato - Waltz in G Minor No.17 "Valse du grand chien"](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/116778#osu) by [CuNha](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/521116)\
300 BPM, 2:10 | 6.25★

Released in 2013 and consisting of technical rhythm and aim at a scarily hard difficulty for the time, *Valse du grand chien* has always been one of *those* maps - the ones that only the true best of the best can play, so far off-the-beaten-path that it is barely ever touched on.

Now, in 2021, players have finally caught up to the skill this bit of ancient history requires - and since the mapping still holds up brilliantly, it is finally time for this lost gem to rise from the grave and see if it can still challenge the top players of today.

175 BPM, 4:25 | 3.94★, 5.76★

We have to ask ourselves this: is osu! ready for Gold Dust 2?

[The original](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/28107#osu/93842) passed the 10 year anniversary of it's upload on the 28th March this year, and this one was uploaded almost a year and a half later - filled with galvenize's iconic symmetry and awkward aim patterns on a smooth remix of the original song.

This map is going to be a thorough challenge for even the best but fear not, as just like on the original set there is another \~4\* collab difficulty by galvenize and kriers to test the mettle of up-and-coming players if you're not up to the main difficulty just quite yet.

Personally? I think we are finally ready.

275 BPM, 4:00 | 1.91★, 2.26★, 3.75★, 5.47★, 6.81★

After a short push for ranked in early 2013, this set sadly fell by the wayside, which is a shame since if it was ranked I believe it would have been one of the "boss maps" of its time.

Featuring 275 BPM streams and fast aim patterns, it's a real step above the general difficulty of the era's usual mapping, and still holds up really well today, so go give it a try and see what one of the forgotten challenges of the era looks like. There's a full spread of difficulties too, so there's really something for every player in this mapset.

202 BPM, 4:17 | 2.00★ – 8.81★

You've seen high star rating jump maps, yes. You may also have seen high star rating maps with a mix of both jumps and streams, but have you ever seen a map this hard full of purely stream aim?

*over the top* wastes no time in trying to make you fail, and ramps up to a mighty 8.8\* at the end, really taking the song's name literally. It has little in the way of jump aim to contend with too - this one is a pure push on your flow aim. The set has a full array of difficulties, so if you're not ready to tackle the final boss you can always step down and contend with one of the mid-bosses along the way.

All-in-all, it is a real fun time, so go give it a go and see if you can work your way up to the top!

*description written by [POCARI SWEAT](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5082685)*

Chill J-Pop music is beloved by many, and several taiko players like speedy patterns. So how about combining those two? *Shoujo Rei* mapped by kitafuma is a beatmap which is an outstanding result of this exotic attempt.

A departure from harsh breakcore assailing your ears, this song's relaxing vibes strike a curious contrast with its double BPM patterns, creating an exciting challenge. The use of various snap divisors will give you an immersive experience you might expect in more traditional breakcore maps, but neatly wrapped up in a J-Pop package.

If you're not quite ready for the challenge, there's also an easier Oni diff containing the full song with much more forgiving patterns that we strongly recommend you check out.

It's not very often that we manage to bring full sets to the Loved Section, let alone one that is over 4 minutes long, but we think *Clover Kakume-tion* is well worth your consideration.

As a Japanese set consisting of 8 difficulties mapped at double BPM (290 BPM),
the lower end might strike a challenge that demands a skill set not often encountered by newer players, but something that we think is a very welcome addition to Loved.

On the other side of things, yassu-'s diff *DJ MOKOJI* works as a heavy stamina speed map that could easily be a difficult challenge to most of the aliens in the osu!taiko community!

I don't think -Ken needs an introduction in the osu!catch scene as a mapper, providing many maps for you to enjoy whether you're new or not.

Just listening to the song should give you a rough idea of what the map has to offer. Both the song and map start off quite calm and as the song builds up, it starts to introduce new elements to the table. Zigzags, streams, some sliders here and there that are hard to get accuracy on, the map has it all!

Between the slower parts in the kiai and the faster paced moments, the map is very well balanced with no spikes in difficulty at all, and paced to be just long enough to be a serious test of your skill.

Don't you sometimes feel like you just want to become one with the cherry blossoms, its calmness and its beauty? Then sadly, I can't really help you, but I can provide you this awesome mapset that goes by the same name! Here we have Spectator returning to the Loved section with a nice lil' collaborated set of his!

There aren't any crazy gimmicks to be had here. I mean, this map was even used in CWC 2017. It is just a well-made set, being neither on the extreme end of jumpiness or streaminess and accessible by pretty much everybody on the skill spectrum while having a nice, upbeat song. Higher-end players will definitely enjoy themselves playing this with several variations of mods enabled, to crank up the difficulty to a notch more challenging for them.

So sit back and relax, maybe pretend that you did become one with the cherry blossoms after all, and check this out!

Finally a new name that enters the Loved section! Just kidding, it's ExGon, and yet another old gem of his, this time with *The Prince of Darkness*.

The MixGon diff was created as early as 2012, whereas the other diff was created in 2015. The difficulties themselves are, as expected of older mapping, quite gimmicky and you would rarely see similar stuff being done in this day and age. The use of CS5 on both the diffs further intensifies this 'old map feeling'.

If you are not consistent enough at older mapping styles you will likely have trouble to do well on the map, especially because the difficulty is quite high. But the map itself is really fun and challenging to play, so I would definitely recommend to give it a try!

Being nominated as a No Mod pick in osu!catch World Cup 2020 Round of 16, this map was a popular pick during the tournament. The higher BPM has allowed many players to enjoy the map, especially the BPM shift in the middle of the song is one of the map's most prominent things to enjoy.

Jemzuu is well-known for his technical yet clean mapping style, and I'd say this one is more close to his 'classical' style, focusing more on good flow and playability. If you like his maps you shouldn't miss this one out!

We're starting off this Loved wave in April with a classic Shoegazer chart, *Epidermis*!

Overall, this chart is incredibly technical, emulating the excitement and intensity of the percussive break samples. The map is enjoyable the whole way through, even in the somewhat calmer sections, and players are constantly kept on their toes up until the ending, where the most brutal patterns in the drum solo come into play.

The chart has been featured in many tournaments including the osu!mania World Cup 2019, and it's no surprise that it's become so popular given how erratic and thrilling it is. We hope you enjoy seeing this map in the Loved section!

*MTC* is here! This long-standing set has been actively played by the osu!mania community for 7 years now, and is finally making its way into the Loved section.

Back in 2014 when this was uploaded the mania community was still fresh and new, and it's sets like these that players from that era can look on and remember fondly. Combinatorix, aka "Quick Draw", provided numerous maps during this time that gave players of all kinds things that they could practice. For *MTC's* case, all 4 of the 4K difficulties here provide some very friendly patterns to anybody who is just getting into mania or VSRG in general.

It's because of this sets history, and the significance of things like it that the Loved team is always happy to bring them here for everybody to enjoy again. Cast your vote to show the love!

The higher difficulty 4K here is more stream-oriented, while the 7K takes on some O2Jam-style patterning, but both sides present good challenges to players looking to test their LN accuracies.

Everything here is tied together by the song's comfortable 140 BPM, which lends itself to the creative and fun patterning that LostCool has to offer. This set truly is a crowd favourite, and definitely deserves to be nominated for Loved.

We finally have a chart from Remuring for the loved section! *Karma* is designed for 7K players who both love their long notes, along with maps that are layered comfortably and tastefully.

Both the map and song here are relatively new, but that didn't stop this map from skyrocketing in popularity due to its quality. As for Remuring, they have been actively mapping for several years at this point, going through a number of style changes during that time, which helped define their now distinctive style of mapping. This map is also a collaborative effort between Remuring, and another prolific mapper from the mania scene, ruka.

Together, they present a long note map that is equal parts challenging and fun, and we hope you all agree!

[lapix - Carry Me Away (Extended Mix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1135854#mania) by [Evening](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2193881)\
175 BPM, 3:57 | 7.11★, 7.11★\

A crowd favorite, Evening finally makes a comeback for this round with a major bop of a track and a hard banger of a chart.

At 175 BPM, the map makes good use of dense chord-streaming paired with occasional heavy LN usages of varying lengths and intensities; expect some bursts as well! The map overall has a very flashy visual flair serving as an amalgamation of many note-charting styles with it's usage of symmetry, laning, and repetition which is contrasted by the heavy variations in LN usage and chord-streaming.

If you're into something a little extra, the Airbound (Evening's Flip) difficulty has an abundance of SVs thrown into the mix heavily characterized by very strong bumps with a fair mix of teleports, slowjams, and granular speed changes, and even some fastjams.

Don't let those scare you though as these add up to the experience and a generally sight-readable one too. So what are you waiting for? Give this a shot and be prepared to get carried away!
