Welcome **Michael Cera Palin** to the ever-growing Featured Artist lineup!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/182/header.jpg)

Shifting from the usual electronic rhythm game-y sound, **Michael Cera Palin** is an American three-piece indie rock band with an insanely catchy and emotional sound. The group set sail in 2015 and has since released two EPs, each with songs featuring a blend of rhythmic complexity and high energy that's perfect for an osu! mapper's needs.

We picked up **9** stunning tracks for [**Michael Cera Palin**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/182) (which is every original song they've released!).

Beatmapper [Hobbes2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8157492) introduced **Michael Cera Palin** to the osu! scene, so it's only fitting to introduce you to the band's sound through Hobbes2's beatmap of [*Portrait of a Woman on a Couch With Cats*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1275141)!

All of the above plus a few more can be found on [**Michael Cera Palin**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/182). Did you know the band's name is called a "portmanteau"? If not, it sounds like you should read the blurb on their listing... and maybe choose a song to map while you're there.

That's all for now! We hope your earballs are enjoying every song we throw your way, and make sure your eyedrums are glued to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for more!

See you next week!
