### Mapper for custom TWC maps

Following the widespread positive reception of custom mapping in OWC 2020, we've decided to take a page out of their playbook and incorporate it into TWC 2021!

Mappers of the osu!taiko gamemode will now have a way to express their interest in mapping exclusively for the TWC!

Required availability is from now until around the end of March - further details can be found on the application form.

[Apply here](https://forms.gle/6bHCRSR3LDxo7Acf8) if you are interested in helping out!

### Commentator/Referee

Commentators and referees aim to provide a great live viewing experience.

We are currently looking for experienced commentators for the osu!taiko gamemode. This would require you to be available on weekends from early March to mid April!

[Apply here](https://forms.gle/XcpXMrYtGDZHVcmQ7) if you are interested in helping out either as a referee or a commentator!
