Dive into the bass-filled tunes of **Getty**, our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/128/header.jpg)

Guaranteed to get your heart pumping to at minimum 170BPM, [**Getty**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/128) is a Tokyo-based DJ and producer whose talent is widely known throughout both the Japanese club and rhythm-game scenes.

Given his involvement in the massive label *HARDCORE TANO\*C* and his countless appearances in games like *beatmania IIDX*, *WACCA*, and *SOUND VOLTEX*, we're proud to have his talent available to osu! players as well!

A solid **19** track catalog is available spanning **Getty**'s 2 major albums, including a chunky bunch of tracks in collaboration with *DJ DiA*, including the ever-popular song *Grayed Out -Antifront-*.

And who's better to demonstrate the pure intensity of **Getty**'s music other than slider spamming legend [Realazy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/918297), whose map of [*Engage-Rex-*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1336197) perfectly shows what we've got on the table. See how 9 different players manage (at the same time):

I imagine you're ready to start mapping by now, so head over to [**Getty**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/128) to hear even more and download your very own pre-timed beatmap templates. Please, Realazy is starving for competition at this point.

Itching for more Featured Artists? We've got one more coming Saturday, another Wednesday, then yet another the next Saturday, and... maybe keeping tabs on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) would be a better way to handle this.

Until then!
