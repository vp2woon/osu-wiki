**Irreversible Mechanism** crashes into the Featured Artist roster!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/135/header.jpg)

Holding true to their name, progressive death metal titan **Irreversible Mechanism** has been unstoppable ever since its inception. Immediately following an independent release of their first album featuring heavy instrumentation and a touch of neo classical sounds, the band was signed by the metal label *Blood Music*, through which they've since released their second album to even further success.

We've secured **14** songs from both of the band's records, mappers are free to venture and immerse themselves in the world created by **Irreversible Mechanism**.

"What can I expect from these maps", you ask? We asked a few players around rank #50,000 to demo a section of [Into the Void](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/454451) mapped by [Mazzerin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2942381) to give you a quick taste (plus some previews of other songs):

Don't forget what really matters here — everything above and more is primed and ready for mapping over on [**Irreversible Mechanism**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/135), pre-timed beatmap templates included! And don't worry, we'll be releasing *osu!arthritis medicine* 30 years from now to account for the damage inflicted by these beatmaps.

That's all for this week! Check out the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for info on our upcoming Featured Artists and whatever else is relevant to our circle-clicking colony.

See you next Wednesday!
