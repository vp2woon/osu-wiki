We're proud to introduce our latest Featured Artists **Fred V & Grafix**!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/180/header.jpg)

Drum & bass innovators **Fred V & Grafix** are a duo best known for diversity within their genre. Drawing influence from sources outside the scope of usual drum & bass like funk, soul, rock, and jazz, their music introduces and masters styles that few other producers in their scene have even attempted to wrangle.

We picked up **7** tracks from their catalogue featuring a wide selection of guest vocalists, all of which are up for grabs from [**Fred V & Grafix**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/180)!

While the ephemeral duo split in 2018 so each producer could pursue their own solo careers, the osu! community will continue to carry their legacy through a slew of awesome beatmaps. Check them out and maybe map some for yourself:
