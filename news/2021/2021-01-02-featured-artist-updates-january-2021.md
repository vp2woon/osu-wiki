We're keeping things simple: **click an artist's name or banner to visit their Featured Artist page.** All new songs are marked with a bright 'n' fancy *NEW* icon.

New songs are also listed below along with any relevant ranked maps. These should give you a quick impression of what's in store, but also remember that individual song previews are available from each Featured Artist page!

Got all that? Great. Let's go.

- [**Celldweller - Goodbye (Remixed by Klayton)**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1157287#osu/2415041) mapped by [Myahkey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6684556)
- **Celldweller - Retros**
- **Celldweller - The Wings of Icarus (feat. James Dooley)**
- **Celldweller - Birthright**
- **Celldweller - Shapeshifter (feat. Styles Of Beyond)**

We're starting out with **5** new tracks from the industrial rock/metal mastermind **Celldweller**. Ranging from fast paced drum and bass tracks to grand instrumental pieces, these new additions aim to fill some of the frequently requested holes in Celldweller's already-popular listing.

## [ELFENSJóN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/69)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/69/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/69)

Additions from their new album *STYX*:

- **ELFENSJóN - Okibi no Hate**
- **ELFENSJóN - LUNATIC MIRAGE**

**ELFENSJóN** has seen some of the fastest growth of any Featured Artist yet! Since their addition to the Featured Artist listing in 2020, [15 more of their songs have received ranked maps](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=elfensjon&sort=ranked_desc), making the addition of their newest album a no-brainer.

## [High Tea Music](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/26)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/26/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/26)

- **High Maintenance - My World (feat. Deuce & Charger)**

One of the oldest members of the FA roster is back again! We've got **7** new drum and bass tracks from **High Tea Music**, all of which have been shortened by their respective artists specifically for osu!. With lengths around 2 minutes or less, repetitive rhythms will be a concern of the past!

## [Magnetude](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/94)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/94/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/94)

- **[Magnetude - Signals](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/850972#osu/1891907)** mapped by [Firebool](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6182439)

James Peacock and Rustam Mansurov (a.k.a. the dude behind [Rusty K](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/87)) return under their **Magnetude** alias with a few of their most well-known tracks! *Signals* is a track we're especially happy to include — it's the first **Magnetude** track to have reached the ranked category with a huge number of plays to date.

## [MIMI](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/77)

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-01-02-featured-artist-updates-january-2021/MIMI-header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/77)

- **MIMI - Karabako ni Ai**
- **MIMI - Le Rouge**
- **MIMI - Soshite Yoruto Tomoru**
- **MIMI - Yoake Maeni Tobinotte**

Pop vocaloid extraordinaire **MIMI** is back with more! Their journey as a Featured Artist began strong thanks to maps like [Ai no Sukima](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/952409) and [Mizuoto to Curtain](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/968171) by [Log Off Now](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4378277), later branching out into a massive collection of ranked maps by all sorts of mappers! Clearly **MIMI**'s music has an impact on osu! players, so we're proud to bring more your way!

## [onumi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/32)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/32/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/32)

- **onumi - libido**
- **onumi - Melding Vines**
- **onumi - section 9**
- **onumi - spider tank**
- **Varien - One Shot One Kill (onumi remix)**

We're done playing it safe. These new tracks from **onumi** are miles away from the kind of sound you'd hear from our other Featured Artists, each being a masterpiece in its own distinct way. Words can't begin to explain what we mean, so like... just [preview the tracks for yourself](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/32).

## [Sennzai](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/110)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/110/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/110)

- **Yuichiro Tsukagoshi (NanosizeMir) feat. Sennzai - Hoshi Tan Ambivalence**
- **Yunosuke feat. Sennzai - SickCrazy**

She may have only joined our Featured Artists recently, but **Sennzai** has already released new music! These 3 collaborative tracks from her latest mini-album continue to raise the bar for what she has to offer, and we're sure mappers will come to love each one.
