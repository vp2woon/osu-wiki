osu! player and modern music pioneer **miraie** rolls in as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/162/header.jpg)

Those of us who grew up in the osu! neighbourhood may be more than familiar with **miraie** already. He runs a [half-million-subscriber YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB18IliCiBeraa8oysaTZSQ) where he produced countless osu!-related videos a few years back.

Recently **miraie** has been exploring new territory. He's taken a deep dive into music production (beyond his infamous [Gucci Gucci Literature Club bootleg mashup](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/723641)), most notably with success as a vocalist and producer in the *hyperpop* genre.

**17** of these new songs are available from [**miraie**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/162), all prepped for you to start mapping!

Ever wondered how an osu! player thinks about music? Wonder no more since we interviewed **miraie** the other day about exactly that. Check it out and preview some of his stellar tracks below:

Aiming to become one of osu!'s first hyperpop mappers? Head on down to [**miraie**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/162) and give mapping a stab with any of the pre-timed beatmap templates. We strongly recommend starting with the song *feelings* for reasons you can figure out for yourself.

Today's release is done and dusted, but if you're looking for more artists, we've got another scheduled for this upcoming Saturday! As per usual, news on that and whatever else we throw your way can be found on the  [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame).

See you later this week!
