**Redside** enters the stage as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/184/header.jpg)

A familiar name to those who followed [A Labour of Love](/wiki/Contests/A_Labour_of_Love_Contest) last year, **Redside** is the super talented musician behind the [community vote](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/115)'s winning entry [*My Love (Redside Remix) (feat. Hatsune Miku)*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1388993)! Sporting an electronic style that pulls from kawaii future bass and 8-bit VGM with sprinkles of jazz and old-school retro instrumentation, **Redside**'s distinct sound is one that'll attract mappers interested in the more relaxing side of beatmapping.

**6** tracks are available on [**Redside**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/184), including their *My Love* remix and 5 new originals!

For those who missed **Redside**'s showcase in A Labour of Love's results live stream, here's a quick sample of what the community loved:

Need more artists to pour your circles onto? We've got you covered. Next week's Featured Artist lineup will introduce another rhythm game producer and an artist from a not-so-conventional genre, so keep a finger on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) for all the upcoming details.

See you next Wednesday!
