Spreading his wings to soar into basically every rhythm game in existence, **siromaru** finally flies into our Featured Artist collection!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/226/header.jpg)

You might know **siromaru** from his collaboration with [Cranky](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/23) on [*conflict*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/936126) — a song that's practically become a staple for rhythm games these days. **siromaru**'s works dive deep into a lesser-known techno genre called "Schranz", leading his tunes to take on a form that can't be replicated by anyone else in the rhythm game realm.

From *SOUND VOLTEX* and *maimai* to *Arcaea* and now osu!, **siromaru** enters the Featured Artist library with **20** outstanding tracks, all available from [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/226)!

If you're looking for a sample of **siromaru**'s work (and you've already played through *conflict*), explore [Gensou Kaiki no Omochabako](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1649491) through its unconventional slidershapes in the video below, then hop into any of the other awesome songs that are up for grabs:
