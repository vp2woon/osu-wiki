Grace your eardrums with music by **linear ring** — our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/213/header.jpg)

Aiming to emotionally move listeners with each note, **linear ring** is the mind behind an ever-growing collection of future bass and electro house tunes. Along with visual designer *mozuya*, he first stepped into the rhythm game spotlight through the song *enchanted love* in  BOFXVI, later making its way to *Arcaea* (and now osu!).

**9** tracks are ready for your mapper jaws to chew on, all available from [**linear ring**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/213)!

**linear ring**'s first appearance on osu! coincidentally also came through a beatmap of [*enchanted love*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1403832) hosted by [\[Hatsune Miku\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3045895). Experience that in all its ring-like glory with the 360 degree video below, then check out the rest of his outstanding songs!
