**Mameyudoufu** sweeps in as the latest addition to our Featured Artist library!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/209/header.jpg)

A staple member of Japanese label *MEGAREX* with songs featured in rhythm games like *Dance Dance Revolution* and *WACCA*, **Mameyudoufu** is a producer with an impressive amount of experience under their belt. As the mastermind behind a fully fresh rhythm-game-esque sound, it's no surprise they've made a splash in tons of rhythm game circles — osu! obviously included.

We've picked up **12** tracks from their ever-so-impressive catalogue, so scramble through them on [**Mameyudoufu**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/209) and find a song (or twelve) to give an attempt at mapping!

[captin1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/689997) has been hyping up the gospel (a.k.a. **Mameyudoufu**'s music) within the osu! community for more than a year, so it's only fitting to showcase this immersive soundscape through a video of captin1's [*Citadel*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1024712) map. Explore that and the rest of the previews below:

Try saying **Mameyudoufu** out loud repeatedly as fast you can. The only thing that can top that level of entertainment is mapping one of the songs from [**Mameyudoufu**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/209), all of which are conveniently timed in advance! Mameyudoufu, Mameyudoufu, Mameyudoufu...

Anyways, that's all until our next artist on Saturday! Stay tuned for that, and if you're feeling an uncontrollable need to click something, the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) is a good option. Clicking circles is a good alternative too.

See you soon!
