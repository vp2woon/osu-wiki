As is tradition at this point, the intrepid artists of the osu! community have outdone themselves (again) and given us all with an impossible choice: choosing only **15** out of all the entrants. This isn't going to be a walk in the park!

To help assist with taking in all this superb art at once, we've prepared a little slideshow set to the tunes of Afternoon Tea by [**Cres.**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/147), one of our ever wonderful Featured Artists:

In a very proud moment, Spring 2021 marks the first year of Fan Art contests ever where nobody (and we mean *nobody*) left the osu! cookie template visible in any of their artworks. Truly a momentous occasion. Celebrate it by heading over to the [**Spring 2021 Fanart Contest listing**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/125) and voting for your favourites today!

The voting will only be open for **7 days**, so get in soon before time rips the opportunity from your fingers like an overzealous pigeon and a piece of bread.

A selection of the top voted entries (most likely to be the top 15, but it could be more depending on how close the votes are) will become this year's Spring seasonal backgrounds.

Good luck!
