**yukitani** joins the lineup as our latest addition to the Featured Artist roster!

Parading an unforgettable persona through his self-designed costume, **yukitani** is the talent behind rhythm game inspired songs that he calls "Nerd" works. His long career as a player of music games has left a lasting impact on his music, granting his unusual songs a perfectly crafted rhythm game feel. With experience ranging from his debut in 2010's *BMS OF FIGHTERS* event to a front-row placement in *CHUNITHM*, **yukitani** managed to ingrain himself in his own community.

Short but sweet, we've snagged **5** tracks from **yukitani**'s collection, all ready for mapping from their [Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/167)!

Older generations of osu! players might already be well-versed with **yukitani**'s sound through a nearly 2-million-play beatmap of [*Kurubukko vs yukitani - Minamichita EVOLVED*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/136632) hosted by [Cherry Blossom](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1156742). Play the map for yourself or watch us run through it in the video below on 5 different osu! setups:
