Today, we celebrate some of the people who make the osu! community truly tick by awarding them our highest honour: the badge of a Community Contributor.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/title.jpg)

osu! is one of the rare bastions still left in the modern-day internet where community is everything. From day one, we've been built up by the tireless efforts of hundreds of individuals who selflessly dedicate themselves towards making things more awesome for everyone.

It is by their efforts that the osu! of today exists, and we thank them by periodically seeking out the exemplars among us and granting them the Community Contributor badge, a signet of their enduring dedication and commitment to the osu! community.

Today, we welcome more into the fold, and perhaps some that should have been welcomed long ago.

We present to you, the latest of the greatest:

## Contributors

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/hallowatcher.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1874761)

**hallowatcher** has had a long and storied history with osu!, but is most renowned for his creation of the now-ubiquitous 'pickems' games that accompany the official World Cups and a number of community tournaments as well. Pickems have since become something of a sensation, attracting well over 5000+ unique users and over 40 variants hosted. So recognized have these games become that several of them have even received official World Cup profile badges in commemoration.

Not only that, **hallowatcher** has developed numerous enduring applications to enhance the lives of tournament organizers everywhere, from website frontends to assistance suites for the ever-taxed referees who help make the scene tick. He is also the creator of [chat4osu](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/879262), an application that retains a significant following to this day and remains one of the handful of apps that can survive the titan that 2018+ osu! has become.

His efforts have quite literally, helped shape a scene for years to come and brought joy to tens of thousands of people. On top of it all, he remains a top-tier tournament competitor himself, which as many can attest, is no small feat on its own.

Belated though it may be, we finally welcome him aboard as a Community Contributor, and a most deserved one at that.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/mangomizer.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718)

When he isn't setting improbable feats of calculation and endurance as the self-titled "osu!taiko masochist", **mangomizer** is an ever-present aid in the World Cup scene, either hosting in or assisting with an absolute glut of projects intended to help brighten up people's day.

A five year plus referee in the osu!taiko World Cup and the cryptic mastermind of many a World Cup bingo or the very aptly named osu! Trivium Quiz, **mangomizer** has without a doubt left a profoundly positive impact upon the community with his efforts, and stands starkly as a rare example of someone who seeks to build with and uplift others, embodying the core osu! spirit of "making things more awesome for everyone".

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/lasse.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/896613)

Though recently retired from the role, during his heyday **Lasse** remained consistently one of the most active members of the Nomination Assessment Team who still attended to the general duties of a normal Beatmap Nominator, advancing to stand at the very pinnacle of the overall kudosu ranking and consistently scoring top tier levels of activity among the BN, doing enough to earn himself a simultaneous Elite Nominator title in the process.

He did all this not only whilst maintaining the workload expected of a NAT member, but also whilst keeping a sizeable presence in mentorship and producing a slew of well-received maps in the process.

But wait, there's more! **Lasse** also has a storied history of reaching out to a huge variety of mappers both fresh and familiar, touting statistics like assisting over 100 unique mappers in 2020 alone, not to mention the years before, all while steadily trekking to well over 50 ranked maps of his own, a 2018 win in the Mapper's Choice Awards, and a solid presence in the Mapper's Guild as a tier 2 (out of 3) contributor.

To sum it up, **Lasse** has done a *lot*. He stands as a shining example of the community-based spirit that makes osu! tick, and we (and the thousands of people's he's helped) are thankful for his efforts over the years.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/spaceman_atlas.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3035836)

Known as [bdach](https://github.com/bdach) on GitHub, **spaceman_atlas** has quickly risen to the fore as one of the most active contributors to osu!lazer’s ongoing development in a large variety of domains.

Since he began in early 2019, he has authored over 763 individual contributions to the project across countless pull requests and issues, rapidly rising to become second among all public osu! contributors across the entire history of the project in barely the space of a year.

His dedication to the very future of the game has proven instrumental in accelerating the pace of osu!lazer’s development significantly, and the handful of wikifriends and lazer contributors among us all know that if there is a question to be answered or data to be crunched, **spaceman_atlas** is never far away.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/rockroller.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8388854)

Heading efforts to help guide the skinning community on osu! for many years, **RockRoller** is a seasoned veteran when it comes to all things involving anime girls and fancy shapes inside your osu! client.

A relatively recent addition to the Global Moderation Team, **RockRoller** almost immediately distinguished himself by wading knee deep into not only several internal efforts to bring our moderation documentation up to date, but also in the development and design of several features that ultimately saved hundreds of manhours across the entire moderation team.

It is clear to any with eyes that his drive to assist in osu!'s continued development is not only skin deep.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/xexxar.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2773526)

Formerly known as **Xexxar**, *I Must Decrease* has been almost solely responsible for several of the recent and long-spanning adjustments to the performance points and star rating algorithm.

**Xexxar**'s efforts have been quite literally keeping the flame alive for hundreds of thousands of progression-craving players who desire change and challenge in their climb up osu!’s global ranking ladder. The depth and complexity of this work cannot be understated - involving vagaries of math and analysis enough to make a lay person’s head spin, along with constant tweaking, sampling and experimentation to ensure things go exactly where they need to be.

Though **Xexxar** has decided to withdraw from the osu! community for the meantime to focus on real life affairs, his work has left a distinct mark on the game for the better, and we have him to thank for much of the evolution of the performance points system in recent times.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/this1neguy.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1797189)

**this1neguy** (affectionately known as t1g) has made a name for himself as a dedicated referee and assistant for over 70 tournaments across osu!, including several World Cup events.

He has moonlighted as a commentator in nearly a dozen events, and continues to demonstrate an exemplary dedication towards osu!’s tournament scene in all of its forms.

Short and sweet though his blurb here may be, his contributions to the scene go beyond description in mere numbers alone, and it is with gratitude that we lift him up to take his rightful place next to the other Mega Referees(™) who have proven so integral to the community tournament scene at large.

## Paragons

Paragons represent the handful of era-defining people that shape the course of a particular game mode. They have gone so far above and beyond the call of duty that they are beacons unto themselves, examples that dictate the future paths a given mode can take, and each and every single one has been utterly instrumental to the development of their mode as a whole.

Until today, osu! remained the last game mode to not formally acknowledge any such people. No longer shall this be the case.

Now, we welcome the two new osu! Paragons:

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/pishifat.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418)

Perhaps the first person to ever appear twice in the Community Contributor series, **pishifat**'s contributions towards osu! are so widespread and numerous at this point that they are almost difficult to count.

From his hundreds of videos discussing modding and mapping topics in a form that undoubtedly introduced thousands (or even tens of thousands) to the craft, to his efforts in developing, maintaining and running the Mappers’ Guild, his continued presence maintaining vital tools and platforms for Beatmap Nominators that enable them to work efficiently and now with his absolutely absurd drive to outreach to as many prospective Featured Artists as humanly possible, it is safe to say without a doubt that **pishifat** has been absolutely integral to the success of osu! in its more recent years as a foundation for some of the most important and active portions and projects of the community.

In light of this, we award **pishifat** not with a second contributor badge, but with something that he has deserved all along: the official acknowledgement that he is in fact, an osu! Paragon.

We all knew anyway, though.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/charles445.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/85000)

Though he may now be retired and roaming the interwebs elsewhere (some of you who play RLCraft may be surprised to see who’s on the contributor list), during an earlier time of osu!, **Charles445** was an era-defining modder and mapper with a unique penchant for discussing and dissecting the minute details of what makes beatmaps truly tick. His tenure in the now-defunct Beatmap Approval Team (a precursor to the modern Nomination Assessment Team) and position as the North American member of the BAT management wing led to a proliferation of his ethics, ideas and concepts into what is now known as the modern age of osu!.

When not tackling the particulars of beatmapping theory, **Charles445** was a world-class mapper, remaining to this date one of very few people to receive an Elite Mapper title twice via individual mapping contest wins. His stunning performance in the first Aspire beatmapping contest catapulted the concept into the public eye, staying true to his legacy of continually testing and reassessing the fabric of what makes beatmaps fun and engaging to play.

At the very heights of his achievements, he never once stopped tackling the same questions and concepts that made him a household name among the modding and mapping scene, and even during retirement he still continues to provide an occasional centering voice on matters of beatmap design.

It is without question that his vast array of contributions over the years entitle him to the status of a osu! Paragon.

## Elite

The Elite within the osu! community have long drawn praise for their exceptional performance in their fields. From Nominator to Mapper and Storyboarder, the Elite lineage has a storied history of encompassing some of osu!'s most diligent and creative minds, and 2020 was no exception.

Today, we honour some of the finest examples from among the Beatmap Nominators, and also issue praise to some long-deserving Storyboarders.

### Nominators

As is tradition, the description for these accolades was collectively written by the members of the Nominator Assessment Team, who know these people better than the backs of their hands.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/mordred.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7265097)

Receiving the accolade two years running, **Mordred**'s performance remains consistently at the top echelon in almost every conceivable and measurable metric we have.

His unrelenting drive to push full length beatmaps has never faltered, and he remains one of the few nominators to make grand efforts to push maps from as many unique mappers as possible.

**Mordred** is becoming synonymous with the Elite title, and for very, very good reason.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/lasse.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/896613)

If being mentioned in a Community Contributor article twice is not prize enough, **Lasse**'s outstanding performance as a Beatmap Nominator (while also being a member of the NAT) should truly emphasise just how incredible his work ethic is.

His presence in the modding scene is difficult to ignore as he consistently checks and pushes beatmaps with superb accuracy and speed, tending to over 100 unique mappers in a single year.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/agatsu.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5579871)

Remaining one of the most active beatmap nominators to date, **Agatsu** is renowned for the level of care he puts into each review and is well respected for being an indisputably solid and supportive modder.

He has since risen to take his place among the Nomination Assessment Team, if that were not indicative enough of his considerable expertise and drive to see the modding and mapping scene improve.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/baar_vendel.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8679346)

Despite only entering the fray less than a year ago, **BaAR_Vendel** has proven themselves to be utterly exceptional at their role.

They have tirelessly helped numerous mappers earn their first ranked map and assisted multitudes more in getting the fabled second set of eyes needed to give a map that extra push through the process, earning themselves a strong reputation as a selfless individual who deeply cares about the mapping and modding community at large.

Very befitting of an Elite Nominator, in our eyes.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/milan.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1052994)

While perhaps not the most active name on the list so far, **Milan-** is certainly one of the most consistent. They have focused on helping as many unique mappers as possible with special attention given to those new to the scene, all without compromising on the quality of the maps that they push forward into Ranked - especially notable as they've received nearly no disqualifications despite a *very* packed 2020.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/eiri.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3388410)

Living in two worlds, **eiri-** is perhaps one of the most interconnected hybrid beatmap nominators there has ever been. Proficient in not one but *two* game modes, **eiri-** has pulling twice their weight in almost flawlessly pushing over 100 osu!taiko beatmaps in 2020 alone plus nearly another 70 in osu! beatmaps, not to mention the fact that they were an Elite Nominator recipient last year as well... for osu!.

This year, they join the ranks in not one, but *two* modes (osu! and osu!taiko), technically making them the first triple recipient of the title.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/raiden.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2239480)

A recent BN+GMT retiree and previous long-time QAT member, **Raiden** is indisputably a household name in the osu!taiko scene, joining a host of individuals who have managed to maintain exemplary nominator activity in their given modes while tending to the difficulties of GMT life.

2020 saw him push more than 120 different osu!taiko beatmaps towards ranked, without a single severe disqualification, showcasing his enormous skill in identifying issues and working with mappers to get them fixed.

While he has since retired from the nominator life in general, we applaud **Raiden**'s pursuit of excellence, and wish him all the best in his endeavours elsewhere.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/jemzuu.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134)

Something of a role model for the osu!catch community, **Jemzuu** remains a most Elite pick from this high fiber bunch.

Their dedication throughout 2020 was impossible to ignore, with their activity registering among the highest not only in pure nominations, but also in the much more tricky quality assurance checks that few BNs dare to dip their toes into.

Much like the other two-year recipients, **Jemzuu** embodies the dedication and spirit that it truly takes to remain (and attain) Elite.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/xinely.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1521445)

Though recently retired from the beatmap nominators for a while, **Xinely**'s four year tenure as an osu!catch expert left a profound mark on the scene, with their top-tier modding quality and noted expertise in lower-level difficulties setting a high standard for the rest of the scene to follow.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/unpredictable.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7560872)

Unsurprising to anyone who is familiar the osu!mania scene, this pick will seem almost... predictable. **Unpredictable** topped the charts for overall nomination activity during 2020 and decided to go a step further, deliberately seeking out despondent mappers who had all but lost hope getting their work seen to, and giving them the attention their creations required.

Their efforts to help salvage the lost creations speaks well enough for their character alone, showcasing the kind of tenacity and drive that makes someone truly Elite.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/rivals_7.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4610379)

Another recent departure from the team, **Rivals_7** sported a long history across four years of consistently being one of the most active and dedicated nominators for osu!mania, well-known to pay special attention towards mappers new to the scene and supporting a vibrant range of keymodes and multi-key sets in their searches.

### Storyboarders

Long the subject of hushed discussions among the highest echelons of the osu!team, the fabled Elite Storyboarders are selected only through exhaustive review of an extensive body of work, making it arguably one of the hardest (if not *the* hardest) Elite titles to achieve.

Today, we welcome two more creators into the fold, as described by our modding and mapping scene advisor [-Mo-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2202163), and accompanied by video compilations from our latest osu!Paragon himself, [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418):

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/tochi.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3664366)

<div align="center">
    <video width="95%" controls>
        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/media/community-contributors-2020/tochi_showcase.mp4" type="video/mp4" preload="none">
    </video>
</div>

Long sporting an extremely impressive portfolio of storyboards, ranging from simple enhancements of a beatmap's background to all-out compliments to both song and beatmap, **-Tochi**'s name is likely very familiar to anyone who has played a super high production value beatmap in recent years.

Undeterred by the creative challenge of marathon length maps, they have risen to the occasion with creations like [\(S\).0ngs//---::compilation.\[TQR-f3\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1124097), which features a stunning 9 minute long storyboard that embarks upon an epic, Sci-Fi and RPG inspired adventure.

Becoming something of a household name among the storyboarding scene for their years of excellence, **-Tochi**'s work never fails to attract or impress, making them a very deserving recipient of the Elite Storyboarder title.

Here's a few highlights from them:

- [Function Phantom - Paradox](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/824125)
- [Camellia - chrono diver -fragment- (Camellia's "crossroads of chrono" remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/419600)
- [PSYQUI - Hype feat. Such (lapix Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1009824)
- [Feryquitous - \(S\).0ngs//---::compilation.\[TQR-f3\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1124097)

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-03-19-community-contributors-2020/yf_bmp.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1243669)

<div align="center">
    <video width="95%" controls>
        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/media/community-contributors-2020/yf_bmp_showcase.mp4" type="video/mp4" preload="none">
    </video>
</div>

Renowned for their notable and distinctive style, **yf_bmp** has long sought to capture the soul and emotion of the songs that their work compliments, showcasing that storyboarding is not always about flashy effects and particles.

An excellent example of this is their work in [Bassdrop Freaks](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/463479), making ample use of bright colours and quick transitions to reflect the upbeat nature of this Camellia and Nanahira classic, and again in [Shiawase no Otoshimono](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/559622), where they masterfully utilize gentle motion and motifs to create a stunning homage to the source material.

Not only that, but **yf_bmp** is the developer and maintainer of the [OSB optimizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/532042) utility, long lauded by the storyboarding scene for its ability to significantly reduce the otherwise cumbersome sizes of many storyboarding projects.

It is plain for any to see the extraordinary amount of effort and care that goes into **yf_bmp**'s creations, and it should be a surprise to nobody that they now join the other creative titans of osu!'s history as one of the Elite Storyboarders.

Here's a few highlights of their work:

- [Chata - enn](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/406217)
- [Nanahira - Bassdrop Freaks (Long Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/463479)
- [Duca - Shiawase no Otoshimono](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/559622)
- [DJ NAGAI feat. a*ru - Benibotan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/548679)
- [Aimer - RE:I AM](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/450885)

---

A big thank you to [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323), [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418), [-Mo-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2202163) and much of the NAT as a whole for their help in compiling, composing videos, selecting and writing most of the Elite section here.

2020 was a tumultuous year for many, but with it has come some of the sharpest increases in osu!'s growth that we have ever seen in over a decade. Accordingly, this list is nowhere near exhaustive in giving gratitude to those who help make the community a better place, and we know there are dozens more people waiting in the wings for their moment in the spotlight.

We're very thankful that osu! remains to be shaped so closely by its community, and we'll endeavour as a team to foster this attitude in the newest generation of osu! players and beyond. It is only through the community's efforts that things have persisted for as long as they have, and we'll always remember this.

To all those who contribute, no matter how big or small it may be, you have our gratitude, and we look forward to sharing and honouring your accolades in the future.

—the osu!team
