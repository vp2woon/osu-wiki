**Empty Peperoncino** jumps into the Featured Artist lineup!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/145/header.jpg)

Hopping in with a new taste of Japanese rock, [**Empty Peperoncino**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/145) is a net-based doujin band comprised of vocalist *Ranko*, lyricist *Masato Ito* and composer *Ryota*. Delivering an upbeat experience paired with high energy vocals, these tracks could easily be compared to our very own [*namirin](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/18) or [Aitsuki Nakuru](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/127) while leaning more towards classic band instrumentation.

We've rounded up **9** bright 'n' shiny new tracks from **Empty Peperoncino**'s currently released album and EP, sure to scratch that J-rock itch.

Looking for a sample? Give [Hazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4668230)'s mapset of [*End Roll*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1361717) a try, or watch [Kingling](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7010761) attempt it with some of lazer's unranked mods:

Hopefully not a surprise to anyone, these tracks and a handful more are now available from [**Empty Peperoncino**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/145), already timed and patiently waiting to be picked up by a mapper (that's you!).

The week may be over, but we're nowhere close to done with our Featured Artist releases! Check in next week to see a few more awesome artists, or follow the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) if that's more your thing.

Until then!
