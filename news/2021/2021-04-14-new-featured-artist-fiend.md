We're happy to welcome **fiend** into the Featured Artist lineup!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/156/header.jpg)

A trailblazer in his own musical niche, **fiend** is an Australian producer renowned for his iconic remix-based drum & bass tracks implementing themes from a diverse spread of genres like fierce rap, ambient trap, and simple EDM.

We rounded up **5** tracks from **fiend**'s ever-popular *FEVER DREAM* album. While selection may be limited, each of these songs is an experience unlike any other, lending to more mapping opportunities than you'd expect from the short tracklist.

Anyone who hasn't heard **fiend** is missing out. It's the honest truth. If you need an introduction, this cursor-tracking gameplay of the title track [*FEVER DREAM (feat. yzzyx)*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1405913) mapped by [Niva](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/197805) is a perfect starting point, followed by any of the previews below:

As per usual, you can find a few more beats to fawn over on [**fiend**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/156), all with timing handled by us and mapping soon-to-be-handled by none other than you.

And before anyone mentions it, we unfortunately couldn't pick up the song *Morrissey* due to unlicensed samples. Sometimes that's just how the cookie crumbles, sorry!

Anyway, what could be better than **fiend**? "Two fiends" is the answer we're looking for, but if you answered "a new Featured Artist coming this Saturday", we'll give you partial credit. Stick around the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for news on that and we'll see you soon.
