Set out on an adventure through chiptune paradise with our new Featured Artist **Chroma**!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/215/header.jpg)

A more-than-familiar name to anyone floating in the rhythm game universe, **Chroma** is a Japanese producer best known for their emotionally iconic 8-bit soundscape. With features in games like *SOUND VOLTEX*, *GROOVE COASTER*, *CHUNITHM*, and *maimai*, **Chroma** is beyond overdue for inclusion in our Featured Artist collection!

Ranging from hyper-intense to calm and expressive, **20** of **Chroma**'s tunes are available from [their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/215), including classics like *Dark Sheep* and *lost memory*.

Dive into **Chroma**'s catalogue with a showcase of [*Chroma - sink to the deep sea world*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/779495) — an incredibly difficult 9.5 star beatmap played by some of osu!'s most competent circle clickers. Check everything out below:

We hate to admit it, but there's more to life than clicking circles. In reality, placing circles in the editor is the peak of human existence, so tread on down to [**Chroma**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/215) for all the pre-timed beatmap templates your mapping heart desires.

Electronic music may be usual fare for rhythm games, but this weekend we'll be shifting towards traditional instrumentation in the J-rock sphere. Stalk the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) to figure out what that could entail. See you soon!
