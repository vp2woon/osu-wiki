2021 was an incredible year for many circle clickers, some even with record-breaking performances in solo play and tournaments. As the year draws to a close, we're sending things off with the **9th iteration of the international top 20 voting**, using the community-run [Clicker's Choice](https://choice.hwc.hr/) website!

For those unaware, the osu! community has typically hosted a yearly top 20 vote on any number of platforms in the past with no real centralized place to handle anything. This year's top 20 vote will be run on the Clicker's Choice website, which is also home to the top player voting for Germany, Poland, Canada, UK and many other countries.

As a voter, it's pretty straightforward — just [visit the site](https://choice.hwc.hr/vote/6), link your osu! account and start voting! **Everything from the criteria to the deadlines is also available on the voting page.**

Check out a quick preview of just how easy it is to get involved below:
