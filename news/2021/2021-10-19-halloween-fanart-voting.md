It has happened again.

Something about Halloween just gets the artists in the osu! community raring to go, and the rest of us are now left with the most terrifying task of all: choosing only **20** entries to make the final cut!

This won't be easy, but then again, when is it ever? If this is your first time voting in one of our fanart contests, welcome to the madness.

To kick the voting off in appropriately Halloween splendour, here's a brief clip of some of the entries in the running set to the tunes of *that's some spooky stuff* by [**meganeko**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/75), one of our absurdly talented Featured Artists:

[**CLICK HERE to go straight to the Halloween 2021 Fanart Contest voting page and vote today!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/135)

The votes will only stay open for **7 days** before reanimated ghouls will drag it down into the dirt and out of sight forever (at least until we unveil the finalists anyway), so make sure you get in quick!

As usual, a choice selection of the top voted entries (anywhere from 15 to 20 depending on how the voting goes) will make it into the game as our Halloween seasonal backgrounds and award their artists with a neat bit of osu!supporter, and even profile badges for the top three to boot.

Good luck to all, artists and entrants both!
