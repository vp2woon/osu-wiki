We're proud to welcome **Amidst** on board as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/151/header.jpg)

Hailing from the artistic hub of San Francisco, **Amidst** is an electronic producer with an breathtaking talent for just about anything in the electronic music scene. With influences ranging from hype rhythm game songs to Chinese orchestral music, his sound is a special blend of electronic that only he is capable of putting together.

We've snagged a solid **27** tracks from his future bass and EDM-filled catalogue, all available from [**Amidst**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/151)!
