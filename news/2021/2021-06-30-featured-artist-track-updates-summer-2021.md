While we've been busy pumping out new Featured Artists left and right, some of our older talent have been working hard too! We've added over **60** songs from **13** of our current Featured Artists, so come see what's new!

We're keeping things simple: **click an artist's name or banner to visit their Featured Artist page.** All new songs are marked with a very very very cool *NEW* icon.

New songs are also listed below along with any relevant ranked maps and an audio preview or two. These should give you a quick impression of what's in store, but also remember that all song previews are available from each Featured Artist page!

Coming as a surprise to nobody, we've officially added [**TWC Sound Team "Zeroth Powers" - One One**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1422682) from the [osu!taiko World Cup 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2021) Grand Finals to the Featured Artist listings for [BilliumMoto](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3862471), [Dictate](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/21), and [Kurokotei](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/58)!

Like *Camellia - ΩΩPARTS* and *TWC Sound Team "Zeroth Powers" - One One*, this track was specifically created for the world cups — a trend you'll likely see going forward!

Shifting away from the rhythm gamey electronic scene, **glass beach** is here with some special guests from their recent collaborative album *alchemist rats beg bashful (remixes)*! We snagged **5** of these tracks, including a cover of the famed [*glass beach - bedroom community*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1198613)!

- [**Umeboshi Chazuke vs. Morimori Atsushi - Pico\*2 Funkoter\***](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1061110) mapped by [Murumoo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8001433)

[*Station Earth - Cold Green Eyes feat. Roos Denayer*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/371128) is an osu! classic at this point. The song's creator **Blue Marble** (previously known as **Station Earth**) re-designed the track in a whole new way, so we've added it to their Featured Artist listing!

### Station Earth - Cold Green Eyes feat. Roos Denayer (Blue Marble VIP)

## [UNDEAD CORPORATION](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/45)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/45/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/45)

Speaking of remakes of popular osu! songs, **UNDEAD CORPORATION**'s latest release is a sequel to the insanely popular [*Everything will freeze*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/158023). Both the vocal and instrumental versions are up for grabs, so pick up whichever you like!

That's all for now!

With the conclusion of these updates, we'd also like to make a formal apology. We've overwhelmed you with too much awesome music at once. We'll take a step back for the next 3 days and think about our actions, then announce another Featured Artist on Saturday.

Stay tuned to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) and we'll see you then!
