We're proud to boost **Reku Mochizuki** into the Featured Artist lineup!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/163/header.jpg)

Illustrating some of the rhythm gaming scene's finest talent in recent years, **Reku Mochizuki** is a Japanese composer and producer with roots in doujin music culture. Taking inspiration directly from other rhythm game composers, the power behind his works resonates with players worldwide, as seen through his countless features in other rhythm games like *Dynamix*, *RAVON*, and *Muse Dash*.

We've hand-picked **12** tracks for your mapping needs, all standing at the perfect game-size 2 minute mark and up for grabs on [**Reku Mochizuki**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/163).

Since **Reku Mochizuki** is a relatively new face to osu!, folks from the [Mappers' Guild](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild) set up a batch of [showcase beatmaps](/wiki/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_showcase_beatmaps) for you to experience this sound for yourself. Check those out below or watch the mapper [Yugu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3161834)'s hydraulic pressed sliders on his map of [*Yorixiro*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1438879):

The songs above are only a taste of what we've got in store on [**Reku Mochizuki**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/163). Don't sleep on the rest of these tracks if you're looking for a quick rhythm gamey song to pour your next few hours into!

Did you know we'll announce a whole 100 artists in 2021 if we keep up our current pace? Keeping up with all the talent around here can be hard at times, so tracking the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) might help. Even if it doesn't help though, at least you'll be notified about the artist we announce next Wednesday!

Stay tuned until then!
