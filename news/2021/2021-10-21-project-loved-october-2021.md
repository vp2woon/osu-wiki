The spookiest month of the year is upon us and Project Loved brings back the best maps from the grave.

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)

To those who need a quick refresher, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the Loved Captains of their respective game modes. Each banner in the news post will redirect you to the respective beatmap's poll, or you can view them all directly on the Project Loved forum [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process only lasts for 10 days, so remember to cast your votes! You can read more about this project on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved)!

As usual, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the September votes. We hope you enjoyed the massive 4-year celebratory round and are having fun with the new maps added to the Loved category! If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

Last month, Project Loved celebrated its 4th birthday, and we celebrated by giving you the biggest Project Loved vote yet with a whopping 37 nominations! But did you know that October also marks another big milestone? That's right, the Loved category itself is celebrating its [5th birthday this month](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-10-17-here-comes-the-love)! Time really does fly when you're having fun, huh? If you're feeling especially nostalgic, [check out the first ever Loved beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/106318)! Looking back, it's interesting how much of a difference 5 years can make to anything, and Loved is certainly no exception. We at Project Loved hope to continue providing the community with the best of your favorite maps for many more years to come.

Much like Loved itself, our very own [Project Loved website](https://loved.sh/) is continuing to get support and updates! On top of several quality of life improvements being added, such as pagination for submissions, the community has been hard at work at making sure the website is accessible to all, with the website being translated into Bulgarian, German and Italian since last month! Thank you everyone for the contributions! As always, if you'd like to contribute to the on-going development efforts, please visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cl8n/project-loved-web/) to get started.

With time continuing to march on and with Project Loved's scope continuing to increase each month, we always have new faces joining us as well as others departing. This month, the osu!mania captain roster is seeing a major overhaul. Some of you may already recognize [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063) — one of our most dedicated metadata reviewers on the Project Loved Team and a seasoned Beatmap Nominator. Going forward, on top of assisting with beatmap metadata, they will also lend a hand to the osu!mania captain team alongside the prestigious [DannyPX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11253722) and the one and only [Paturages](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479). Please give them a warm welcome!

However, with a whopping three new osu!mania captains joining, one of our most influential osu!mania captains is unfortunately retiring, as [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576) has announced her resignation from Project Loved. Wanting to move forward to bigger and greater things is always an admirable goal and we would like to wish -mint- only the best, as she has been responsible for some of the most critically-acclaimed nominations to the osu!mania Loved category during her 17-month runtime as a captain and osu!mania coordinator. Thank you for your service and we hope your future plans turn out better than expected!

Alright, enough said. Let’s get on with this month’s nominations.

*description written by [UberFazz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8646059)*

A map that's garnered quite the attention over the past few years, Adlol's map of *Illegal Paradise (Grimoire rmx)*, or better known as *Illegal Gothic*, is finally being put up for voting! This rather simple set of 2 difficulties filled with bursts and jumps definitely belongs in the Loved section and is long overdue. Check it out if you haven't played it already!

*description written by [UberFazz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8646059)*

Mismagius makes his return to Loved with another tech map of a speedcore track by a beloved Featured Artist, Kobaryo. *HUG AND KILL* is an erratic track which the mapper takes full advantage of by utilizing fast sliders and spaced 1/4 patterns, making for a really difficult map. However, if you're not up to the challenge of the top diff, there's a lower diff that's much more tame in its difficulty. Try either one and see which one suits you more! ^w^

Returning to Loved after nearly a year, 0ugi's map of *Konran Shoujo Soflan-chan!!* is insane. A quick look in the editor will show you the ridiculous amount of effort that went into... well, everything. But the part that really stands out is the timing. This song [changes timing signatures and BPM every few seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtK0C0ycY-w)... and that makes it really really fun. So go play it. Right now. *soflan\~ soflan\~ soflan lan\~*

166 BPM, 3:34 | 7.21★\
*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

This 7\* 166 BPM map really blurs the line between what you would consider alt or not, yet that definition matters not, as with the mix between alt, cut and spaced stream patterns, *w/WWW* is a fast-paced map with no time to think of that. Including those aforementioned cut and spaced streams is a pleasantly flowing map with even higher-spaced doubles fitting in perfectly. This is -Tynamo's second Loved map to go up for voting, so I hope you enjoy his comeback to the category as much as I do.

*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

Although known throughout the tournament community for many NM1 maps, Skyflame has yet to attain a Loved map, and what better opportunity than putting up the All Stars Show Match 3 NM1 up for Loved voting. Sitting at 8.1 stars and 204 BPM, this jump map has lots of cross-screens, and even a spaced stream in the mix, coming together for a consistently difficult yet enjoyable map. Hopefully this *Sweet Maiden* of a map is as enticing to you as many others have found it to be.

We have a classic of a YTPMV tune right here, with a fun beatmap to go with it! This Brazilian collab set of *Blend W* brings you a wide range of high-energy maps at 152 BPM, mostly at an extra to insane level of difficulty. The smooth spaced bursts throughout wind around, and the high slider velocity keeps your cursor bouncing. The hardest of the difficulties even have some 1/4 jumps and very fast sliders to contend with!

With this set containing a full spread that covers players of every skill level, and with over 470 favorites, we're not the only ones who enjoy taking a hit of this map. Check it out for yourself and see what the fuss is about!

I don't think rustbell has ever once failed to deliver with his maps, but let's take a closer look at this one in particular. Two minutes long, 220 BPM, and filled with some of the most creative uses of sliders the game has ever seen. This map perfectly captures the true essence of what a truly difficult osu! map has to offer, and ultimately, it's at the top of the list when it comes to unique experiences and challenges.

134 BPM, 1:53 | 1.68★ – 10.28★\
*description written by [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983)*

Snow Note (formerly known as 7odoa) is well known for making high-difficulty beatmaps since 2013. Of all their creations, this is one of their most infamous boss maps. *Shoujo no Maisou* is a unique challenge set that will not only test your mechanics with its 268 BPM jumps, but also your reading. Most of this set has an approach rate lower than 9, and its snappy patterns and stop-start rhythm can be very deceiving.

This map contains a full spread of difficulties, but the most well known of them is the Ghost difficulty. At over 7 stars, paired with high density at AR 8.2, it's a tough one. However, if that isn't enough for you, the Undefined difficulty is absolutely outrageous with mechanics only seen in maps over 10 stars, all on a low approach rate! Even so, I'm sure someone reading this can tame that beast.

A jump-heavy mapset with a rather spooky twist, this is one for those looking for something different in an aim map!

asuasu_yura's maps aren't very drastic. There are no fancy effects and fewer SV changes compared to today's mapping styles, but his pure pattern placements are done so well and are praised by many people regardless of their taste. *Onegai Darling* by asuasu_yura is one of the best beatmaps representing his stick-to-the-basics mapping style. It has been played a lot by many people and has gotten constant love with its nicely made chart as well as its great song choice. While stylish SV changes and effects are fun, sometimes chilling with plainly-styled beatmaps like this one won't leave you in regret!

The much-anticipated and very popular speed map will be put to a vote! I'm sure people in the osu!taiko community have played it before, right? The name of that map is *Koiiro Iris (brz_bootleg_remix)* by shinchikuhome! This map is fast at 310 BPM, but it's mainly composed of 1/2 and 1/4 triplets, so it's a good map for people who aren't confident with speed maps. It is also a great warm-up map for those who are confident in their skills due to its moderate difficulty level. If you're curious, please play and participate in the voting!

300 BPM, 3:29 | 7.91★\
*description written by [Gamelan4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9856910)*

There is no doubt that among taiko players, speed maps are one of the most popular map types, and you will always see at least one of them being picked in a multiplayer lobby. *Eva (Under Construction Remix)* by EJ_\_ fits perfectly into this description, being a fairly popular pick among high-SR lobbies. Featuring long chains of 1/4 bursts at 300 BPM, with balanced and well-placed density drops to not completely overkill players, this map certainly shows a high quality from a mapper that has yet to receive the recognition they deserve.

If you love having those intense key smashing sessions, or just want to test and expand your limits, this is your map!

*description written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

The Loved scene has received quite a few pretty spicy maps in the last few months, and we're looking to tone it down a bit. *Chariot* by uone is a very popular map ever since it has been picked in a few tournaments, making it a perfect fit as a milder version of the often spotlighted tech maps. Slowjammed complex rhythms, 1/8 doublet sections and multiple snappings in a stream are the *capsaicin* of this map, and even though it's way below other maps, it sure will make a burn!

*description written by [Horiiizon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8071438)*

In contrast to the *Chariot* map above, *dancing on the sidewalk lights flicker* by Ulqui is packed with extreme SV changes non-stop throughout the entirety of the map. Featuring constant overlaps and SV ranging from 0.5 to 2.5, this song demands your full attention from start to finish, and if you combine that with some difficult patterns (especially the stream that fills the entire second kiai), it comes together to make a very challenging, chaotic and unique map that you'll be sure to remember!

*Heaven's Fall* is a fairly simple map from a mapper like tasuke, who is known for his end-game style of mapping, but that is what makes this taiko diff so refreshing. Featuring some consistent and comfortable patterning, with some spicy 1/6 bursts from time to time, this map is perfect for anyone searching for simple yet entertaining content among all the challenging maps the Loved section provides.

Camellia and Dika312, two names that are both pretty familiar, so no need for a big introduction. With a banger like this, what can you expect? A quite challenging map of course! The BPM going all the way up to 220 makes this map a perfect tech/speed map featuring a lot of zig-zags and kick sliders with very little time to slow down just to catch your breath. The approach rate of 9.9 makes this a very good map for a lot of people to get used to higher end maps, to push you up the ladder just a little bit further. Are you ready to take on the Final Boss that Dika has created?

Nelly's older style focuses more on the playability and flow than any of our modern maps, which makes the map simple yet still entertaining to play, especially for the mid-level players who are getting used to Overdose levels! A lot of favorites proves that this map has been favored by a lot of players, both in multiplayer lobbies and solo. I would strongly recommend this map to those who have just started playing Overdose difficulties, but want to challenge their limits, and to those who want to enjoy something comfortable and simple, rather than complex and difficult patterns.

One might expect this song to be a (very) hard map like the others in this round of osu!catch Loved, but rather surprisingly this is a multi-difficulty set by our dear Bunnrei and Magic Girl, with a top difficulty that is a bit shy of 6 stars. Despite the somewhat lower difficulty, it is still quite exciting and explosive to play, which is also why this map got picked in the osu!catch Catch the Magic! tournament. Funzies for everyone, ya- I mean todoke!

So go, try it out, slap on some mods if you are a skilled player, and have yourself a blastin' 1 minute and 39 seconds!

Despite not being active for a long time now, Minato Yukina has created a lot of infamous maps during their prime. One of these maps is *V³ (Hello World)*. All it takes is listening to the song to know that this map is going to be brutal.

The main attraction of this map are the very unconventional pattern choices that you usually never see in catch mapping because they require insane catcher control. Not to mention that this map is quite fast so in addition to the catcher control you also need speed to play it properly.

If you think you have what it takes to tackle this map, give it a shot.

Yup. This is the one of the most ever played, most favorited (999 at time of writing!) mapsets from the unranked section. Of course we wouldn't let that one go forever unnoticed, roaming and haunting the graveyards forever. Like a ghost. *Ha*. Get it. As we say goodbye to -mint- as a Loved captain, her staple mapset of Camellia's *GHOST* will also say goodbye to the unranked section. And would there be a better goodbye than digging in the deepest confines of her haunted closet and pulling a fresh 2017 entry from it?

This entry puts in perspective the years mint has put in the community: for those who are able to play the top difficulties, you may notice a very distinctively different vibe and style from more recent maps like [*OOPARTS*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1505323#mania/3083481). In fact, even comparing 2017 mint to 2019 mint through the GHOST-NOVA difficulty (which may or may not feel more difficult than the SPECTRE one, despite the star rating) makes it obvious that this mapset is a relic of the past (expect a fair amount of reading SV), but putting it in the Loved section will remind us that every mapper has gone through countless stages of growth from start to finish.

Imagine submitting [Vol. 2B](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/547215) for Loved first. The captains clearly know their ABCs really well ⁠— or I guess I should say BAC now. Is there even a Vol. 2C? Anyways, if sending Vol. 2B to the Loved section made sense, then why not put in Vol. 2A as well? Better late than never.

The second volume of *Jumpstream of Fighters*, a straightforward homage and shoutout to the [BMS of Fighters compilation series](https://www.bmsoffighters.net/), was released on the [*Flash Flash Revolution* forums in 2016](https://www.flashflashrevolution.com/vbz/showthread.php?p=4500875) and converted as a whole pack for osu!mania, with Leo137 leading the effort. This pack features many familiar names you might recognize besides Leo: sunnyglasses, swiftwinter, Klaius, porkypink, AZVW_2, 10Dollar, blaziken, and Akuma123.

Despite its age, its legacy and lack of a [14-minute non-stop jumpstream marathon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/547215#mania/1159167), it's still a quite decent training pack for intermediate players. Players progressing between the 4th and 8th dans should find more than enough food for improvement with these files: their density in terms of patterning is quite a bit higher than average, while also featuring many split jumptrills, many one-handed shenanigans and exercises, as well as some amount of handstreams. I know I had fun playing through it myself while writing this description.

What are you waiting for? Go ahead, *jump in* and cast your vote to compete on this collection of bangers!

For most chordjack players this is but a piece of history. A long awaited pack waiting to be given the spotlight. And here it finally is for everyone to rejoice upon!

Most players should at least know what LTD has done for the chordjack community. This is but one of their most acclaimed packs ever. Truly a legacy that's only going to be set in stone once given its proper place in the Loved section. But for anyone who was unaware, the pack HEAVILY focuses on chordjacks. However, this is not your run-of-the-mill pack. Without a doubt, *LTD Pack has* by far a very solid collections of high end, high octane charts. One of them in particular is in fact, *and by fact*, the most infamous chordjack map ever, that being *[Skan - Give It To Dem](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1206088#mania/2511383)*.

In any case, for anyone searching for a peak quad chordjack-oriented pack, this is **BY FAR** the best chance you'll ever have at finding it!

*P.S: The Project Loved Team is not responsible for any harm caused while playing such physically demanding charts. We heavily suggest warming up. Most importantly: **good luck**. You're going to need it.*

Did you get that? notapplicable certainly got the attention of many with Halogen's (not the [player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/169992)) incredibly catchy and [highly acclaimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpvrmgKjvys) single *U Got That*. Astute players may have already seen and encountered this map in multiplayer lobbies and gotten themselves into scrolling surprises, and there is no doubt that the notoriety and popularity of the map itself warrants its inclusion among the Loved roster.

Learning this map does not come free of charge: rhythm identification and memorization is paramount in order to grasp and pass the iconic drops. However, the song being as catchy as it is, the learning experience feels fabulously satisfying: the scrolling variations augment and complement the high energy and impact of the song, providing a full audiovisual cocktail once mastery is achieved.

Overall, *U Got That* is an excellent and engaging entry into harder SVs and you can welcome notapplicable's very first Loved nomination with open arms now by casting your vote!

*Angel's Salad ("Le mythe tendu" ver.)* is probably one of the most interesting tech maps of this year, and definitely Penguinosity's first mapset nominated for Project Loved.

This chart has been a crowd favourite amongst both players and mappers, and for a very good reason. As a rice-only technical map, it's about as erratic and exhausting as it can get. Relentless jacks, bursts, rhythm changes and streams are split into two major sections. The song introduces a dark, ominous breakcore setting and the musical structure is very complex, leading to all kinds of different patterns following one another. Because of this, full-comboing this chart takes some respectable skill and focus, and pairing it with good accuracy is exponentially more difficult.

Penguinosity did a great and clean job with this chart. Although highly chaotic, the patterns make so much sense and are smoothly linked, and there's also a noticeable style and repetitiveness which greatly help with comprehension of this map. It is a highly dynamic and challenging work that yields a lot of competitive potential. Go ahead and vote for *Angel's Salad*!

And here comes not one, but two newcomers into the Loved section! Both AlexDunk and lovely_hyahya have presented the community with their unique take on Camellia's *fiиorza*.

While Alex's take ended up as an entry-level map in the set, Lovely's increased layering and emphasis will surely be of help for those seeking for an even greater challenge. Both difficulties offer a rather wide variety of rice patterns, each one ensuring that the patterns stay within their intended difficulty ranges. So if you end up liking one of the maps, you'll most probably end up liking the other one as well, because conceptually they are pretty much the same! If you think Alex's take might be too easy for you, Lovely's version might put up a bit more of a challenge.

We hope that AlexDunk's and lovely_hyahya's debuts become well received. But most importantly, we hope that the players get to enjoy the amazing work from both of them!

Quite a while since we've seen Abraxos on the Loved scene, and their comeback is nothing short of a surprise.

Without a doubt this has to be one of the most unique maps that were seen back in the Finals mappool for MWC 2020. This chart is nothing short of tricky. It holds no punches back, but it heavily rewards those who can overcome the trickiness involved in its patterns by offering 2 minutes and 35 seconds of fun!

Abraxos was able to really convey the intensity of *Heathens (Magnetude Bootleg)* with the patterning. But do not be deceived with its rather slow start! The hybrid-tech approach taken makes the map a rollercoaster of events, of emotions, of experiences. Holding your guard down for just a second can be anyone's demise if they cannot keep up with the map's complexity. But this was none of a challenge for everyone fierce enough to have reached Finals that year.

For anyone yearning to play the most unconventional yet fun and unique maps, wanting this up should be a no-brainer! And we're more than happy to shed some light to a map as amazing as this.

FelixSpade makes their first appearance to the Loved votings, with their awesome map of *Despair of ELFERIA*. To give a bit of a briefing on who Felix is, they're a well-known hardworking member of the charting community who has been putting out high quality charts for years at this point. Felix has specifically built up a good reputation amongst LN enthusiasts for having some real standout maps, one of which we have here today.

*Despair of ELFERIA* is as heavily layered and intense as the song it's reflecting, never skipping a beat to be as engaging and challenging as it can be. The LNs are executed quite tastefully, as Felix knew exactly where to layer things heavier and lighter depending on which point of the song you're in. Besides that, I think it's also worth mentioning that this chart has been used in numerous large-scale tournaments, such as [SOFT 5](/wiki/Tournaments/SOFT/5), and others which can be found on the map page.

It's not easy to make a four-minute long LN map as well put together as this, so hats off to Felix. We're happy to bring you this crowd-favorite, as well as Felix's first map to the Loved section, and we look forward to what the future may bring for them!

As we welcome DannyPX among the new Loved captains, we also welcome him into the Loved section with one of his most popular sets: *Cyberia Lyr3*, by Featured Artist [Sewerslvt](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/169). DannyPX charts a lot. And by a lot, we mean A LOT: it would be quite an incredible achievement for a seasoned player to *not* have encountered one of his maps in a tournament.

*Cyberia Lyr3* features 2 difficulties with an array of rates for chordjack training of different varieties: Scalpels is a straightforward and fair introduction to average-density chordjacks with deliberate anchors complementing the song, while Razor Blades amps up the density a fair amount and puts a lot more emphasis on triple and quadruple chords, as well as added technicality and two-hand trills in transitions. With the 1.0x rate starting from 200 BPM (translating to 100 BPM chordjacks — do not be afraid), this mapset is fairly accessible and provides food for healthy improvement on a focused skillset.

Have you watched [*Serial Experimentals Lain*](https://anilist.co/anime/339/serial-experiments-lain/) yet? As the song samples the original source, we greatly recommend checking it out after, of course, casting your vote!

No, this is not [that infamous ~~quaddable~~ SV from random multiplayer lobbies](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/474184#mania/1012986). This flip will blow your perception of the original away: this is *not* your casual, slow amen break. 96-glass's interpretation goes balls to the wall with intensity, providing almost three and a half minutes of uninterrupted information to your ears.

hna has been an attentive and proactive mapper: while this is her very first Loved nomination, you may already know her through her [ranked mapset of Yuuyu's *Scrap Syndrome*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1378602#mania/2848697) or through any of her ruthless, instrumental and mechanical technical works. *Shiawase ni nareru kakushi amenbreak ga arurashii* is a perfect showcase of what her technical mapping looks like.

Do not get caught off-guard: even the 1.0x rate, despite its fairly average star rating, is extremely aggressive from start to finish and will get you gasping for a sliver of respite in the small windows of rest this map provides. If this is not enough for you, rates up to 1.3x are also available for competition.

You do not need a cheat code to go ahead and vote for this entry, so I suggest you go do that now.

*description written by [Penguinosity](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10235296)*

Yo listen up, here's a Flexo map!

Flexo is back to the Loved votings, with this tricky full LN map of the all-time classic — *Blue* by Eiffel 65.

This map is a hellfest of full LN reading/control. You might not think that the patterning looks difficult at first, but at 128 BPM, the control required to not miss everywhere is immense. Long notes are like a spectrum of difficulty, where as a map like this is (in my opinion), incomparable to the difficulty of something like Flexo's equally as LN-centered *[Kawaki Wo Ameku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/919643#mania/1920630)*. The ladder is tricky by no doubt and tests both your ability to read and play fast, but with *Blue*, the emphasis is entirely on your reading and finger control which tends to be the case with LN maps at this speed.

*Blue* immediately shows you what it's all about, as you see the subdued-sounding intro immediately turn into an inverse wall, but that's not the only thing you should be expecting. Flexo mixes in ample amounts of rice and LN stoppage, which can really add another layer of difficulty on top of trying to manage your finger-independence. And this is really what you can expect from the map, a tasteful yet highly difficult test of your slower-paced LN abilities.

Both this map and song are what I think we can call a change of pace for Loved, as maps like this haven't been going up as often as they probably should. Like I said above, the LN skillset is a spectrum, and we are making sure that all areas of it are represented consistently with what gets put up. Big thanks to Flexo for putting this together, and as always being such an important figure in the 7K community. Make sure to give your vote!

*description written by [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750)*

Another fun chart by Kawawa, *Amenohoakari* enters the Loved voting! The community has grown accustomed to Kawawa's simple but effective style of charting and this chart is a great example of his proficiency in 7K mapping.

There are two diffs in the mapset. The easier one is a pleasant and fluent introduction to chordstreams and doublestair patterning — many of them are isolated and visually pronounced. The density is fairly high for this type of map, but it certainly feels way more approachable for 7K adepts because of how well it plays.

On the other hand, the harder difficulty builds on the chordstream theme even more with some respectable broken dense chordstream sections. Once again, they're incredibly smooth and well-patterned. If that wasn't enough, there are some scarce minijacks added into the mix — you cannot let your guard down! Luckily, the BPM is more than manageable, so very good players might attempt to play both of these difficulties on Double Time.

The oriental vibes of *Amenohoakari* are greatly expressed in this fun and simple beatmap, and we're happy to expand the 7K Loved collection!

It's time to play some Long Notes, as we're coming in hot with a high-level 7K pack by Pengdoll! It's been a long time coming but we are finally bringing Pengdoll's first map to the Loved section, someone who is also well-known as "LCH" in the O2Jam community. Due to recent demands from the community for high-level content, we decided that the best first map to choose from Pengdoll would be their ever-difficult *BOSS Map Collection*.

This pack provides many familiar songs to rhythm game players and is loaded to the brim with LNs, with all songs being incredibly challenging. The overall patterning of these charts consists of LNs, and other various layerings which will test both your reading ability as well as your stamina. One saving grace to let up on the brutality of this pack is the relatively low OD, which will give players some leniency on the accuracy front. Nevertheless, everything in this pack is really competitive, and all of the diffs will be very hard to play even if you're a high-level player.

If you are up for a challenge on high-level LN mapping, then try your shot with Pengdoll's *BOSS Map Collection*!

78.12 BPM, 1:51 | 2.91★\
*description written by [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750)*

If I were to choose the most infamous 7K tournament chart, I'd probably go with this one. *Avril 14th* as mapped by the 7K gimmick and technical specialist Nivrad00 is a truly map like none other.

Hidden behind a very modest star rating of 2.91, *Avril* packs an incredibly... cursed punch in the form of very complex 7K half-inverses. Indeed, the chart is focused on slow, precise and controlled finger movements that require a fair amount of finger-independency to pull off. This is obviously way harder than it sounds and for some players this type of map may be much more difficult than 6-7\* chordstreams or even other LN charts.

What's more, the patterns used are mostly focused on two-handed split control instead of usual stream-like patterning. The result is so uncommon that this map can be memorized just like an SV chart, which is a very peculiar experience. All of this to an 8-bit arrangement of the classic Aphex Twin track.

You may love or hate *Avril*, but give this map a try since it is just as interesting as it is cursed. It has been there for quite some time and we firmly believe that charts like it have a special place in the Loved category, especially since there aren't many of them in the first place.

*Deep in Abyss* is another well-known chart by the 7K LN mapping veteran LostCool should really have a shot at getting a leaderboard! This map has steadily built up traction over 4 years and is a great showcase of the mapper's interesting and spectacular style.

As a rather difficult map, it combines many types of different patterns, both focused on LN and speed. The characteristic choruses with very repetitive patterning put an emphasis on outward stairs and speedy long notes. There are also numerous minijacks scattered throughout the chart and it's one of these cases where they actually compliment the map and increase the amount of control needed, meaning that getting a high combo here can be challenging.

The playful nature of the song is well reflected in the map's flow that always finds a way to entertain a player with a new pattern, but at the same time comes back to what the player has already seen. The OD isn't too high to allow some leniency for timing the ubiquitous LN stairs and bursts. Vote for *Deep in Abyss* NOW!

*Cait Sith* here, is a collaborative effort between Yunabi, SYISHI and qodtjr. Being a joint set, the original uploads for what you see here were separate, uploaded by both Yunabi and qodtjr respectively. These two sets rivaled each other in popularity, and so we at the Loved team reached out to both mappers to see if they would join the two together, and here we are! In the process of this, we are truly happy to bring you all the first nominations from Yunabi and SYISHI!

These maps grew to popularity quite recently and it's clear to see why. All of the diffs flow very smoothly, using varying patterns that get denser as the piano and drums build up to their climax throughout this eclectic song. There's also a focus of simple streams, hand speed, tasteful LNs, and some tricky jacks/minijacks that you'll likely not forget. To talk about qodtjr's difficulty specifically, it comes in with chordstreams which consist of doubles and triples, and it also presents some LN usage, heavy jacking and brackets. The original set by him can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/997590#mania/2815325) for anyone interested.

Overall, this type of mapset is always something that we are happy to put up for voting, as it provides a dynamic experience for many kinds of players, and also does a great job of keeping you entertained. If you want an awesome experience, please check this set out and give it your vote!
