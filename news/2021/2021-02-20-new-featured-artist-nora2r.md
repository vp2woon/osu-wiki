A savant of anything and everything about bass, **nora2r** joins the lineup as our latest Featured Artist!

Any music you've been listening to recently is about to be overshadowed by the intensity of [**nora2r**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/141)'s hardcore techno sound. His journey began from playing rhythm games as a kid, inspiring him to compose music and eventually make his way into some of the world's most popular rhythm games like *jubeat* and *SOUND VOLTEX*.

As of today, his sound is officially ready for osu! too.

We've gathered **16** tracks from the boss of bass, including the song most appropriate for his reputation: *B.B.K.K.B.K.K.* If you're somehow unfamiliar with this classic, watch [bze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4095562) play a map of it in the video below (and check out the other showcased maps!):

As per usual, everything above plus so much more is available now from [**nora2r**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/141). If your upstairs neighbor's been dropping bowling balls lately, mapping any of these bass-pounding songs through your speakers is the scientifically-proven best form of revenge.

You may have noticed that we've been releasing *a lot* of artists for the past few months, and we regret to inform you that... we won't be stopping any time soon. Even if you need a break, the Featured Artist train rests for no one. That said, keep up with the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for info on next week's artists!
