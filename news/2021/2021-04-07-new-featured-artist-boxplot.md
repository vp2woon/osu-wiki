Serving up his own flavour of drum & bass, **Boxplot** joins the Featured Artist lineup!

Surely anyone familiar with the drum & bass scene knows about Boston-based producer **Boxplot** (and anyone who doesn't know about him is in for a treat!). Following his debut of *Escape with the Clouds* in 2015 earning over a million listens, **Boxplot** experienced a hard drive failure that caused him to rebuild his sound from the ground up. Taking a new direction with his *Tramontane EP*, his music has become a staple for the drum & bass community.

We've pulled **10** tracks from his catalogue of work, all of which are masterpieces in their own right.

To demonstrate exactly how these songs translate to mapping, we asked [BoshyMan741](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4830687) to play a map of [*Tramontane*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1016398) created by [Alumetri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5371497) while using a fully minimalist skin. See how it turned out, and check out the other song/map samples below:

Each of these spectacular tracks (plus a bunch more) can be found [**Boxplot**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/154). Timing is done in advance, so take hold of your creative mapping tools and think outside the... uh... the toolshed. Yeah, that's definitely the best word choice.

Our Featured Artist train was built without brakes, so look forward to yet another artist announcement this Saturday and keep an eye on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) for details on anything and everything that is osu!.
