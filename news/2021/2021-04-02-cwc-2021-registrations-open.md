## How do I register?

- **[Click here to sign-up!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/28)**
- Do not create teams in advance! Teams will be formed by each country's team captain after the Registration Phase is concluded.
- Submit your registration before the **15th of April.**

Please note that you may only participate if your **osu!catch Global Ranking is #5000 or higher, and you have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months**.

If your registration passes a special check without issue, you will be placed onto the candidate list for your country. When a captain has been assigned to your country, the list will be submitted to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

*Remember that any registrations submitted after the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances — submit your registration ahead of schedule to avoid any last-minute issues.*
