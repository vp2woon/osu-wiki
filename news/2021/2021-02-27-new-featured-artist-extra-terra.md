We're proud to announce **Extra Terra** as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/143/header.jpg)

No cyberpunk future would be complete without the sounds of **Extra Terra** blasting 24/7. Despite only producing music for a few years, his works have made a massive impact on the cyberpunk/synthwave scene through a few album releases and continent-crossing tours.

**10** futuristic themes by **Extra Terra** are on the menu today, stretching from old to new across his entire discography. With a catalog of songs that even reach back to mainstream EDM styles, there's bound to be something for each and every mapper to soak up.

Speaking of catalog, some of these songs have already seen a bit of love from the osu! community, such as [*Spacecraft*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/712901) mapped by [Pandize](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5490937). Check out how a top player fares on this map using only mouse, or preview some of the more modern tunes below:
