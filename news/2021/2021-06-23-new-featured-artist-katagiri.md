**katagiri** breaks through the doors to the Featured Artist lineup!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/176/header.jpg)

Renowned for an endless catalogue of hardcore bootleg remixes and breakcore originals, **katagiri** is a Japanese producer and authority in their own brand of unmatched and diverse music.

Recently popularized by the multi-layered remix [*true DJ MAG top ranker's song Zenpen (katagiri Remix)*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1357624) by [Nathan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4785223), **katagiri**'s name has been yelled throughout the osu! community throughout the last few months, and we're more than happy to finally provide them with the well-deserved Featured Artist spotlight.

While most of their remixes and bootlegs are off limits for their library, we've snagged **10** tracks that boast the complex insanity that you know and love from **katagiri**. See [their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/176) for the full list!

Are you perchance one of the three people who still haven't heard **katagiri**? Give it a listen through the mode-spanning video below and the rest of these samples!

If you're reading this you're in the wrong place. [**katagiri**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/176) is where you should be, especially if you're a fan of not timing your own maps.

And that's all for now! In other news, this weekend's artist release will be the last of the month. We have something else planned next Wednesday instead, so visit the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) to either read about it or confess your love for circle clicking. Up to you.

See you this Saturday!
