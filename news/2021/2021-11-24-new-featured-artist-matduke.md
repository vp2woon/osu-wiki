**Matduke** blasts into the foreground as our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/219/header.jpg)

Hailing from the North America's winter wonderland (formally known as Canada), producer **Matduke** has been pushing the boundaries of electronic dance music ever since his 2011 debut under Monstercat. **Matduke**'s songs range anywhere from blood-pumping hardcore tracks to lighter electro-house songs, many of which feature incredible guest vocalists like *Veela*, so they'll inevitably be osu! classics some time down the line.

**10** top tier tunes are up for the taking from [**Matduke**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/219), all with pre-timed templates providing you extra time to focus on where to place your first circle (which is the hardest part of mapping, obviously).

Speaking of mapping, [Aistre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879380) and [Altai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5745865) of the Mappers' Guild have been working hard to showcase **Matduke**'s music through a beatmap of [Let It Go](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1625651). See how these two mappers handle playing their own creations, then explore the rest of **Matduke**'s music:

Step 1: choose a number between 1 and 10. Step 2: visit [**Matduke**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/219). Step 3: pick the song corresponding with your number and start mapping. Great! You have potential!

If electronic music isn't quite your style, you can luckily look forward to the hair-raising intensity of the guitar and percussion-focused artist being announced this Saturday. The [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) might have details on that. Or it might not. You'll have to figure that out for yourself.

See you in a few days!
