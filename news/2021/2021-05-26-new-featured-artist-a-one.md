We're proud to introduce the Touhou Eurobeat superstar **A-One** to the Featured Artist roster!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/168/header.jpg)

Spinning Touhou music in a not-so-conventional direction, **A-One** is the circle behind a handful of osu! classics. With contribution from doujin vocalist legends like *Hanatan*, *ayaponzu\**, *Nanahira*, and a whole ton of others, **A-One**'s music is bound to resonate with anyone's idea of a traditional "osu! sound".

Given how synonymous their music is with the vintage days of osu!, we're proud to officially unveil **22** blood-pumping tracks on [**A-One**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/168)!

Don't feel too bad if you don't actually recognize **A-One**'s name. Throughout osu!, most people refer to their songs by their vocalists' names, like the classic [*Shihori - Magic Girl !!*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/53519) hosted by [Frostmourne](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/199669). In case you weren't around at the time, relive the moment [Azer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578) became a magic girl through the video below, or check out all these other unforgettable maps:

Considering the variety of vocalists in this collection, we super strongly encourage you to check out [**A-One**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/168) to see if there's a song you're interested in mapping. And we recommend you do that with the rest of our Featured Artists too, obviously. Get out of here.

Featured Artist fun fact: some of our earliest artist announcements included multiple artists at once. Maybe we'll try doing that again to get through the backlog faster, but for now you can be sure that you'll see another insanely talented artist coming on Saturday. The [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) has the details (and much more), so do what you will with that info.

See you in a few days!
