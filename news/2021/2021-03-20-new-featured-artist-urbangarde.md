We're off into the unknown with our latest Featured Artist, **URBANGARDE**!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/149/header.jpg)

Putting their own spin on avant-garde indie pop is the Japanese trio behind **URBANGARDE**. With over a dozen album releases and a full multimedia collection of works sporting their distinctly outlandish style, this circle is an artisan of a their own never-before-seen musical craft.

We've snagged **6** tracks from their *AVANTDEMIC* album, each presenting a different mapping challenge from the last.

**URBANGARDE** is a relatively new name to the osu! scene, so we super strongly recommend watching [h i f u](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11843685) struggle to play a map of *URBANGARDE - BAERUNA* using a skin with blinding levels of brightness. If you're keen on keeping your eyesight, the other song previews could prove useful instead:
