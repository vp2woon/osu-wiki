**DJ Raisei** steps up to bat as our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/204/header.jpg)

On today's episode of *osu!'s Got Talent*, Japanese producer and [6-digit osu! player **DJ Raisei**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9892920) proves without a shadow of a doubt that osu! players are actually good at something other than clicking circles. Filled with every aspect of speed, emotion, and insanity, **DJ Raisei**'s soundscape is a paradise for the tech mapping world that you really wouldn't want to miss.

**10** of these incredible tracks are up for grabs from [**DJ Raisei**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/204), each sporting a unique form of complexity that begs for beatmaps across the difficulty and creativity spectrums.

[Realazy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/918297)'s massive mapset of [*ISOMERZ (DJ Raisei + seatrus) - Symmetric*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1381824) with guest difficulties from 8 different mappers showcases exactly what we're talking about. Explore that through the video and check out the rest of the songs below:

There are two things connecting all of these songs:

1. They're available on [**DJ Raisei**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/204) with pre-timed beatmap templates.
2. They're awesome.

If that isn't enough reason to open the editor and begin your map, we'll have to fire everyone from osu!'s non-existent marketing team. Say goodbye or start mapping already.

And that's all for now! Next week's Featured Artist announcements will be focused on CAPITAL LETTERS. Don't ask why. We won't tell. We'll publish all the details on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) though, so keep a finger on that.

See you on Wednesday!
