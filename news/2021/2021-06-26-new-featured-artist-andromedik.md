Drum and Bass legend **Andromedik** steps on stage as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/177/header.jpg)

Anyone familiar with the Drum and Bass scene is aware of Belgian producer **Andromedik**. Continuously growing year after year, he's the creator behind countless energetic and mood-rich tracks that got him recognized for his quick improvement through the *World's Best Newcomer* prize in 2019's Drum and Bass Arena Awards.

**15** tracks are up for grabs from [**Andromedik**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/177), all sporting a classic 174BPM and the quintissential liquid Drum and Bass feel.

Words can't describe music nor how well **Andromedik** fits osu! mapping, so take a look at [BOUYAAA](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/405449)'s fancy rendition of [*Andromedik x Itro x Polygon - Fly*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1470255) with even fancier approach circles in the video below!

Need more? [**Andromedik**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/177) has it. And even though you probably don't need it for these songs, they're all pre-timed too!

Looking forward to the new artist announcement next Wednesday? Too bad. We're instead announcing some new tracks from our current Featured Artists! Spam F5 on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) for more info on that and we'll see you next week!
