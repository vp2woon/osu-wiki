This festive time of year is all about appreciating one another, so why not share the love with some of your favourite beatmaps too?

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)

To those who need a reminder, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#loved). All of the maps are chosen by the Loved Captains of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! You can read more about this project on the wiki page!

As usual, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the November votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

[Rita - dorchadas](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/686649#osu) by [rrtyui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/352328)\
120 BPM, 1:47 | 5.54★\
*description written by [kotkeone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

Winner of [OJBC 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/589479) and made by one of the greatest to bless the game, *dorchadas* mapped by rrtyui is if nothing else, beautifully crafted.

The combination a notable song, a funny little slider, and a well-made map has allowed the popularity to grow throughout the years. At 120 BPM, \~5.7 stars and nearly 2 minutes of length, the map consists of a fun dance between flowing sliders and ever-changing circle spacing. Nothing can describe the whole map in a single paragraph, so have fun and enjoy it yourself!

162 BPM, 4:52 | 7.24★\
*description written by [kotkeone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

Nattu vs. Ciyus Miapah, a collab which has produced many popular and difficult maps, yet has another coming from the grave to join the Loved category.

*Improvisation Colosseum* fits that mold and does even more. This 162 BPM, \~7.2\* map is a mix between cut spaced alt, speedy aim, finger control, and everything in between. During the 5 whole minutes, you'll be challenged by those skills relentlessly, with some down sections requiring subskills of their own.

I believe that this map will find a place in the Loved section, and becomes Nattu's 10th loved map to boot!

166 BPM, 3:38 | 8.17★\
*description written by [kotkeone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

Made for the [Banger Bonanza Grand Finals](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1282642) and from the amazing rhythm game Rhythm Heaven, this rendition of Remix 10 in osu! uses sliders in many creative ways to recreate the feeling from the game. Along with a storyboard and video footage from the game itself, you act out the actions shown in the game, whether that be smacking away spiders or flipping books. Whatever it be, Sinnoh has created a enjoyable experience which I urge you to practice and master!

[kors k feat. Sunao Yoshikawa - 7 Colors](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/724859#osu) by [Angel Arrow](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1970239)\
156 BPM, 1:36 | 6.49★\
*description written by [kotkeone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

A newcomer to the Loved category, and with many amazing maps in the graveyard over the years, Angel Arrow makes their debut with *7 Colors*!

Sitting at 156 BPM and \~6.3 stars, this map requires agility and flow aim in order to hit the many spaced patterns throughout. Gathering intensity during the short runtime of 1.5 minutes, it explodes in the finale with a cute 7-slider. I hope this map brings plenty of joy with its simple yet fun style, and finds a great home in the Loved section!

[PERTURBATOR - She Moves Like A Knife](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1407294#osu) by [GranDSenpai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3997580)\
155 BPM, 4:00 | 6.86★, 7.05★\
*description written by [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050)*

If you want a demonstration on how extended, high-spacing jump patterns are underweighted by the pp and star rating systems, look no further than any of GranDSenpai's maps. With a plethora of \~200 BPM screen-wide jump maps, consistent in difficulty, if you want an isolated setting to train your wide jump reading or your aim control, he's your guy.

This map, however, is the map to top them all.

Sitting at just about 7 stars (below 7 stars pre-rework), and clocking in at a blisteringly fast 155 BPM, if you thought you were competent at the aim skillset, just you wait until you've played this map. Awkward patterns, linear patterns and slider-leniency-abusing jumps topped off with the aim control needed to throw your cursor across your screen and not wobble off the circles when you get to the triple on the other side, this is arguably (and in my opinion definitely) even harder than his other currently loved map, despite being around 30 BPM slower!

Being possibly the purest way to see who trumps who in the aim game, give this map a shot and see how sharp your movement is!

[Mitani Nana - Inochi Mijikashi Koiseyo Otome](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/125511#osu) by [Skystar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/873961)\
220 BPM, 3:27 | 6.23★\
*description written by [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983)*

There are few mappers as well regarded as Skystar. They have created so many iconic beatmaps since their first ranked map in 2012, and their style has influenced many mappers since. We even saw a [recently uploaded set](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1579180) from Skystar hit ranked this month, their first in almost two years!

*Inochi Mijikashi Koiseyo Otome* has been a fan favorite for many years. It is a high-speed map that is full of tough anti-aim patterns — jumps that violently change from high to low spacing, from one note to another. Combine those with a BPM of 220, and a lower approach rate of AR 9, and the end result will seriously test your snapping ability. Once you get the hang of it though, this map is a very rewarding map to combo through, and a ton of fun to execute.

This map is particularly infamous within the tournament scene, especially before the era of custom mapping for tournament play. Its difficulty settings, fast tempo, and mapping style gives it great properties as a competitive awkward aim map. Many players, including myself, were first introduced to this through its presence in a mappool.

With Skystar's return to the ranked section with their own set this month, perhaps it is time to introduce this tournament favorite to Loved too!

[ABBA - Thank You for the Music](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/42637#osu) by [Larto](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12328)\
100 BPM, 3:35 | 2.26★, 2.40★, 3.31★\
*description written by [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983)*

For the final Loved nomination for the osu! mode of 2021, here is something very sentimental.

Larto was one of the most dedicated mappers and modders between 2008 to 2012, but before he moved on from the game, he uploaded this set. He used the appropriately titled *Thank You for the Music* by ABBA for the song, as this map was created as a thank you note to numerous people in the community, and as a tribute to all of his ranked maps.

It features a storyboard running in the background through his ninety-nine ranked sets in order, as well as the name of each and every community member who he wished to thank — there are a lot of names! The map itself is a laid back and simple three-difficulty pack, but with the flair of the old style. It is mapped in his usual go-to way, chock-full of symmetry and linear aim patterns. It sticks very closely to the vocals, and has many similarities to the maps found in the Ouendan series of games.

This set is Larto's last osu! contribution to date, and it was never pushed for ranked. It serves as an epilogue to his career as one of the key creators and curators of the day, and if you agree with my nomination of this map, it would round off one hundred uploaded Larto maps with a scoreboard.

I was very active in the mapping community around the time that he was, and I am thankful to be one of the names in this map's storyboard. The holiday season is a time where we often show gratitude for what we have, and this wholesome set certainly captures the spirit of that. Thank you for the music!

*description written by [Gamelan4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9856910)*

*Kano - Sukisuki Zecchoushou* is an extremely famous song in the osu community, and out of dozens of taiko maps this song has, asuasu_yura's version is by far the most played and loved, being a common pick in multiplayer lobbies and just overall a map with great replay value. Featuring engaging and straightforward patterns and overall structure, this map is very friendly to less experienced players despite what the star rating says, so you should absolutely give it a try if you haven't yet!

*Kobaryo vs. Camellia - Villain Virus* made by shinchikuhome, is a famous map in the taiko community. It is often played by top players and others. The high difficulty and high BPM make it a very challenging map for even the most skilled players! Especially at the end of the map, the most difficult part, you will find out how scary this map really is. Please play it and see for yourself!

*description written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

Gimmick picks are usually very well received by the community as these are often quite crazy and bring a fun twist to the usual taiko gameplay, with weird interactions between objects that end up being just as fun as it is chaotic.

*inabakumori - Lagtrain* certainly isn't an exception to the rule, and although Gamelan4 made it a lot milder than what you would expect, it still serves as a introductory map for people wanting to learn the reaction skills needed for the usual gimmick maps. With very reactable, well-introduced gimmicks that leave very little to memory aside from the 0 BPM sections, it will for sure be a nice highway into the gimmick world. Enjoy!

It's been a while since people started making gimmicks with bar lines. They were mostly used as gimmick hinting element, but osu!taiko people discovered a new usage of the bar line ⁠— they started using it as visual effect!

Grape_Tea's *Chroma - lost found melody* has the most gorgeous bar-line effects of all time! Since it got showcased on the [Slider Velocity Showdown](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1361851) mapping contest, this map has been receiving hype throughout the community with its quality chart, showing off that osu!taiko beatmaps can be made this beautiful. Please try this beatmap if you haven't, because not playing a map this cool is just a loss as a taiko player!

Lets relax a bit from those extreme gimmick maps and rapid speed maps.

*Mia REGINA - I got it! (slax remix)* by maguro869 and hoku is a map most taiko players will know as one of maguro's classics. A simple, yet challenging map with an amazing pace throughout the entire map because of some great improvisation to keep the flow going. This map is a perfect example of an all-round well-made map.

Featuring mechanics from small streams to 1/6 and 1/4 patterns, and being quite friendly for most mods, it's clear to see why this map would be exciting for play for a big audience. With that being said, I hope many of you will enjoy playing this masterpiece.

280 BPM, 3:27 | 7.57★\
*description written by [Horiiizon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8071438)*

*Sainou Shredder* is another ll-oscar map in his signature style as a part of his signature series *ll-taiko Sp*. These maps all consist of very high BPM and mostly 1/4 overmapping. *Sainou Shredder* has the **lowest** BPM for an ll-oscar map put up for Loved. This is not to say the map is by any means slow, because it is an intense 280 BPM from start to finish with only a few brief moments in the entire map to rest.

Hopefully this map is enjoyed by ll-taiko Sp. fans and those who may struggle to keep up with higher BPM maps or other ll-taiko Sp. maps like [Qronostasis](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/399965) or [Scarlet Rose](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/195238) alike!

*WOULD AMENPUNK IS IMPRESSED?* by Mew is a map many of you will recognise, most notably because it was used as a NM5 pick in the Semifinals of TWC2019 as well as being featured in several other tournaments.

Despite having no flashy SVs or unusual snappings, *WOULD AMENPUNK IS IMPRESSED?* manages to stand out as a very fun, challenging and unique map which is a testament to how well mapped it is! The most challenging part of *WOULD AMENPUNK IS IMPRESSED?* is definitely the almost 200-note-long stream roughly half way through the map which has various 1/6 patterns in it. *Hopefully You is Impressed?!*

Let's start off with a nice little winter-themed pick to warm you all up for the cold! *Omoi - Snow Drive* needs very little introduction, as the song is very popular amongst all gamemodes, including catch!

This map has a fast-paced song with a BPM of 224, no breaks and consists of a total of three difficulties: a single lower difficulty and two higher difficulty maps. While all difficulties are relatively simple for their star rating, they should at least still give you some trouble getting a full combo due to the song being quite long and as mentioned before, no breaks!

Give any of the difficulties a go, with the variety of approach rates between the difficulties, there should be at least one you should enjoy!

The map contains a lot of anti-flow jumps, zoom sliders with hyperdashes and stair patterns, yet Bunnrei proves once again that they are able to make them enjoyable.

*description written by [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)*

Del is one of those players that mapped a lot but never really tried hard enough to get their maps ranked, leaving a lot of hidden gems behind that remain untouched. *Xevel* is one of those.

The difficulty of this map is rather high because of the unusual style of the map. Even though it utilizes patterns you would also see in one or the other ranked map, they are placed in a way that makes catching them difficult. Doing good on this map requires consistency, good reading and good catcher control. Certainly a map for people that are on another level.

We are a little late with this map being put up to the Loved voting, but better late than never!

I personally didn't know any of Tachibana Gekka maps, so when I saw this map I was pleasantly surprised by how it was mapped. The map is short, the BPM is fast and the mapping style is very clean. It switches between a very normal-style map, to bursts when the music calls for it and then goes back around to the normal style. The changes blend well together, making it a very well rounded map.

Sutavv making their first appearance in the Loved category and it is quite an entrance if I have to say so myself.

- Star rating over 10: check
- A song by ExileLord: check

Now with these two parameters you can already guess what is coming: hyperwalks! If you like to be precise in your movement, without having to worry too much about holding and letting go of your dash key, then you have arrived at the perfect map for you!

This is a very fast-paced but short song with a lot of hyperwalks all over the place and a couple of patterns in between that are not hyperwalks to throw you off your game just a little bit. Are you able to hold a combo and not die in the middle of the map because you missed a hyperwalk?

This one dates back to the MWC 2018 Finals and was one of the toughest nuts to crack for competitors at the time. Do you have what it takes to clear this challenge?

There's almost no need to introduce Ciel anymore: if you are any familiar with [lost found melody](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1051052) or the more recent [true DJ MAG top ranker's song Zenpen](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1569250), you know how hard SVs can get. You know the pain of even getting a pass, an A, let alone an S on those maps. But you know there are people in the world with such prowess, they have made themselves known. Perhaps such powers belong to you as well?

Cast your vote and find out how far players, and maybe even you yourself, can push the leaderboards!

Whether you were someone who stumbled upon this without knowing what even a Dan is *(which I commend you for, you're doing great)*, or someone who discovered Seiryuu's selection of jack maps after seeing *ceeeertain charts inside* in other courses, it is undeniable that both types of players ended up liking the pack to the point it became quite a popular collection!

The vast selection of songs (and patterns believe it or not) is very welcoming. It's not a stretch to say that there's no map alike, and that each chart holds a uniqueness to it that's not attributable by any other one chart in the pack. Point is: there is going to be a chart for everyone. Maybe you enjoy more anchor-y patterns. Perhaps you want to try your luck with more dense stuff. Alternatively, you can always try something faster than the rest. The choice is yours to make.

With this said, words alone cannot fully enclose what players will find in this collection. So we encourage you to try them all out and draw your own conclusion. Enjoy!

*description written by [Penguinosity](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10235296)*

CrewK makes their first entry to the Loved votings, with their great chordjack map of *Yatsume Ana*!

CrewK has built up quite the reputation as a player over the years, with their unparalleled abilities in playing SV, and just as a talented all-rounded player. Aside from that though, many people have come to enjoy the maps that they've put out over the years, most of it being *Yatsume Ana* as it seems.

The chart comes in at about 3.5 minutes of playtime, and once it starts, it never stops. This is a full-blown stamina map that sees no breaks in anything except for some decreased layering where it fits the song. One such place being a lot of the sections outside of the song's chorus, where although the density may be lesser in comparison, you will still be constantly coordinating hands, quads, and an abundant amount of triple anchors.

As for the chorus though, it's deceptively brutal. At 130 BPM which is no laughable speed for CJ, the two kiai times are a barrage of hands on at least every half measure, constant quads, and plenty of anchors. The second kiai specifically I would like to mention is particularly brutal, as it lasts pretty much an entire minute, and switches up to include some anchors that last up to 5 notes.

This chart has come to be enjoyed by a great deal of jack players, and it's easy to see why. Even some of the most talented jack players should have their skills tested, and it will all be to this beautifully serene track.

As always we're glad to bring a new face to Loved, and especially one who we have been waiting for as long as CrewK, someone who truly deserves to have their works recognized in this manner. Make sure all of you show your appreciation and support by casting your vote!

\_underjoy makes another appearance to the Loved section with his hellish marathon of *Naruto RMX*!

Made in late 2018, this three-year-old map holds up today as being an absolutely brutal test of endurance. At nearly 9 minutes in length, you will receive one, and only one break throughout the runtime. This map is nothing but jumpstreams, handstreams, splittrills, and all kinds of eighth bursts which is what's given this map the reputation that it rightfully deserves.

This isn't the type of thing that most people would play for fun. This is the type of chart that people play when they're looking to give themselves some serious training, and possibly pain.

Patterning of this kind at 238 BPM is brutal enough, but UJ decided that to meet the demands of some of the VSRG community's most physically oriented players today, rates needed to be added. From 1.0 up to 1.3, there's something here that should more than satiate the endurance test desire that we know those kinds of players are looking for.

Fantastic job to our own \_underjoy as always for providing the huge variety of maps that he always does, and best of luck to all of you who dare to play this map, and remember everyone...

**don't pause** :)

Whatever the reason might be, it does not excuse the fact that this is Ska's debut in the Loved section with one of their most recognizable and enjoyable files out there! The chart itself is really fun. For those looking for both a speedy, tiresome, and technical challenge, here's a good contender for that. And how could we forget about rates, in case you think your arms are still usable moving up the rates.

Definitely a long overdue gem, a really good one some might even add, so give a round of applause to Ska, and preorder *Bayonetta III* while you're at it, will ya?

Do you want even more stamina gaming? This wave definitely delivers some long-awaited handstream classics, as we decided to bundle up a few of the famous \[Crz\]Rachel Ariabl'eyeS charts and nominate them!

This pack contains charts that have already gathered a decent reputation on their own. That includes Kegare Naki Bara Juuji, Senkou o Furea, Shuuen no Kane, Sougetsu Oratorio, Romanesque Romancia and Rin — all of them on 1.0 and 1.1 rate (due to mappack limitations we couldn't include more — the maps are already pretty fast on their own though!). All of them are centered around dense, neverending handstreams at respectable speeds that, albeit very comfortable, are designed to burn out the last drop of your stamina.

What's better than training your stamina to the angelic voices of Ariabl'eyeS' gothic metal vocalists? Voting for the mappack :)

At long last. 2018 was the year of hi19hi19's appearance in the Loved scene, and if I might have the pleasure to say it, that was both well deserved and not sufficient. They truly are a *staple* in the charting scene. Even when we thought they would simply end after their long-lasting mapping career, they came back with the solid release of [hi19hi19 Pack 6](https://www.flashflashrevolution.com/vbz/showthread.php?t=153541) (even though it is safe to assume [this](https://www.flashflashrevolution.com/vbz/showthread.php?t=144562) was a funnier entry).

However, today we're not here to look at their new entries that, while solid, do not hold the same power as their older, more recognizable charts. and this is why we've decided to give a warm welcome back to hi19hi19 with [Terminal 11 - Staple on Smile](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1309129)!

The multitude of versions this chart has had during all the years since its inception is insurmountable. And despite all that, this has managed to be one of the most recognizable ones by then thus far. Its technical approach stays true to hi19's nature while making justice to Terminal 11.

Many older players are now going to be able to relieve a figment of hi19's second to last entry of their packs. And while small, it undoubtedly is something valuable to now have the chance to love, for everyone to forever experience.

*Victorious Journey* is here! This gauntlet of an LN map is a collaborative effort between Kamuy, AKA Drago, as well as Raveille. At just under 4 minutes in change, you will not get a moment to breathe with this chart.

From one section to the next, the map does its best to keep you under an immense amount of pressure. The two mappers here split the workload pretty much down the middle, with the sections constantly swapping between each other, and the two joining together for the climactic preview point near halfway in.

As I first mentioned, this chart is LN oriented through and through. Your abilities to manage ample amounts of finger-independent and stressful release patterning is put to the test throughout the whole runtime. To break the map down into sections, the first third provides some good introductory patterns to prepare you for what's to come. The first very "calm" section of the song throws a bit of a curveball to what most would expect, and decides to make use of full inverse and anchor long notes (as well as the other calm breakdown later on).

After that, you're thrown into LN flams with staggered releases, all while trying to coordinate some longer LNs in between. This then leads into the joint section between Kamuy and Raveille, where the combined efforts put together some damn brutal patterns that would put even some of the most seasoned LN players to the test. Lots of one-handed patterns including longjacks, and of course LNs, that make for what many would probably consider the most difficult section of the chart.

Leading from that, you get another calmer inverse bit, leading into the final leg where the mappers do most of what was done previously, but tastefully changed up to fit the song and to also keep players engaged.

We're glad to bring this challenging long note map to the votings, and of course the first nomination from Kamuy, as well as a seasoned name like Raveille. Great job to the both of them on this map, and we hope you all enjoy it as much as we do!

Saying that this map is infamous would be a clear understatement. It doesn't matter whether you've personally experienced the file during its inception when it was first released in [ATTang's Bad Files](https://etternaonline.com/pack/13), or you're someone who had to endure it in a certain 4-map marathon course. The fact of the matter is the fame that ATTang was able to attain from crafting this "Masterpiece"!

A truly unforgiving file, and a challenge for those willing to look for one. Saying that this will be testing your speed is not enough, as for those looking for their own perdition, rates will officially be included with the map's release.

It has been a while since we've all got to experience one of their files, their last contribution being [Yuyoyuppe - Palette - GAMMA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/409429#mania/888777) (not counting their vibro charts that is), which will make this return quite special.

And that about wraps it up! It's time to prove who can clear beyond 96% atop the leaderboards. Have fun\~

Coming straight from 2017, this one has been quite well known for being advisable for players looking to improve their stamina: with rates starting at 168 BPM and peaking at 235 BPM, even intermediate players can find good training ground on this almost 6-minute long relentless onslaught of jumpstream and handstream patterns.

Sometimes a sparkling gem appears in the mapping community and JuHaa's charts gathered a fair bit of attention recently. Their mapping prowess and style is captivating and efficient, and *PURE SILVER* is a prime example of JuHaa's abilities.

*PURE SILVER* is defined by its simplicity, with its premise well signaled throughout the chart. Uneven LNs combined with LN chords are accompanied by regular chords and streams that follow the keysounds of the song. The consistency and flow of this map are noticeable at a first glance and stand out — everything feels just in the place it belongs to. Both 4K and 7K difficulties are mapped similarly, with the 7K encapsulating the song even better.

We're more than pleased to give JuHaa's *PURE SILVER* a spotlight. Cast a vote and check out their other maps too!

For this round, spoonguy is returning with his chart of *Vend*!

*Vend* is filled with lots of anchor-y chord usage as many would expect, with a dense climax for the chorus. There are two checkpoints to pass this chart, the first chorus section starts mainly with triple minijacks, and some relatively tame 3-chord-jacks which will give your finger some leniency. The chorus section proceeding them is what to watch for, which features endless 4-chord jacks that are tastefully mapped in pitch relevance with the music — this bit will truly test your stamina.

This is a well-done and difficult map, which given how rare 7K chordjack charts have been throughout mania's history, something like this is always nice to see. The stylish and difficult chord usage and competitive patterning of this set makes it a great candidate for the Loved section. Great work to spoonguy, and make sure you show your support by voting!

This huge mapset has guest diffs from many well-known ranked mappers such as Turrim, Wonki, Shima Rin and Murumoo. These difficulties are getting increasingly dense and contain mostly non-intrusive LNs.

Most of the patterns are based on stairs, which can become quite tight due to high bpm. There's also lots of repetition due to the nature of the song. After the "blackout", the player is met with the climax part, featuring short LN chordstreams that end with a notable burst section. The patterns used are comfy but rather distinct, so pay attention!

Give a warm welcome to Jakads and enjoy another big mapset in the Loved selection!

Us 7K captains are bringing you another huge set, *Mach space journey* by yahweh! yahweh has been actively mapping and playing for several years at this point and they're particularly well known in the quaver community, so we're glad to finally bring you all his first nomination.

The charts in *Mach space journey* are mainly focused in speed stream patterning, with a wide range of difficulties which gives this set a good spread of approachability for all kinds of 7K players.

Mainly focusing on the top two difficulties, the map is loaded with chordstreams, and an incredibly dense climax. As daunting as that sounds though, all of the diffs on this set including the top two provide numerous breaks in the density, which will really help lift the stamina burden that 223 BPM patterns like this would normally bring. All of the sections are straightforward, well-executed, and of course fun for any player looking to challenge themselves on something this fast.

That's all that I can really say for this, just a fun set and to such an energetic song. Great job to yahweh, we are happy to finally bring you their first Loved nomination!

Noodle enthusiasts will warmly welcome this set. Are you a fan of chill Japanese music and complicated long note patterns? If you answered 'yes' to at least one of these questions, *Natsukoi* by Otokaze is for you!

Difficulties by Nananana feature rather complex and visually aesthetic LNs accompanied by, counterintuitively, very short long notes that require quick taps to preserve accuracy. Luckily, the OD is rather low to accomodate for that.

The LN full ver. is comprised of full inverse patterning that requires a hefty amount of LN control to execute. To spice things up even further, ccouy123's guest diff introduces a whole lot of shields, that make the chart notoriously hard despite its low BPM.

*Natsukoi* is a neatly executed map that's been there for some time, and we're confidently nominating it for Project Loved!

You know this map. You probably have mixed feelings about it. That's okay. Embrace it. *Crazy Tek* from Kim_GodSSI is one of these maps that are popular for just how infamous they are. Yet, there's a distinct aura about them that makes them strangely enjoyable to play.

The original UHD difficulty is pretty much reserved for the top 7K players. Incredibly dense LN chordstreams with menacing jack bursts make even passing this crazy map a challenge — that's why it was included in the old LN Azimuth Dan.

Apparently Kim_GodSSI decided that this isn't enough and made an even harder 2021 difficulty. How anyone treats *Crazy Tek* as a "not hard enough" map is a mystery, but anyway here we are. The downrates were added to make both of these diffs are least somewhat more accessible for players who are on their ET journey.

This is a controversial pick, but this map is so well known that we decided the time for *Crazy Tek* has come. Good luck!

We dug this one all the way back from 2015: while at the time, competition on the keysets was up in the air, contemporary players may find renewed interest in those unconventional settings, just as they did for the short and basic 2-key difficulty of [*Chilli Daddy*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1236952#mania/2571107). Out of sheer coincidence, that mapset comes from Nivrad00 who is also the one who brought us this mappack right here!
