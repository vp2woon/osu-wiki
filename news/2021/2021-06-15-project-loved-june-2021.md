Only the \[Marathon\] difficulty is being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050)*

On the morning of Thursday, 18 July 2019, Kyoto Animation's Studio 1 building suffered an attack on an unprecedented scale. 36 lives were lost, along with countless hours of work. This mapset was uploaded as a direct tribute to the amazing productions related to the company, as well as to the incredibly talented people involved in their creation. It features 30 minutes of some well known songs from their shows, and as you can see from the amount of mappers involved, was a real community effort.

It may never have made it to the Ranked section, but it still has a potential home in Loved.

*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

Yusomi has created yet another popular mapset, consisting of 190 BPM, 7-star jumps, spaced bursts, and streams.

*Zen Zen Zense* keeps the steam up, almost never falling behind in difficulty. The cross screen jumps never stay in consistent linear patterns, falling into star and triangle patterns instead, and the multiple spaced streams and bursts help ramp the difficulty to keep your aim on check. The mapset has both an AR 9.5 and AR 10 difficulty, graciously letting you pick your preference. I am confident you'll enjoy this classic jump map while your cursor shoots across the screen like a comet of fate.

*description written by [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050)*

Seamob has seemingly come out of nowhere in the last year, but has quickly become a known name for mapping comfortable and aesthetic flow aim to some smooth soundtracks. This one is no exception. 200 BPM flow aim patterns for 5 minutes straight await you - there's barely a single beat that isn't mapped. The song, lullaby, is also extremely catchy, and you'll find yourself coming back to play this far more than you'd like to admit. An all around top tier experience, make sure you don't pass this one by.

This 7-minute marathon hits every itch of engaging, high-star tech gameplay. 8.60 stars, 220+ BPM, and some of the most satisfying rhythms and patterns I've ever seen, this map is the perfect fit to challenge the absolute best of the best. No matter how much of an osu! legend you might be, if you want a challenge, this map will be waiting for you.

It's one thing to discover a song like this and appreciate the comedy gold, and it's another to put in the effort to map the whole thing. The two difficulties in this mapset are 3 and 4 stars, making it accessible to just about anyone. This one's for all those late nights playing multiplayer with friends where you're not sure what to pick.

*description written by [POCARI SWEAT](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5082685)*

1/6 patterns are one of the key skills needed to play osu!taiko. But where can we practice it? This map has the answer.

Konpaku Sariel's *1/6 Practice Pack 1* is a package of 20 beatmaps containing various decently mapped 1/6 patterns, especially for players wanting to familiarize themselves with the idea. These difficulties are designed as practice maps so they're generally very slow and easy to understand. If you're already familiar with 1/6 patterns, there are higher level difficulties you can try. Whether you're a 1/6 beginner or an expert, this beatmap will pose a decent challenge to help expand upon a valuable skillset.

All things considered, Teo is already such a good song so having katagiri remixing it in *Never to Fade Away*... mmm, delicious.

In Dark Sky makes sure the map's polish keeps pace with the song, all while remaining satisfying to play and easy to read - really quite the rare delicacy nowadays! Take a chance to experience such a flowy, streamy map and maybe with your help, it can stick around in Loved too. Enjoy!

While KinomiCandy is already well known for his Future Bass maps, with KitajimaYN in the mix we've got a ourselves a beatmap containing the classic long streams and entry-level 1/6 patterns that KinomiCandy's is known for, while also having the really high quality structure expected from KitajimaYN, resulting in one fun map that we're sure players around the 5 star level and mod hunters will enjoy. Give this one a try!

We often feature tons of tech maps that are on the higher end when it comes to BPM and they sure are challenging reading tongue twisters but, what about low BPM? Well, it turns out they can be as challenging to read as well!

*Baroque* mapped by Quibby is a 164 BPM tech map that has frequent time divisor changes to make the players stay on their toes if they want to get perfect accuracy, as well as nass style patterning featuring flurries of 1/6 and 1/8 patterns when things get serious, making for one of the slowest 8\* maps that still remains quite good in terms of beatmap quality overall, so we're sure you'll find this one pretty fun to play.

*description written by [X a v y](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3738344)*

*Onegai Muscle* by hoku manages to hit a perfect level of density in which it is not considered a stream only map yet it manages to be challenging and engaging. The map remains simple, however it still manages to create very well flowing patterns which makes for the possibility of using mods such as Hidden or HardRock for practicing using mods. The song itself, bootlegged by 7_7, somehow makes the already very well received song sound even more hyped with the hardcore beats. I'm sure most players around an advanced level will enjoy this beatmap.

Camellia feat. Nanahira has been a favorite combination of the osu! community for a long time, and Shamirin_mzk delivers a very well constructed map for such their song of *Mathematics MA+MA = Magic!*. This map delivers a novel experience compared to those in Ranked, as the mapper uses his very distinct gimmick style to insert creative gimmicks to emphasize on the heavy beats, which makes every section of the map unique in its own way. This makes for an engaging experience while playing such a beatmap, and you should try it out if you enjoy gimmick styled beatmaps!

For some of the older players in the game this map will be a blast from the past. This was picked a lot back in the day in multiplayer lobbies, you really couldn't go a day without playing it.

When you see a xi song, you can already somewhat expect that it'll be a stream map. And you guessed it right, it is a stream map!\
However it is not one of the usual stream maps you see nowadays, this map has a bunch of streams that require you to zigzag very precisely in order to catch the streams. Now of course you can also plate walk them, but where is the fun in that, right?\
And of course, it being an old map, it obviously has quite a few stairs here and there. In my opinion they are impossible to catch (haha) but I'd love to be proven otherwise by some legendary player(s)!

*Aleph-0* is as wild as his other submitted maps, showcasing stacked notes, brutal hyperchains and interesting spinner gimmicks. No description would be enough to depict how creative and diverse the map itself and its patterns are. Such map would be a pleasant for a lot of top players who seek for more challenges. If you're a top-level player or a fan of gimmicky sets, definitely make sure to check this one out.

I think there is hardly anyone actively playing this game that has never heard of Spectator before - a true master in mapping with all the experience you could ever ask for.

*Oni Kanojo* however, is a map that is quite hard to pinpoint. It does certainly feel like an older map (which makes sense as it was submitted in 2016) but at the same time it is missing features which other old maps have. On one hand, most of the map is pretty straight-forward and you don't have to suffer through a variety of brutal edge dashes. On the other hand, it has a lot of patterns that you almost never see nowadays.

Most of the challenge of the map is pretty much being consistent with the hyperdashes it throws at you and having enough catcher control to do the triplets. Certainly not the easiest map to FC, but very much doable by a lot of players. A vocaloid classic and a catch mapping classic, what else would you want?

Good news everyone! We have another first-timer in this round of Loved nominations! Introducing Sorceress with their map *All I wanna do is touch your power points*.

Now I understand that 2020 was not truly a year for the books for most people, but if there is anything that would make someone nostalgic about 2020, it would be the osu!catch World Cup, right?! This map was part of that fun experience, being a nomod map in the first finals week. Because of that, it obviously is a fairly tough map (although not as hard as some of the 2021 CWC maps (good ol' times hey)). It is very wiggly and meant for players on the higher-end of the skill spectrum. Don't let this fact intimidate you though, as it is very fun to play, with a song backing it up that is weirdly catchy despite its rather peculiar style.

So yeah, all I wanna do is coax you into downloading this map, have you try it out, and then have you vote on whether you want to see this Loved or not (and perhaps I'll touch your power points while I'm at it, muahaha)!

*description written by [Penguinosity](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10235296)*

*We Luv Lama*, a song that needs absolutely no explanation. If you're a VSRG player living under a rock, you still know what this map is. If *We Luv Lama* was a drink, it would be Coke. If *We Luv Lama* was a food, it would be pizza. If *We Luv Lama* was a person, uh... it would be a pretty famous person. Flattery aside, there's nothing left to be said that hasn't been said before about one of, if not IcyWorld's most iconic chart to date.

Being a decade old at this point, *We Luv Lama* has given players of all ranges a run for their money in terms of a pure test of stamina and physical abilities over the years. The 29 here is an absolute splittrill hell-fest that has truly stood the test of time as being a benchmark to look at for just how skillful a player is.

One big thing worth mentioning is that the last 45 seconds or so of this chart has taken so many runs over the years and absolutely crushed them into dust. The final 10 seconds specifically introduces heavy hand patterns, which on rates especially can deliver the final blow to your stamina and accuracy after enduring everything that it proceeds.

Besides this though, IcyWorld has also provided here his take on a 16, which cuts back a lot of the heavy-handedness from the 29 and opts to incorporate a lot more jumps and single streams. It's more tame in comparison, but whether you play it with or without rates it still poses its own unique challenges along with maintaining being a strong assessment of a players stamina.

There isn't a lot more that I can say here, but just know that this chart is an incredibly important and iconic piece of VSRG history, and has every right to be Loved. Show Icy your love for what he's done over the years!

A popular mapper in the Ranked section, Monheim appears with *Falling On Deaf Ears*, a bite-sized rock chart centered around jumpstreams and quick bursts.

With the base difficulty having a drain time of a mere 2:18, and only about half of that time being of significant difficulty, the map provides a very speedy and enjoyable experience for players, making it a really nice scoring file. That's not all the map has however, sporting a variety of patterns including bursts, jacks, and hand-streams in a clearly formulaic and satisfying structure. There's more to this chart than meets the eye, so please check it out and give it a vote for this month's edition of Project Loved!

The \[Un-known's Viva Happy\] and \[Un-known's Viva Happy (LN Master)\] difficulties are *not* being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [Penguinosity](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10235296)*

Let's take ourselves back to 2014 for a second here. osu!mania is still in its early years in terms of the size of its playerbase, and newcomers to the game are either coming from another VSRG, or are first-time players to games like this. The first instinct a lot of these players have is to play music that they want to hear and lo and behold Rinzler comes along and releases a full set dedicated to Nanahira music, and in the following months even comes out with a sequel to this set.

Looking at Nanahira today with hindsight, we know the legacy, and the memes, and the sheer impact that her music has brought to the rhythm game scene. Back when this first collection was released though, I would argue many players were unfamiliar and just getting introduced to her sound, and man it was a sound that A LOT of players enjoyed.

Onto this set itself though, Rinzler took a pretty safe and comfortable approach to these charts but also managed to create a good spread for the overall difficulty range with what's here. What's more though, is all of the charts they created have their own Full LN counterparts, which at the time, was a very uncommon thing to do. Long notes were a slow build for the osu!mania community before getting to where we are today, so while we can look at this now and not bat an eye, credit needs to be given that Rinzler would even bother to add these at a time where players who would play things like full inverse in 4K were very few and far between. That about covers what's going on with this set, I just want to thank Rinzler for what they've done here and for the community over the years, and I'm happy that we finally get to see something from them up for a Loved wave.

IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE WAVES, where the Loved team decides to get a bunch of absolute hood classics out for the players.

*Break* over here needs no introduction as we're sure everybody is more than familiar with it, and really the bottom line is that this chart, \*ahem\*, "gives absolutely no fucks" much like the song it's representing. There's a reason why the map is so infamous, as this is a constant onslaught of 130 BPM heavy chordjacks with a lot of quads mixed in.

Also, there are a number of funny gluts and graces to be found whether in or outside of these dense jack sections too which can be pretty tricky to manage. The cherry on top however, is the fact that the rates provided span from 0.8x speed, all the way to 1.3x. Some may argue the morality of uprating patterns like these up to 169 BPM, but I can at least say that I don't think beary was trying to kill people with this. They at least made sure that there were a few... *break* sections throughout the map. Alright, that's probably enough out of me, go ahead and vote please.

[The Algorithm - floating point (Drumcorps Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/545035#mania) by [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750) and [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707)\

*floating point (Drumcorps Remix)* is a technical 7K chart made by \_underjoy, and Shoegazer has provided their popular 4K guest difficulty here as well which is equally as technical in its own way. Both difficulties here are loaded with brutal longjacks, which can be incredibly difficult to handle especially on higher rates. Luckily, there's some breathing room for players who tire out on the jacks alone.

Focusing on the charts individually,  \_underjoy's Approximation difficulty includes some tricky SV,  relatively awkward LN coordination, and the aforementioned longjacks which ultimately leads to a ridiculously hard chart to approach. Now onto Shoegazer's difficulty, which quite a few 4K players should be familiar with, the prime focus here is really on your ability to handle some truly unfriendly jack patterns. Longjack sections aside, there's a lot more going on here just with the anchoring alone that leads to patterns being deceptively hard. They also manage to work in some tricky flams and roll sections especially in the ladder half of the map.

If you're up for the challenge, show your support to these two insane charts by giving them your vote.

Here is a quality chart for anyone who wants to challenge their skill! Nananana presents to us a well-made chart to a very unique song. The map starts out calm, but quickly picks up and is designed to test your stamina on a variety of patterns, including a lot of different bracket layering, and some tasteful LN usage that really compliments the song and rice patterns. At 135 BPM, much of what's here should feel comfortable to play for experienced 7K players, but still should give a good challenge to anyone looking for it. It's because of this map's strong structure, that we believe it really deserves a spot in the Loved section. Let's give a warm welcome to Nananana!

Nakano Yuko is prominent osu!mania mapper bringing forth many expressive charts for 7K. Uploading majority of his maps under the alias -Melon, searching would reward you with a wide range of difficult technically challenging charts paired with various artists most popular songs being used such as songs from Camellia's "Blackmagik Blazing" Album, along with Memme, xi, Lapix and more!

Alongside that in this 7K collection compiled of Nakano Yuko's most famous charts, you'll find very straightforward and fun BMS charting styles in the lower spectrum and eventually gaining more technicality in speed and stamina.

Charts like *Cyber Shaman*, *Illusionary overflowing*, *Blackmagik Blazing* are showcasing these hard stamina draining rice patterns utilizing fast chordstreams and consistent chordjacks to really challenge the player. Changing up the mapping style towards long notes on *3y3s*, *This Future*, *Erebus* are filled with Inverse, and tons of LN releases, paired with the high bpm of the songs, really test the LN mains for full combos.

This collection is showcasing little of the work Nakano Yuko has brought to the game, with 5 more collections and 2 Camellia album sets, along with countless other solo mapsets, Nakano Yuko will continue to shine throughout as a brilliant, well-known mapper.
