**Tanchiky** joins the lineup as our latest Featured Artist!

Genre-hopping Japanese producer [**Tanchiky**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/144) is surely a household name to anyone familiar with the rhythm game landscape. Widely recognized for high-intensity works in games like *maimai* and *Muse Dash*, his music is a blast of energy perfect for the upper echelons of gameplay.

As you'll hear from the **27** tracks available for mapping, his style doesn't stay in one place for long — some songs are purely instrumental, others feature guest vocalists, and some even pull from classic oriental roots.

If you're not convinced yet, a face-off between a couple of osu!'s top tier players may bring you all the mapping inspiration you need. Watch [MightyDoc](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9067591) and [SWAGGYSWAGSTER](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7813296) go head to head on [*Tanchiky - Bridge*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1378720) mapped by [NyarkoO](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6622567), or check out the other maps below:
