After their grand return just [last month](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2021-06-15-mca-ayim-2019), these two popular events are now here to catch up with the present! With newly revised categories, website quality-of-life updates, and badges now being given to the winner for **every** category, the scale of these two community titans is only growing from here. Most of these events are made by mappers for mappers, but *everyone* is welcome to check out the festivities!

## Mapper's Choice Awards 2020

In case you're not in the loop, the Mapper's Choice Awards (affectionately dubbed MCA by most people) is a voting event with multiple categories where mappers can nominate maps for various prizes and then vote on which entry they feel is the most fitting for a given category, as well as voting for the best map of the year in the Grand Award. There are a large number of categories to choose from, ranging from things like general mapping performance, most promising newcomer and much more.

**If you ranked any beatmap or storyboard during 2020, you're now invited to help the mapping community pick the best of the best!**

As in the 2019 edition, the Mapper's Choice Awards has three main stages: nomination, voting, and results. Be sure to check our schedule above to know when each stage happens!

- **Nomination:** Eligible users can submit any beatmaps/storyboards or users from 2020 they feel are deserving of recognition in their respective categories.
- **Voting:** Eligible users can vote on the pool of submitted nominations.
- **Results:** Will be based off the results of voting and feature a livestream discussing each of the top winners.

Those who win regular awards on their beatmaps or storyboards in the results will be given 2 months of supporter, and grand prize winners will receive 6 months of supporter. In addition, those who place first in any category will receive a unique **MCA 2020 badge** for their achievement. If you're not eligible to vote in MCA, your reward for following along will be getting to find out about super snazzy 2020 maps.

As of this newspost, the **nomination stage** is now open for submissions and raring to go, so if you're eligible and interested, head on over to the [MCA website](https://mca.corsace.io). Remember, if you love something enough to nominate it, be sure to come back for the voting stage to vote it into the final leaderboards too.

## A Year in Mapping 2020

If you like seeing big collections of beatmap statistics, look no further than A Year in Mapping (also known as AYIM). AYIM is a neatly bundled peek into the mapping trends and data of a given year, including interesting things like which mapper ranked the most sets, how many difficulties were ranked overall, what the most and least difficult maps of the year were and tons more interesting trivia and records for you to sink your teeth into.

AYIM has all of those covered for the beatmaps and mappers ranked in 2020. Will Sotarks lead in over 70% of the osu! user category statistics again? Only one way to find out!

Make sure to check it all out over at the [AYIM website](https://ayim.corsace.io/2020)!
