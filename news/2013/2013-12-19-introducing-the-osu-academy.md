New players often have a hard time adjusting to osu! gameplay, the editor, and even vocabulary specific to the game. Fortunately, we now have [a Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/osuacademy/videos) featuring videos that go over these points in a helpful and educational way.

This brand-new series, known as the "osu! academy", gives a comprehensive look at all aspects of osu!, from playing to mapping and everything in between. Please keep in mind that it is still a work in progress, and not everything is covered yet. However, this also means that the channel will be updating frequently, so keep an eye out for new videos!

We hope that new players will find these videos informative, and help ease the arguably steep learning curve associated with the game. If you have any questions or comments, please forward them to [ztrot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6347) \- he is the primary and almost sole owner of the osu! academy and its channel, so give him a round of applause!

You can find the osu! academy by clicking the link at the top of this news post, or by clicking **[here](https://www.youtube.com/user/osuacademy/videos)**.
