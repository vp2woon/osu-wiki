Calling all mappers! After a brief delay, the monthly beatmapping contest is back! Test your mettle against mappers from around the globe in creating the best beatmap you can to this month's theme - **Touhou**!

The song choice for this month is cYsmix ft. emii - Tear Rain. This is a relatively long cut due to the structure of the song. Even so, I would recommend against using long break sections as a rule (short ~6s breaks are fine, if used correctly).
