Without any further delay, we'd like to present the winner for the monthly beatmap contest!

It was a very close competition this time. Only a mere 7 points stood between the winner and the runner up - despite the heated competition, the judges have declared the winner for the month of September to be **[Charles445](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/85000)**!\
Congratulations, Charles; your map will be bundled with the game client, and you will receive the other prizes shortly. Let's also give a big round of applause for **[Alumetorz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1145984)**, who came in second place, nearly taking the gold!

You can review the full results [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/contestresults?c=7). We would like to thank everyone that took part in this contest, and can't wait to see more in the future!
