Calling all mappers again! It's time for another monthly beatmapping contest! Show off your mapping skills against others by creating the best beatmap you can to this month's contest song!

The song choice for this month is **Chasers - Lost**. With a total length of 3:30, the song offers various opportunities to let your creativity loose with fancy patterns and mapping techniques. You can listen to the song right here.

## Prizes

- 'Elite Mapper' title
- **Winning mapset is bundled with the osu! game client download!**

## Rules

- You must map 3 difficulties in an appropriate spread - either ENH (easy, normal and hard) or NHI (normal, hard, insane).
- Collaboration is allowed, but will only be registered under the name of the person who submitted the beatmap.
- Difficulty names must only be the name of the respective difficulty, and nothing else. No ztrot's Hard or anything like that.

The deadline for submission is **end of January**. The explicit deadline will be announced soon. No mapset submitted after that date will be accepted, so make sure you submit your entry on time!
