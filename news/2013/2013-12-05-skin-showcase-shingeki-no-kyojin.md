Hey guys, and welcome back to another Skin Showcase. This time, we'll be looking at the Shingeki no Kyojin/Attack on Titan skin created by RA272Nirvash.

[The Shingeki no Kyojin skin](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/135349) was first uploaded on June the 31st, 2013 and has undergone a lot of updates and changes since it's first release. The skin uses the old skin style behaviour and has both SD and HD skin elements.

[RA272Nirvash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2019327) has put a lot of time and effort into this skin and it does show. The skin is fully skinned for all 4 game modes with only a few missing elements. RA272Nirvash has also gone that extra mile skinning some of the more minor elements such as the ingame volume bar

Also I've created a [skinning showcase log](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/166778) displaying previous skins I've showcased. So if you've missed any showcases, feel free to stop by.
