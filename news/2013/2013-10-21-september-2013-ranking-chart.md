Here, have some september ranking charts! Note that as of this chart, the chart names are based on the month from which ranked maps were taken. Should be a bit easier to understand this way!

Congratulations to last month's winners! And a big thanks to [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/OnosakiHito) to publishing the chart itself!
