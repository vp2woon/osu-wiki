Hello everyone! It's been roughly a year and a half since the last release of the osu!monthly and I'm very excited to say that we're back! ...sort of! Quite a bit has happened since October of 2011 (time flies, doesn't it?!). There's now a new game mode, a little bit over a million new players, new tournaments, and quite a bit of new additions to the team! Over the time the osu!monthly has been gone, osu! has garnered tremendous progress, which leaves us quite a bit to cover over the next few months!

**What is the osu!monthly?**

The osu!monthly's original concept was to be a newsletter for the community to find the highlights of the game each month. Over the timeline of the project, it's progressed into a magazine of sorts, but we've decided to turn back to the root of the idea. The monthly is now transitioning into a blog-type publication – updates are posted in more frequent intervals, and are separated by individual posts now, rather than an entire issue.

Our goal is to provide information about the community and be open to ideas from the community about anything happening on osu!. We understand that the forums can be an overwhelming place for someone who's new, and that's why the osu!monthly was conceived in the first place; to be the bridge between the information and to those that are interested in reading it.

**Who's "we"?**

In the past, the team has had people from 5 of the 7 continents working together on the osu!monthly team. Of course, like all jobs, people come and go, and our team is no exception to this. We now have a team of 16 people! The team has undergone quite drastic changes to the organizational structure from the last issue, to the point where it barely resembles the original osu!monthly team any more.

**What can I do to help?**

Feedback is always greatly appreciated. You can reach the editor-in-chief through email at [dkun@ppy.sh](mailto:dkun@ppy.sh) or by sending a tweet to @osumonthly. You're also free to contact any of the other team members through the forums or in-game.
