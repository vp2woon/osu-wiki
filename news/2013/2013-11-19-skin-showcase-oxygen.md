Hey guys, and welcome back to another skin showcase. This time, we'll be looking at the Oxygen skin created by Lespedeza.

The [Oxygen](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/158316) skin was first uploaded on the 5th October 2013, and I have to say, I am very impressed with this skin. The skin is very clean and I can tell a lot of time and effort was put into this. Even the score numbers have had that little extra bit added to them to try make even better. Sadly though, there isn't much to the skin only covering osu! standard with a few missing elements, like the mod icons.

Even without the mod icons, this is still a very good skin. I have heard that [Lespedeza](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3074492) is interested in skinning them, but didn't have any solid ideas. But that was a month ago, so maybe we'll see an update if we're lucky! I should also mention that the skin uses the old style skin behaviour.
