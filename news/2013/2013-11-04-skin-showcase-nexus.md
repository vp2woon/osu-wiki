Hello there, and welcome to the first skin showcase. The idea behind this showcase is to share some well made skins that deserve to be recognized. I'll post a few facts about each skin as well as a video showing off key parts of the skin.

The first skin we're showing is one of the most well known skins of all, and that is the Nexus skin created by Xiao. The Nexus skin was first unveiled in June 2011, and has over 13,000 downloads!

The original Nexus skin had separate elements in an "add-on" that changed the look of the ingame skin elements. After the new style skinning behavior was added, Xiao reuploaded the skin to fix the ranking panel, and also uploaded the add-on pack as a whole new skin! Enter the Nexus Ivory skin; the original Nexus skin was renamed to Nexus Slate.

The first half of the video shows off Nexus Slate, while the second half displays Nexus Ivory.

You can find the skin [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/55948).
