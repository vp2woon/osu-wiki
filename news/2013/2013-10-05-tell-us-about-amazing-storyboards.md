Although there have been many great storyboards recently - and even some absolutely stellar ones - storyboards have gone largely unnoticed by the general osu! playerbase. Here's your chance to change that!

For those of you who don't already know, storyboards are animations that move across the screen during gameplay. A skilled storyboarder can use them to tell a story, create high-quality video-like effects in the background, and even augment the map elements themselves! However, despite the huge amount of effort certain storyboarders put towards their creations, these works of art are barely paid attention to at large. Some of the greatest storyboards of all are on maps with little to no plays, which is quite a shame. **This is where you can help!**

If you have a map in mind whose storyboard left you in awe, made you laugh, or even just complimented the beatmap as a whole, please submit it below. The best and brightest of the storyboards submitted here will be put into a highlight post; this will either be a monthly post or a weekly one, depending on the amount of submissions we receive.

[Submit your favorite storyboarded map here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlIqmZ-C6_BzTgJ8_b3yXVrJ6Y07r1sFvocHtcz_F4Dpki5g/viewform)

We hope to discover some unfound gems with your help! :)
