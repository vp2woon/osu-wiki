Maps don't have to be ranked in order to be high-quality. Today, we're looking at a graveyarded map with one of the greatest storyboards of all time.

**[Brief and Trunks - Konbini](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/31084)**\
**Map and storyboard by [Gens](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23062)**

This song is associated with a fairly popular meme, in which people would animate their own version of the official PV that came with the song. osu! is no exception - using art drawn by [Lichatte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/37138), Gens managed to create his own perfectly-animated osu! version of the video using storyboarding alone. Although they're a bit dated, there are many inside jokes featured in this storyboard - if you've been around osu! for a while, see how many you can spot!
