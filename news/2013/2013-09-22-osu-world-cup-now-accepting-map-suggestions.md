We are currently preparing to kickstart the registration phase of the osu! World Cup in mid-October. In order to make the next OWC a great experience for both players and spectators, we need your help with map selection!

As you know, our dedicated map selectors try to pick high quality and difficult maps to push the best of the best players to the limit, but unfortunately, a lot of good maps get lost and forgotten in the huge amount of ranked maps. To remedy this, we'd like to ask the community for suggestions. Every suggestion will be considered, and you may even see your suggested map played in the OWC!

If you'd like to suggest a map, simply fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KLcEes6h_LAwrRBQt-tWq3Bty6no6ZTAGj_8eUPfu30/viewform). Do ***NOT*** suggest maps in the comments of this post, as they will not be considered.

**Please keep in mind that all suggested maps must be ranked or approved and should not exceed a length of 10 minutes.**

Thank you in advance.
