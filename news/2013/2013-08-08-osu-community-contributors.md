Over the past four years, osu!'s community has grown dramatically. Many users from places all over the world and from all walks of life have come together from a common love of rhythm.

A few distinct individuals have taken it upon themselves to provide service to the osu! community at great cost to themselves - tools and features that many of us take for granted today. In light of this, a new profile badge distinction has been created, awarded only to those who have gone above and beyond their peers in contributing to our wonderful community.

The first recipients of the community contributor badge are as follows (in no particular order):

- [Darkimmortal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10886) - for developing and maintaining the popular osu!record replay recording service
- [nanashiRei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/807630) - for developing and hosting one of osu!'s longest running beatmap mirrors
- [RBRat3](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/307202) - for numerous (beyond count) graphical contributions to the game client and everything else
- [Ballance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165946) - for designing and drawing our fantastic achievement artwork
- [akrolsmir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/576800) - for developing and maintaining AIBat, arguably the most popular third-party beatmap modding tool ever produced
- [statementreply](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/126198) - for outstanding performance in bugfix/feature testing and coding numerous utilities for mappers and modders
- [Loctav](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/71366) - for his tireless efforts in organising several major official tournaments (including the OWC)
- [Blazevoir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/120265) - for her utterly insane moderation track record (equivalent to roughly 6 staff members) and almost single-handedly moderating #osu during peak hours (9k+ users)
- [Piotrekol](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/304520) - for developing and maintaining osu!stats and developing a number of useful utilities for both beatmapping, modding and general play
- [MillhioreF](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/941094) - for outstanding performance in bugfix/feature testing and handling user support queries
- [DeathxShinigami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/49516) - for 3+ years of silent work tirelessly handling beatmap packing and several years of managing the beatmap charts

And a super special mention for our oldest contributors:

- [LuigiHann](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1079) - for years upon years of service, including designing the original beatmap skin, advancing storyboarding as an art and motivation
- [awp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2650) - for early community management and moderation and huge contributions over the course of his time here
- [Sinistro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5530) - for being the first impromptu community manager and global moderator, who set the bar extremely high for the GMT to follow
- [Ivalset](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/827) - for being the first staff manager and BATmanager and single-handedly forming an elite beatmap moderation team from nothing

To all of these people, thank you. Thank you for your efforts in providing vital services to the osu! community - and while I know that there are others out there who are yet to receive accolades for their work in making osu! a better place for everyone, know that your time is coming, and I know who you are.

This will not be the last time these badges are given out.

Congratulations to all of the recipients!
