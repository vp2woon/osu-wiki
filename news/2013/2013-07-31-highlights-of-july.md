**osu! hit 3 million users!**

Since osu!'s creation, the amount of registered users has just been going up faster and faster! Let's take a look at the amount of users osu! has gotten over time:

And let's not forget some other milestones, too - in the very first week of July, we've obtained a grand total of 100,000 likes on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/osugame), and a staggering 1,500,000,000 ranked plays. That's a billion and a half, all since late 2007!

**The osu! API has been made public!**

osu! has had an API for quite a while, but it has been private for the most part until the beginning of July, when peppy made it available for everyone. Stats from user profiles can be retrieved easily, top50 rankings from maps are available, and more! The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/ppy/osu-api/wiki) - programmers who wish for more features from the API can request them [here](https://github.com/ppy/osu-api/issues).

**osu! now has two brand new score meters!**

Two new in-game overlays have been added as a metric for watching your own performance or others'. The first, a hit error meter, shows how close or far you were from hitting exactly on time. The second is a "color meter", which shows the results of the accuracy judgement on the last hits. You can enable them from the right-hand side of the Options menu, under the Graphic tab.
