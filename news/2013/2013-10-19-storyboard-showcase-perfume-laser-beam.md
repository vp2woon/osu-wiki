Apologies for the delay, but better late than never, right? Our second storyboard showcase features a beatmap that has been ranked just recently.

**[Perfume - Laser Beam](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/106568) by [Raging Bull](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/398760)**\
**Storyboard by [Breeze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/77537)**

Based loosely around the official music video, this map's storyboard manages to beautifully pop in subtle flashing lights and creatively-designed lyrics without disturbing the flow of gameplay. If you know the music video well enough, you'll know what to expect near the end of the map!

As before, we are always taking suggestions on what map to show off next. If you haven't already, [feel free to pitch in your suggestion](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlIqmZ-C6_BzTgJ8_b3yXVrJ6Y07r1sFvocHtcz_F4Dpki5g/viewform)!
