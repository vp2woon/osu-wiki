In preparation for a new implementation of the ranking system (known to many as ppv2), I am cleaning things up. The first part of this is to hide players which have been inactive for over a month.

If you notice your pp score missing, please make sure to play at least once a month to keep it visible.

This is a move to try and keep the ranking fresh and relevant – players which have long left the game (or are not currently active) add noise which dilutes the huge *active* portion of the osu! community.

Note that this change is currently rolling out, and may it may take a day to take see the full effect. Also, if your accuracy is showing 0%, please rank once or wait for a day.

## Frequently asked questions' answers

- Map scores are not affected.
- Map weightings are not affected.
- If a player comes back after being inactive, they will have their old rank (with adjustment based on how other people's ranks have changed, as expected).

I hope you can all agree that this is a positive step forward. More to come soon!
