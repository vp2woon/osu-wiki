With the OWC well underway, let's take a little break from all the stress with a calm, feel-good song for this week.

**[Owl City - Gold](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/65146) by [inverness](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1361697)**\
**Storyboard also by [inverness](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1361697)!**

This map is a very good example of a "lyrics storyboard" done right. Each and every line is well thought-out, and the wallpaper backgrounds are very atmospheric and fit the music perfectly. Combined with incredible flow and amazing hitsounding in the beatmap itself, this map and song is bound to be a pleasure to play.

Now that we have deadbeat graciously doing his own skin showcase, I think it would be best to alternate skins and storyboards once a week. What do you think would be the best frequency and schedule for these highlights? Comment below!
