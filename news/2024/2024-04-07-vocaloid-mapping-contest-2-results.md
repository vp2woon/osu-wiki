We have all been eagerly awaiting the results of the contest themed around the incredible music of [iroha(sasaki)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/399). Well, worry no longer, for they are here!

The [**Vocaloid Mapping Contest** (***VMC***)](/wiki/Contests/VMC) features vocasynth music that hasn't received the appreciation it deserves. The task that mappers were challenged with was to create the best map using [one of the 5 songs provided](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-01-28-vocaloid-mapping-contest-2#songs). Now, normally that is challenging on it's own, but it's not every day that your maps get judged by a VOCALOID mapping legend, namely **[NatsumeRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/151679)**!

Below we will go through the results for each of the modes, so feel free to skip to the one you're interested in!

### osu! results

This contest's submissions were immediately sent to the eyes of our discerning [judges](/wiki/Contests/VMC/2#judges) after the mapping phase. Despite the relatively short mapping phase, the participants did a great job, and their passion for the music is clear.

This was a long (though in some ways very short) and challenging mapping contest and all the participants did a wonderful job.

If you didn't win this time, fret not, for we will return in the future with another contest. Feel free to let me ([-White](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16276548)) know if you have any feedback or ideas for what you'd like to see for next time!
