Showcase your unshackled creativity to its fullest by participating in the newest skinning contest!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-04-09-skinning-contest-unchained/banner.jpg)

The skinship team has thrown all caution to the wind and unlocked the ultimate skinning contest theme... which is that there isn't one. Yes, you heard that right!

With a throwback to the [1st skinning contest](/wiki/Contests/Skinning_Contest/1), the participants will once again be able to unleash their inner artists as **there is no theme restriction for this contest**. This means you can make a skin centred around anime girls, video games that heavily involve anime girls, online personalities that are themselves anime girls, or perhaps a skin that doesn't include any anime at all (don't worry, we won't judge you).

Not only is the (lack of) theme reminiscent of the past, but the contest schedule will also return to a former timetable, namely giving us *two contests per year*.

Regardless of whether you are a seasoned skinning contest veteran or if this is your first time joining us, let's first get familiar with the rules as well as the proper way to submit your beautifully crafted masterpieces!

## Participation

As per the usual, all skins have to be created from scratch and be aligned with the rules listed below!

In order to submit your skin you must:

- Post your entry on the forums under the [Work In Progress Skins](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/119) subforum
- Post a link to your entry in the [submission thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1906588) using the format listed in the post

The submissions will not be anonymised due to the requirement of posting your finished works of art on the skinning forum, so feel free to show off your work as much as you want!

## Voting

After the submission phase is completed, the voting phase will be announced via a separate news post with more details. The voting will stay open for 14 days, and once the voting closes, the full voting results will be visible on the contest page, followed by the top 3 participants receiving their prizes.

## Rules

- Submissions must not contain inappropriate, malicious, or epileptic content, and should adhere to the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules).

  - textures
  - artworks (e.g. stock images or anime artwork)

- The majority of the in-game menu interface and at least two game modes have to be skinned. In other words, in addition to the gameplay elements, the following segments shouldn't be left default:
  - ranking panel
  - song selection
  - mode selection
  - mod icons
  - pause and fail menu
  - main menu (optional, but highly encouraged)
- Submissions must be new creations — only skins posted within the submission period will be accepted.
- Each submission must be accompanied by a forum thread in order to participate in the contest.
- Submissions must be made in time. Latecomers will not be accepted.
- Submissions must not be created as a part of, or be involved in a paid commission of any sort.
- Submissions must be created individually. Teams/collaborations are not allowed.
- The file size for your `.osk` submission must be below 100 MB.
- Please submit a 16:9 image representing your skin, since this will be used as a cover on the contest page. This image must be at least 1280x720.

**Failure to comply with the contest rules may lead to disqualification, or, in severe cases, exclusion from future contests.**
