Touhou arrangements are the foundation of niche music scenes. Thanks to **Takamachi Walk**, even more Touhou arrangements are now part of our Featured Artist library!

Pulling influence from groups like *Draw the Emotional*, *Foreground Eclipse*, and our very own [UNDEAD CORPORATION](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/45), **Takamachi Walk** is the circle behind a new wave of metal and post-hardcore Touhou tracks.

More specifically, we have **9** tunes packed into pre-timed beatmap templates, all downloadable from [**Takamachi Walk**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/404)!
