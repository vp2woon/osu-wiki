Welcome or welcome back to The Followpoint, a "community spotlight" series where we interview various players and community figures to get to know them better!

We are back with a second interview of a special set of players, namely the very top of each game mode, this time featuring [YesMyDarknesss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4158549) (a.k.a Hyperw7), osu!catch rank #1 player and currently the longest-standing #1 of all game modes!

If you find the these insights from top players interesting, you might also want to check out [mrekk's interview](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-05-06-the-followpoint-mrekk-the-osu-standard-prodigy)!

Let's start now, shall we?

(Note that *some of the answers have been reworded for better readability*.)

---

*Let's start with an introduction, how would you introduce yourself to people who don't know you?*

> I'm the fruit catcher, my skill is declining every day, but I stay at #1 thanks to my old scores. I'm at my sunset, so another sun will rise soon.

*How did you get introduced to osu! and what was your first impression of it?*

> I first saw the game 10 years ago while watching YouTube or surfing the web. It was a score by [ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) in osu!catch. After that I installed osu! and for first 4 hours I was playing standard, but after that I changed game mode to ctb, thinking "OH, this is that game", and that's where I decided to continue playing catch until I'm gone.

*Why did you choose to play osu!catch of all game modes osu! has to offer?*

> As I said in a previous answer, first time I saw osu! was ExGon's score, and that's when I started to play osu!. That's one of the main reasons I continued playing catch, as well as it being easy to start (but ducking impossible to master). So after I found osu!catch, I started to grind it a lot. I think my goal at that point was to become a superior player like [ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187).

*What do you think of the osu!catch and its community in its current state?*

> Sadly, it's a dying game mode, and there isn't much to attract a lot of players. It's easy to join, but hard to understand the logic. Looking from the outside, most of people are saying that catch looks "super easy" and then don't even try, because it "looks easy". Not many understand that this game mode gets harder and harder as you play more.
>
> Our community is quite small, because not many new players join, so sadly it's mostly the same people for years. I'd recommend people to actually try playing catch â€” maybe you'll like it and become the next star!

*Do you have any advice you would give to people who want to or just started playing osu!catch?*

> A lot of people ask me that actually. Something I'd like to say first is that there is no easy way to become better at rhythm games. Most people don't even have a play count close to my [Calamity Fortune](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/114741#fruits/344892) attempts (which is around 10,000), which I believe is too early to understand the game mode properly. After getting close to that play count you may finally start to understand what the game is and how it works fully, not only in catch, but in other rhythm games too.
>
> Next, I'd like to talk about how to practice. In rhythm games, there aren't many tips on how to improve. I think tips are more about how to hit special patterns, not something that applies to the whole game. If a "tip" applies to the entire game, then it's not really a tip anymore; it's skill.
>
> So, what I want to say is try to figure out the best practice method for you. In my case, I was spamming retries a lot, playing each hard map more than a thousand times. But even while spamming retries, you need to think about the reasons for your gameplay, like "Why did I miss that pattern?" or "Do I need to use a faster or slower rhythm?" or "I need to memorize the position of the fruit in this part."
>
> Yes, after you move past the spamming phase, you need to find your own reasons for your gameplay. Why did you miss? How do you catch the patterns? What rhythm should you use?
>
> In my case, when I miss a section, I keep trying to change my tapping rhythm. If I were tapping my keyboard at 1/4 in one moment, I would switch to 1/3 or 1/6, constantly adjusting my tapping. Once I found the right rhythm, I memorized it and kept it in mind when retrying the map.
>
> After that, I focus on the hard patterns of the map and replay those parts over and over. If a map feels easy to full combo or play except for one difficult pattern or part, then that part is your weakness. In rhythm games, if you're a picky eater, you won't survive.
>
> Finally, the way to practice in osu!catch (hurray). In this game mode there is special a tech called "[pixel dash](/wiki/Gameplay/Edge_dash)", where you have to catch the edge of one fruit in order to reach the edge of the next fruit. You have to control your catcher really accurately during these patterns.
>
> So, sometimes it's better to play easy maps, but catch the fruits with the edge of the catcher. I sometimes practice by catching all patterns with the right end, left end, or both ends of the catcher. This helps you get comfortable with the technique, making your movements smoother and improving your timing in osu!catch.

*What is your favorite osu!catch score you've set?*

> Hmmm, there are too many scores to decide. My favorite catch score is probably [Chroma - I [AI] +HR](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/1956565686)? My other scores can be replaced by other pro players, who play better than me, but I still can't understand how I did CS 5.3 with HR.

*What made you play [Xronier](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1506066#fruits/3109464) using the "[guitar hero playstyle](https://www.twitch.tv/yesmydarknesss/clip/InnocentAbstemiousYakPupper-vX89K6koYLVGQQdP)"?*

> I've played a few times in Guitar Hero style even before Xronier just for fun, and one of my best scores done in this playstyle on [ADHD](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1789527#fruits/3666753) is also my personal [Hidden mod pp record](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/1957545279).

*Who would you call the best osu!catch player(s) at the moment and why?*

> In this generation I would call [Motion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3885626) the best player. He has mastered multiple techniques, has crazy speed, and even has a lot more clean movement. A complete all-rounder.

*What would you call the most impressive skillset in catch?*

> I'm really sad to say it, but it's probably the "pixel dash", which I often called a "luck issue" before. It's unique to osu!catch, and you must practice this tech, because it will be hard to improve later if you find it difficult.

*What do you feel is the most important aspect to remain motivated even when you are not improving?*

> Never give up, even if you feel exhausted, tired, mad, sad, crazy, etc., just don't give up and keep playing. Then one day the result will come to you.

*Have you considered coming back to mapping?*

> Thanks, but I'm terrible at mapping. I can't imagine my map being considered for the Ranked section.

*What other rhythm games besides osu! do you play?*

> I've been playing CHUNITHM recently at the game center and want to get 17.00 rating, but it's hard to do that.

*To finish things up, what does the future hold for you? Do you have any goals or anything else that you'd like to mention?*

> If I have enough time to play osu! then I will be back one day. It would be nice to set my own scores again.
