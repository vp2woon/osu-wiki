Love is in the air, and so are the pleasant vibes brought to you by the Project Loved team on this adorable day!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

In case you're still living under a rock, or have freshly blossomed into the community, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As per usual, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the January votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, visit the following links:

We'd like to thank them for playing instrumental roles in their respective fields and wish them the best going forward!
- With -NoName- leaving, [0x84f](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724) and [aceticke](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8838763) will be taking on the mantle of the coordination role. Please wish them luck in their adventures of making sure everything is running smoothly and on time!

For this month's *Outstanding Oldies* pick, we are going back to 2012 with [Strawberry](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/519978) and [CSY the corrupt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/304513)'s [Sum 41 - No Reason](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/60228#osu/199699).

When it comes to top-tier unranked old maps, this map is most likely the one that comes to mind. Although this set is certainly not perfect, what it lacks in polish it makes up for with bundles of character with each difficulty offering linear patterns, streams, and distance-snapped jumps. It is inevitable that this map remains an absolute joy to play, just as it was almost 12 years ago.

If you're an old map enthusiast, or just looking forward to seeing more classic bangers like this one appear in Loved, then give it a vote!

If [Everything Will Freeze](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/158023#osu/555797) is so good, then how come there isn't... oh.

For this month's *Daredevil Difficulties* pick, we also bring you one of the most popular Graveyarded mapsets out there. [Seni](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4830261) is no stranger to most osu! players with a multitude of popular *Foreground Eclipse* mapsets. This time, he's taking on a song with a rather similar style and executes it flawlessly. Of course, don't expect it to be easy. 220 BPM spaced streams and jumps await you, all on an extremely polished mapping style that we're sure you're going to enjoy.

Well, this one is rather overdue, don't you think?

[SkyFlame](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3552948)'s mapset of [ZAQ - Seven Doors](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1078911#osu) instantly strikes you as a map that should be Ranked â€” a "Ranked Reject", perhaps...? Well, fear not, we've come to save it from the Graveyard. It's not quite the pp-awarding solution, but hey, we're doing our best!

This mapset features difficulties from many well-regarded mappers, and tops it all off with a top difficulty from SkyFlame himself and his iconic jump-heavy style that is adored by many players alike. What's not to like here? It's time to give this a leaderboard, and you know it.

Let's join [Voltaeyx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2715118) on an adventure in this month's *Gameplay Gimmicks* pick!

Wait... Voltaeyx? Yes, that's right! It's the same legend that had previously graced us with stunning 2B maps such as [Mayday (feat. Laura Brehm)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/756794#osu/1605148) and [Lullaby](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/790928#osu/1659472). He's back and I'll be damned if this isn't one of the greatest 2B maps I have ever seen. This time we're featuring [in love with a ghost - interdimensional portal leading to a cute place feat. snail's house](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1901782#osu), custom-made for [GST:LIVE 2022](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-11-13-osu-singapore-aef-online-2022).

Usually, 2B maps don't go beyond simple object overlaps like having to click two hit circles at the same time, or clicking a hit circle while already holding onto a slider that hasn't ended. The patterns and sliders in this map are a refreshing take to this genre and Voltaeyx has pushed himself even further, the map being completely SSable, even on ScoreV2. That's not something any 2B map can just accomplish, and I don't even know of any other mapper that is capable of achieving that intendedly.

If you want to see what more could be possible and who is the true master of 2B, or if you just enjoy playing this map, vote yes for Loved! Let's push ourselves to the limits just like Voltaeyx and get some crazy scores!

Let your cursor float to the music, and sit back and relax, but watch out for the tricky rhythms though. Those will catch you off guard if you're not careful enough...

Last month, we covered some of the more end-game beatmaps, so this time around, we're taking a step back and giving you something somewhat easier.

These two difficulties might not be everyone's cup of tea, but be sure to try them. The low approach rate combined with the higher circle size will certainly throw off some players that are more used to high approach rates. Now, of course, this is not the only gimmick of the beatmap. Both difficulties have a lot of big spacing between notes and even a bunch of edge jumps.

Give them both a whirl while sitting on the edge of your seat to try and catch some of the edge jumps!

[-Ken](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4430811) made a name for themselves throughout the last couple of years, not only as a player, but also by contributing a lot of maps to the community. They are not an unknown name to the Loved section as they already have a couple of Loved mapsets. *Tribal Trial* is another of their sets that I think deserves some more attention.

The map has a good mix of different styles. First, it is a very technical map with interesting patterns and lots of unique wiggle patterns instead of always using the same kind. Second, it makes good use of hyperdash-intensive patterns scattered throughout the map, which accompany the song well. The map always keeps your attention â€” there is no section where you can rest or feel at ease. While it is not a long map, it can still be quite taxing and challenging not to lose consistency. If "Wrath" is too hard, there is also a significantly easier Overdose to play, so there is something for novice players to try as well.

It's been a while since you saw a [rostld](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4365562) Loved map come up to the stand, hey? Well, he's back.

This time, it isn't a lawnmower â€” it's the weeds from the garden stuffed up into a map and offered to you.

Choose between pixel terror (real jumps) or a more relaxed playing experience (Happy Hardcore). You, as the player, get to choose.

I am only doing this nomination to summon [ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) to come and set an insane score because I am bored. Cheers, here is more content for "ctbpol" â€” best of luck.

As an SV player myself and from interacting with the SV community, there's something I wanna say about [zero2snow](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7751516) and this month's special: *Hyou Ryuu*.

There's pretty much no doubt about it: the other option besides *Hyou Ryuu* would have been [easymotion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/948786#mania/1981394). I see *easymotion* as being revered by veterans of the community and players with a taste for simple, but effective gimmicks. And honestly, *easymotion* really excels at that. I should also give a shout out to the more recent [MWC 4K 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_4K)â€“featured [Cyber Thunder Cider](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2051849#mania/4284940), which zero2snow set as a challenge to themselves to deliver with the least amount of timing points possible. Another demonstration of minimal, but effective concepts.

So now that I have talked about those other maps, what about *Hyou Ryuu*? *Hyou Ryuu*, first featured as an [SV qualifier in the first iteration of the 4 Digit osu!mania World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/1#qualifiers), has stood for a long time as a prime example of pristine and clean execution of SVs. Even today, many SV players and mappers can attest to its quality and polish. It is a map that has been iconic not only for the tournament player base, but influential for the tournament mapper base as well, shaping the meta of SV qualifiers as a whole as time went on.

The map itself is fairly affordable, although not straightforward. It takes a bit of time and practice to get used to: internalizing the song structure, the song waning into a slow jam and picking up into more vivacious stutters at various times, and the kiai are all quintessential to understanding how to execute this map and how to handle the SV skillset as a whole. As such, I think *Hyou Ryuu* is a really good entry point to the wonderful world of tournament SVs.

As a conclusion, and after consulting with the Loved team, we have collectively concluded that *Hyou Ryuu* is more iconic *as a whole*, to the entire community. I do have a bit of a sentimental bias towards *easymotion* still as an SV player, but at least you now know it's gonna come up at some point in the future.

Do you have what it takes to play SV in 2024? Get your vote in, get yourself comfortable and spend one session or two on this one!

This month, we're giving you what can be called nothing short of a gem. [DonKiwi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14515506) is definitely not a name everyone is familiar with, but their chart of [Gemini](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1712507#mania/3499194) might be recognized by some, and is absolutely deserving of a nomination.

Being used in the Group Stage for [Speed of Light 3](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1686361?n=1), this gave exposure to someone who was completely unknown at the time. Alongside this, their chart of [Sleepy Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1735172#mania/3546335) was used in the round right after, which also proves how *Gemini* wasn't any kind of one-hit wonder. It's very rare to see tournaments picking up charts by someone without any form of reputation, but this goes to show how there can always be potential in the places you'd least expect.

All this talking aside, what exactly does the chart contain? To answer, it's a REALLY solid tech chart containing a plethora of patterns, such as dump-heavy sections with wide snap varieties, slight bursts, and some threatening jack sections, which despite what the star rating says, is no joke at 174 BPM. Even then, it's still at a skill level that allows a wide range of players to enjoy.

With that being said, it's heavily encouraged you help vote on this chart to give it the spotlight it deserves.

Chordjacks... why, of course! One of the more popular patterns of the newer generation of players, we certainly cannot afford to forget a map like this in the Loved category, and what better way to do it by introducing a new mapper to the scene: [ShibePlanet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11638901)'s debut with [Deep Down (Sped Up Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1900403#mania/3917286)!

It does start off with patterns that most players can do; however, once the song starts to pick up, I have a good feeling people are REALLY going to have a difficult time with how much the density picks up. Not only is it fast at 1.0x, but the patterns (such as anchors and numerous transitions to which hand you may need to put more effort in) will definitely be challenging for the average player. However, I'm sure many of you are DEFINITELY going to love the difficulties that this map will offer to you, and try to see how high the limits can go.

There are a few breaks here and there, but once those are done, the density picks up once again along with the same anchors and speed you saw in the first half. Oh, and let's not forget that there are different rates applied to this map. It essentially gives you a chance to play this on a slower rate if you want to practice reading and physically playing this map, or faster rates to try and push the limits of your abilities.

Do you have what it takes to get the highest score on this map? Push the limits of what anyone can do? Or do you want to support a new and upcoming mapper in the Loved category? Then go and give this map YOUR vote! Remember, your CHOICE matters!

This chart is **old**. When this was made, osu!mania didn't even exist, osu! as a whole was just 3 years old, and some of you reading this may not have even been born.

That's right, it was 2010, and a 12-year-old from Australia named cleaner88hpi had already been making *Stepmania* charts (files) for a while. They had been contributing to the infamous "Hard Songs Megapack" series (HSMP), a series of compilations of hard files starting all the way in 2007. By now they were all the way at their 12th iteration, where cleaner88hpi submitted a stream file charted to a trance remix of the infamous In The Groove song *Disconnected*. It is possible this remix was originally meant for the defunct ITG 3, which never saw the light of day.

Fast-forward to 7 years later. It's now 2017, and an osu!mania community member known as DDMythical is creating a series of dan courses as an alternative to the original 4K dans made by Shoegazer 2 years earlier. For these Reform dans, even though he's reusing some charts, he's picking new ones that he deems as more balanced. And for the speed map in his 9th dan, he picks a well-known stream chart from HSMP12. He picks... "Disconnected Trance".

It was clearly a known chart at that point, but that choice cemented its place not only in the *Stepmania* community, but also the osu!mania one, until this day. Oh, and that kid making charts back in 2010, what happened to them? Well, that name became Gammablaster somewhere around 2011, when they also started making their own music, mostly chiptune using LSDJ. They have kept making music ever since, but eventually renamed again to an alias which a lot of you may know well: [Aquellex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3137790).

And so, now we are in 2024. 14 years have passed since the creation of this map, and with the help of aquellex we are able to bring it to Loved voting with its original 2 difficulties intact. I hope you enjoy this blast from the past, however long you have been playing this game, and thanks again to aquellex for this opportunity.

I feel like everywhere I go this chart pops up somewhere (for a good reason). As a result we are finally giving [Undercover Martyn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6760124) the slot it deserves.

[Cokii-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6760124) is pretty well known for creating dumpy charts that are super addicting to play, and this is no different. From start to finish there is a great focus on simple streams that are mirrored and mapped to the vocals. All of this rewards accuracy players for their ability to "feel the rhythm".

Even though the chart may be simple, the addition of uprates allows for players to have fun with the simpler patterns that exist. To the people who vote on this chart, many surprises await you!

[HowToPlayLN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10879600) has made numerous kinds of maps in the scene. This map of [+ERABY+E CONNEC+10N](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1338625#mania/2772922) is certainly no exception, as it has proven to be quite a well-structured and very challenging map from start to finish. We've seen a long note map and an SV map on the Loved category, so why not have a Hybrid map for HowToPlayLN to showcase his mapping ability?

What makes this chart so difficult is not only how fast-sounding it is, but also the numerous patterns that are thrown into it. Of course, it being a hybrid chart means that there's a fusion of different kinds of patterns thrown into the mix, with minijacks, graces, rolls, and bursts for rice, plus density, technicality, and releases for LN. If the first 40 seconds of this map feels easy, don't let that fool you! Once that part is over, we start to see numerous instances of what makes this map so challenging.

Having an influx of patterns that could really make you miss would be nerve-wracking to play, especially if you're trying to shoot your shot at a top spot on the leaderboards, or ESPECIALLY if you are playing this in a tournament setting. We've seen this map being played in notorious tournaments, such as [Speed of Light 2](/wiki/Tournaments/SOL/2020), and the [Springtime osu!mania Free-for-all Tournament 6](/wiki/Tournaments/SOFT/6), just to name a couple. We've also seen players struggle on a few parts, and only a handful of players can secure an FC in the first place.

Let's not forget that these two tournaments used the short version of the map, which is around 2 minutes and 29 seconds long. What more is it if you were to challenge the full length of the entire chart, which is roughly 5 minutes long?

That being said, are you ready to show the world how skillful you are in these kinds of patterns? Then go give this map a positive review and support it through giving a positive vote!

I truly think that [Ticle](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11602148) has what could be considered one of the most unique charting styles when it comes to long note expression. I'm definitely not the only one to think this, as it's very likely that the first example that comes to mind when you hear their name is [Kamah (Scythe)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1314013#mania/2723400), which has already gained a reputation of its own for the way it was approached. Even with that in mind, I'd argue that this months pick, [Hole Dwelling](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1349241#mania), is no exception to their repertoire of iconic charts.

The chart itself, is... really hard to describe. To put it into words the best I can, it builds off of long note graces and unique releases, making it flow unlike any chart you've seen. Obviously, there's more to it than just that, but this approach led to one of the most unique ways to express a song, which truthfully, couldn't have been done any better.

Explaining how it plays doesn't do it justice. You really have to experience this for yourself, which is something any long note enjoyer should try. For those who've already played it, go give it a vote!

[Wonki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7898495) returns to the Loved section with this chordstream-focused pick! It's one of his beloved charts for the simplicity, yet demanding and fun-to-play patterning that introduces players to higher-density chordstreams. With many forgiving double gap stairs and widely spaced notes that take advantage of the space that 7 columns provide, this chart has been tested time and time again by players who gave very positive feedback!

To all the players who want to have a relaxing and fun session, this chart should definitely be in your collection.

Given how Wonki's mapping style has changed over the years, this one is definitely *the* chart that shows his strengths as a mapper. Balancing difficulty with fun and simplicity is no easy feat, but Wonki delivers time and time again.

We hope to see this map pass the voting stage, and if you agree please go give it a vote!

Really, this one is better if you just experience it yourself. Expect all kinds of wacky LN patterns, shields, bursts and jacks in full display.

Well, for the few of you that remain, you may already be familiar with [ccouy123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7089532)'s previous Loved map, [their GD on *Natsukoi -Instrumental-*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/868433#mania/2033215), so you have an idea of what to expect. The map we're presenting this month is similar to that GD, but with almost double the length, and dare I say even rougher patterning.

The shields, reverse shields and coordination patterns are in full display, with barely any breaks through the 4 and a half minutes this chart lasts. You are going to be holding LNs almost 100% of the time, juxtaposed against short LNs and rice notes scattered in the remaining columns forming awkward shields and minijacks, requiring a lot of coordination to execute all of it at once. All of it, set to the tune of a calm Chinese song, originally the opening of the wuxia series *Qin's Moon*.

If you are enough of a masochist that you read all of that and immediately want to compete on a leaderboard for a top placement, vote yes now!
