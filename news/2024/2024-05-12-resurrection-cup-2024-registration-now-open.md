**[Resurrection Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1919672?n=1)**, or ResCup for short, is an annual open-rank Team Vs tournament featuring teams of up to 8 players each, bringing a breath of fresh air to the top-tier competitive tournament scene. 

## Original music and original maps

Every year, we release many customs — both songs and maps, intending to create unique challenges for the players competing in the tournament. You may want to watch the following video, showcasing our notable original songs from the 2023 iteration, and expect an even higher quality of production in this year's iteration.

## What's new?

The match procedure and rescheduling method for the tournament remain the same as the 2023 iteration. However, we do have a lot of surprises up our sleeve this time around. Many new mappers and artists have joined our production team, bringing you over 20 memorable custom songs and over 80 beatmaps designed and fine-tuned by experienced mappoolers and playtesters.
