While it's great to see countries rallying together and forming teams to compete, sometimes we have to wonder what players could do if they didn't have to pick around their teammates and could shine on their own, and with the recent improvements made to osu!'s future client, we feel like it's finally time to bring to you...

This brand-new event will pit the world's 32 best players against each other in 1v1 matches played on **osu!(lazer)!**

The Grand Arena is going to be home to many experiments to the familiar tournament format. Featuring a full Featured Artist lineup, the players will now battle each other using **cumulative score difference**! This means that if you win by 20k, you are up by 20k for the rest of the match.

After being drafted, all 5 maps will end up played, and the score difference at the end determines who wins the match. This allows us to try out some new exciting ideas for players and viewers alike!
