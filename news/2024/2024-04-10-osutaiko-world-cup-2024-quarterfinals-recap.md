A lot of things happened in the osu!taiko World Cup between the 6th and 7th of April 2024.

After a slightly less eventful Round of 16 weekend, the Quarterfinals are coming your way just like a cup of good old Joe in the morning. Many exciting matches made this weekend a great one for the osu!taiko community, and we are excited to share the highlights with you!

Before we get into the juicy highlights, we need to first go over the mappool and the full results. Be warned though, this week's [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals) are bangers.

## Mappool showcase

The Quarterfinals pool has notably jumped in difficulty compared to Ro16, which should now match the difficulty of the qualifiers. A new map slot was also added to the pool with NM6, intended to contain speedtech picks.

A little birdie told us that players most often banned [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2159328#taiko/4552799), but picked [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1915414#taiko/3951566) the most, preferring to play faster picks with Hidden rather than slow ones. We also heard through the grapevine that both antimod (maps where using mods is less preferable, yet required) and normal FM maps were picked equally this time around. It should be interesting to see whether this trend continues.

Of course how could a mappool showcase ever go without showcasing the lovely osu! originals that have been cooked up, so let's dig in!

## Match highlights

### ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea vs. ::{ flag=CN }:: China

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

South Korea's osu!taiko reputation is described by many as "Japan's little brother". While that may seem like undercutting or perhaps even an insult, being second-in-command to a country who's won the past 10 world cups in a row should be taken as quite the compliment. This year is no different, with Korea seeding 3rd.

These are the Quarterfinals though, which means their opponent is not far behind. Team China, while not quite as decorated, is a bit of an unpredictability. Like having the pitcher at a baseball game pull out a rocket-powered glove, "What? How did they do that? I didn't know they could do that" is exactly how people have reacted to their past achievements, such as winning the [3 Digit osu!taiko World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/3TWC/1) and knocking out the United Kingdom in [TWC2023](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2023).

The South Koreans decided to test the waters with their first pick, [Street - Maritime Police](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2159322#taiko/4552776). Things start off well, though China stole a small accuracy lead… that they immediately proceeded to lose, as Korea snuck away with a win. They used their momentum for a few more points, with picks such as [Jimmy Weckl - System "Z"](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2092777#taiko/4387440) and [Feryquitous - Ai Nov](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2014150#taiko/4191502). And although China snuck in a point in the midst of chaos, Korea now held a 4–1 lead.

This meant it was the perfect time to bounce back! They quickly turned the tables with key picks like [succducc - me & u (Kara Edit)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2026921#taiko/4223441) and the biggest nail-biter in the pool, [Amon Amarth - Twilight of the Thunder God](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/531697#taiko/1126786). Despite being backed into a corner, Korea held the ground with a breakpoint win on China's last pick, narrowly avoiding a tiebreaker.

### ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada vs. ::{ flag=RU }:: Russian Federation

52 weeks ago, or 364 days ago if you prefer, Canada and Russia met on the battlefield in the Quarterfinals just like this year. However, back then, both teams dealt huge amounts of damage to each other and numerous breakpoints occurred. "That was not going to happen this year", both teams thought silently, and they couldn't have been more right.

It was a tough and destructive battle with almost zero breakpoints! Both teams really gave it their all. The lead kept flickering throughout the entire match and the tiebreaker's shadow was slowly revealing itself at the end of the tunnel. Near the end at the battle's pinnacle, Canada won their streamy [NM5 pick](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/531697#taiko/1126786), mapped 8 years ago by the one and only [frukoyurdakul](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7612550)!

The score was now 5–4, leaning towards Canada. Because of this, Russia decided to pick the [fast DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2159330#taiko/4552816), the banger of a lifetime mapped by legendary [D3kuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7807444), and all the spectators raised their hands for the upcoming stress-inducing battle — and holy smokes was this an intense battle.

Russia missed first but found a humongous trade from Canada. Both teams kept finding gigantic accuracy drops, but Russia crumbled under the enormous pressure at the end, and when the intensity loosened, everyone realised what had just happened. Canada won Russia's pick with the first breakpoint of the match, avoiding the menacing tiebreaker altogether. What a match!

## Round statistics

We have a couple of interesting statistics to share, and hopefully you will find them as cool as we did!

- ::{ flag=BR }:: [HiroK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4050738) achieved four 1x100 scores in a row, two of which being Free Mod maps with Hidden + Hard Rock.
- Team UK was only 1x100 short of a perfect 3,000,000 score on [Uroko - How 2(torial) move out](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2159324#taiko/4552782) to win their match against Team Taiwan.
- Team Chile was the first team to score a point against Team Japan after they went untouched in 2023, also on [Uroko - How 2(torial) move out](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2159324#taiko/4552782).
