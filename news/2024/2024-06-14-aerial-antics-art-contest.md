Dive with our mascots into this fanart contest with absolute freedom.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/header.jpg)

In a tale as old as time itself, osu! fanart enthusiasts gather up in a regular ritual and showcase their artistic prowess through cute pippis and stellar Mochas roaming around our earth and partaking in various adventures. This time however, there is no more earth, only sky, and everyone is airborne now! It's now your duty to paint the canvas of the heavens with the most vibrant colours you can muster!

To those who require clearer wording, this iteration's prompt is:

**Draw any of the osu! (or community) mascots engaging in sky-bound activities!**

Would you look at that: this time, the sky is literally the limit! Planes, floating islands, airships, blimps, parachuting – our osu! cast is taking flight up into a world above, real or imaginary. The only requirement for your artistic rendition of the mascots is being in the sky, and someone or something must be airborne.

In case your imagination is too clouded with endless possibilities that your head short-circuits, don't fret! Here are some example scenarios to take inspiration from:

- A bewildered Mocha looking at a pippi overhead, sailing through the air, piloting a small airship.
- A grinning Yuzu about to overtake Mani on an air race through alexithymic valleys.
- Did you know the fruits in osu!catch canonically fall from the sky? Where ~~on earth~~ might they come from?
- Mocha and Tama on a flight to compete in the greatest taiko drumming tournament (perhaps starting with either "o" or "E"?), with Tama "practicing" on her drum controller to the detriment of the other travellers, while a dreamy Mocha is relaxing with headphones and the atmospheric view of Don-shaped clouds.
- A secretly adventurous Alisa dragging the normally composed Mari along on an adventurous trip in a weird but lively city that's built on the underside cliffs of a floating island.
- The osu! cast at a floating sky cafeteria with a view of radiant sunset clouds.

As always, a selection of the top-voted finalists will make it to the main menu and receive 3 months of osu!supporter, plus the top 3 will also receive fancy bespoke profile badges made from their own creations.

With that out of the way, let's get to—

Wait, hold on, we're getting an urgent call from the osu! headquarters...

*unintelligible mumbling*

...oh, one more thing: we're glad to announce that the top 3 finalists will additionally be available for everyone as a limited-time selection of default profile banners! Now's your chance to rep some osu! fanart swag in your profile page, even if you don't have an active osu!supporter tag!

The profile banners will be available from the results' announcement date until the next fanart contest.

## Rules

- **By submitting your artwork to this contest, you grant us permission to use your artwork in the main menu client should it win, and to use it in promotional material for both the game (osu!) and the contest (Aerial Antics Art Contest).** You retain all rights to your creation and you can sell it and distribute it however you like — it is your work, after all. We're just saying here that if you submit your piece to this contest, you should be okay with us using it.
- **All entries MUST follow the contest theme and contain AT LEAST one of the osu! official or community mascots.** Else, the Dean "peppy" Herbert may exercise his god-given right to blast you into the stratosphere alongside our mascots...
- **All entries MUST be suitable for all-ages viewing.** The sky is a place of wonder and beauty, not a place for the unsightly!
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK. REDRAWING AND COMPOSITE WORKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** Plagiarism sucks. Don't do it. Someone in the comments will call you out for it as has happened every other time someone's tried and they're going to do more damage to your reputation than us removing your entry from the voting will do. Use only your own work — brushes and the like are fine, but that's it! Don't redraw or trace someone else's work.
- **Generative art programs or methods (such as AI) are not allowed.** This includes any kind of software that has you supply a written or visual prompt and fills in large amounts of details for you. We will know if you do this. If we somehow miss it, the community won't. Don't sully your legacy as an artist!
- **Participants must keep a full file containing all of their entry's layers available.** We'll only ask you for this if we think it's needed to ascertain any claims regarding plagiarism or the use of generative art tools. If you don't/can't provide us this within a timely manner when we ask, we'll have no choice but to pull your listing from the contest, sorry!
- **Artist attribution (names, social media handles, etc.) must be limited to no more than three lines total and confined to any corner of your entry.** Being proud of your work is good, just do it in a reasonably small spot of your work. One thing unique to osu!'s history is that we really don't like forced advertisement, and attribution that is too large can come across like it.
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece — namely 2732x1536. THIS IS CHECKED BY A SCRIPT AND ENTRIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE DISCARDED AUTOMATICALLY.** This remains the \#1 reason for distressed emails sent after the contest about why an entry didn't make it in. Even ONE pixel off is enough. Export your creations at the correct resolution!
- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed on the main menu and during the voting process.** The circular spot in the middle shows where the main-menu cookie will be when inside the game. Factor this in when designing your piece, as anything inside it is likely not going to be seen. This doesn't mean leaving a big circular hole full of nothing in the middle! Be creative. *Make sure you don't leave it visible in your end result.*
- **Do not leave the dotted osu! cookie template visible in your submission.** Very proud of you so far, let's keep the streak up.
- **If you're using characters from other intellectual properties, do so sparingly.** All the official osu! mascots and the community mascots are fair game, but please avoid using excessive representations of characters from other worlds or franchises in your work — the contest is about osu! foremost, after all. Remember also that the community mascots are someone else's treasured creation, so please treat them with the same respect that you'd treat your own OCs and work.

Got any questions, or any urgent matters that need to be looked at? Don't hesitate to [shoot Hivie a message](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976) for any inquiries regarding this contest!

Alright, now we need you to lock in and head over to the [Aerial Antics Art Contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/215) once you've finished cooking your masterpiece and drop it in there. You may reupload your entry to your heart's desire if you want to make any adjustments, but you only have **20 days** to do so before the doors shut off forever, so don't brood over which edges to slightly reshade for too long!

Until then, good luck!

—Hivie & Walavouchey
