For those unfamiliar with this event, the **Mapper's Choice Awards** (or *MCA* for short) is a community-hosted event where mappers nominate and vote on maps and mappers for various categories in order to celebrate mapping excellence in all shapes and forms.

[Just like last year](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-03-03-mappers-choice-awards), there are many awards for the winners and runner-ups of every category! If you'd like to learn more, keep reading here and check out the [Corsace website](https://corsace.io/), where you can find the results of previous iterations of MCA and learn more about these events!

In addition, **A Year In Mapping** is what one would call the *Spotify Wrapped* for the osu! mapping and modding community, showcasing a variety of intriguing statistics gathered from across last year's maps, such as total number of guest difficulties, most mapsets ranked, most favourites and more. If this sort of thing interests you, read on!
