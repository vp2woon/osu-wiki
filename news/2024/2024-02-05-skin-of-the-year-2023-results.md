The 2nd annual Skin of the Year contest has concluded, with a total of **5480** users casting their votes, totalling up to **37,426** votes. Once again there was a very close battle between the top 2 skins, but regardless of the actual voting count, every skin highlighted below deserves their spot and will hopefully make its way into many more skin collections.

With the votes tallied up, let's take a look at the top 10.

[Saow](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9782756)'s [- KEMOMINI EDM SQUAD -](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1791845) skin will be very familiar to skin connoisseurs as it was created for last year's [Icons of an Era](/wiki/Contests/Skinning_Contest/4) skinning contest, whose theme revolved around memorable beatmaps and osu! mascots from the last 15 years of osu!. Saow did a beautiful job of capturing the spirit of a 2021 ranked map background found in [true DJ MAG top ranker's song Zenpen (katagiri Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1357624#osu/2809623), and netted themselves the 10th place with **714** votes.

Another Icons of an Era skinning contest entry grazes the top 10! [Ghost Rule](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1792933) by [Redo_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7122165) is a skin based on a couple of different beatmap sets of the song with the same name, all with similar art of Hatsune Miku. Featuring art by [xootynator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598), Redo\_ crafted yet another masterpiece, with which they managed to score **761** votes.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-05-skin-of-the-year-2023-results/Divide-by-8.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1792739)

[星塵 DIVIDE ÷ 8](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1792739), another entry from the Icons of an Era contest, expands on the theme presented by the background on [Sotarks' set of *quaver*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/873811#osu/1859185). Utilising a mix of very dark and bright colours, beautiful tones of purple permeate most of a backdrop bestrewed with bright, brilliant stars. For this stunning entry [thetasigma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6234482) earned themselves **767** votes.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-05-skin-of-the-year-2023-results/Paper-Touhou.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1746993)

[Touhou Project ~ Paper Touhou](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1746993) is a unique blend of the *Touhou Project* and the "paper" art style made popular by Nintendo ever since the year 2000. [CloudKeyz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15194624) used the original *Paper Mario* for the N64 as inspiration and combined many of the more well-known *Touhou* characters in order to craft a skin that has no right being as cute as it is, and for that they were awarded **782** votes.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-05-skin-of-the-year-2023-results/Everlasting-Moment.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1792308)

Despite the fact that they have only published 3 skins so far, [Chromasia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7306251) has exclusively released highly polished, quality works of art. It is therefore no wonder that their Icons of an Era contest entry also received **799** votes for this year's Skin of the Year contest. [Everlasting Moment](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1792308) focuses on art used behind [Seni's iteration of *Chronostasis*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1392153#osu/2874408) by Featured Artist [Release Hallucination](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/194), captures the essence very well, and expands upon the theme. Definitely be on the lookout for their future releases!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-05-skin-of-the-year-2023-results/IT_S-SHOWTIME.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1864406)

You really shouldn't be surprised that thetasigma is once again on this list, as they are a mainstay in the skinning community with many winning contest entries under their belt.

[IT'S SHOWTIME! feat. Hatsune Miku](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1864406), although released at the very end of 2023, still managed to get **827** votes, which really shows how much their skins are beloved by players. The skin itself has several art styles sprinkled throughout, ranging from graffiti to pixel art, and of course features the lovely Hatsune Miku! Surely they won't have another entry on this list... right?

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-05-skin-of-the-year-2023-results/Game-Over.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1801331)

Yup, it's thetasigma again. They have truly reached the endgame for osu! skinning, with **3** different entries of theirs making it to the top 10! [GAME OVER](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1801331) captivated **1026** gacha gamers with an 8 bit–like aesthetic, along with just a perfect amount of anime girl on top. The skin prominently features Silver Wolf, a character from the popular gacha game *Honkai: Star Rail*. Unfortunately for thetasigma, they were unable to hack themselves into more entries on this list, so it's *game over* for them.

Icons of an Era contest winner [Spoo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11805037) claims their spot on this list with their stunning entry [FOOL MOON NIGHT](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1775136). What's *A FOOL MOON NIGHT*? It's a song used in an [extremely popular 2016 beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/524026#osu/1141084), which featured a background that inspired Spoo so much that they decided to draw **all** the elements of this skin in its style! **1096** voters did not walk away in light of such dedication and decided to award their votes, pushing Spoo to 3rd place.

Our contest examination system keeps returning an error code for this entry: `N05T@LG1@_0V3RL0@D`. Let us know if you experience the same issue.

[Miorine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12630408) harnessed the full power of the holy trinity: early 2000s nostalgia, an extremely popular Windows operating system, and creativity. With those three combined, [Windosu XP](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1790353) was crafted, and it caught the attention of experienced Windows users right off the bat. Regardless of the fact that this is only the 2nd skin ever published by Miorine, they perfectly captured the nostalgia of many players, netting them a whopping **1511** votes, almost 400 more than 3rd place!

Everyone thought they were real funny commenting "rafis 2018-03-26 HDDT", or something along those lines. Well as it turns out, a skin with a similar amount of value, both historical and meme-wise, won this competition. That's right, [cyperdark](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9893708)'s [WhiteCat 3.0](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1864774) has been elected as the **Skin of the Year**, with **1574** votes! There isn't too much to say about the skin itself — it's centred around the top player [WhiteCat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101), it's clean, and it comes in a billion different variations to suit the needs of as many players as possible.
