At long last, **Nakura** pierces into our Featured Artist library!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/426/header.jpg)

With inspirations like our very own [S3RL](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/9), [Kobaryo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/96), and *Halley Labs* (the creator behind *Renard* tracks, *The Big Black*, and a bunch of other stuff you've probably seen on osu!), it's easy to tell that **Nakura** will fit right in here.

As an avid rave-focused musician, **Nakura**'s tunes are overflowing with high energy. Their sound has already been recognised by rhythm games like *SEVEN's CODE* and *TECHMANIA*, and osu! is joining that roster today!

[**Nakura**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/426) is officially home to **4** new tracks, including some osu!-specific short versions for mappers with chicken-nugget-sized attention spans.

See how **Nakura** translates to osu! for yourself:

That's all for now! If you're on the search for pre-timed beatmap templates, it's no coincidence that [**Nakura**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/426) has them. The 30 seconds you'd otherwise spend on timing are too valuable to waste.

And of course, another Featured Artist is on the schedule for next week!

Stay tuned.
