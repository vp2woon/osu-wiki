**Cansol** takes the plunge into our Featured Artists!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/407/header.jpg)

**Cansol**'s main goal is to simply make music that is both creative and fun, incorporating future bass sounds akin to [Zekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/76), [Mameyudoufu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/209), and [polysha](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/146), along with [Street](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/89)-inspired artcore, plus [Sobrem](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/338) and [NIWASHI](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/228)-esque jazz!

After making an impact in games like *A Dance of Fire and Ice*, *KALPA*, *Lanota*, *Rizline*, and *Dynamix*, it's about time **Cansol** stepped up in osu! too.

**5** songs are up for grabs on [**Cansol**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/407), including a brand-new [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals#osu!taiko-world-cup-2024) that debuted on [today's TWC livestream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2100512474?t=00h45m18s):
