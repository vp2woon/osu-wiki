The submission phase has officially ended on May 24th, and after a lot of hours put in by the skinship team in order to validate and screen all the entries, it's finally time to move on to the voting phase.

As mentioned in the [initial announcement](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-04-09-skinning-contest-unchained), there aren't any theme restrictions for this contest, which has translated into **27** brand-new skins, all yearning for your attention! As always, we highly recommend to head over to the [contest listing on the completed skins compendium](https://compendium.skinship.xyz/contests/5) and check out all the entries yourself, but if you are not into collecting skins, the team has compiled a playlist of showcase videos to help you still pick your favourites:

Made up your mind yet? If so, head over to the [contest page](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/208) and *unleash* your **3 votes**! The voting phase will last for the next **14 days**, so there will be plenty of time to decide.
