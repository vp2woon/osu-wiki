With the Grand Finals 2 weeks behind us, the 5 Digit World Cup 2024 is over. Come with us as we go through the incredible matches between this year's teams and get some insights from a runner-up, a contributing artist, our most active mapper and an admin.

Since last year's 5 Digit World Cup (5WC), lots of 5 digit tournament players anticipated the return of this event. This year's iteration introduced some minor modifications to tournament procedures while focusing on refining the competitive experience to be the best 5WC possible. With four fantastic original songs and lots of original maps made by our mapping team (of which many remained from last year), this iteration features effort far and above anything seen before in the series.

Let's get going, since we have seven weeks of amazing matches, highlights and a few interviews to go over.

## Summary

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-05-04-5-digit-world-cup-2024-concludes/podium.jpg)

Congratulations to Poland for taking the first place this year. The other Grand Finalist, Canada, gave them a scare by winning the first match 7–5, bringing them to a bracket reset! But Poland prevailed, winning the bracket reset match with a score of 7–5, making them the deserving victors this year.

We want to thank and congratulate Canada and the United States for once again playing their hearts out this year and reaching the podium. For Canada, their second-place finish is a return to the podium for the first time since 2019, with it also being their best result so far. For the United States, third place means their 6th consecutive top 8 finish and showing their consistency in forming great teams that get far into the bracket.

## Match highlights

### Round of 32: ::{ flag=BR }:: Brazil vs. ::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong

</div>

The Round of 32, the first round of the tournament, is usually a round without many close matches. This year however was different! We saw a bunch of close matches, but the match between Brazil and Hong Kong was the one that took the spot for most surprising match of the round.

Brazil, being the #10 seed from the Qualifiers, was the big favourite to move into the Round of 16. They were up against the #22-seeded Hong Kong, which should have posed no big troubles for the Brazilian team, but things turned out different.

After the start of the match, Brazil took a quick 2–0 lead, winning their protected HD2 and the FM1 pick from Hong Kong. Brazil picked NM4 as their next map, which in hindsight was not the right pick. Hong Kong came back and took three straight map wins, including two breakpoints, taking the lead in the match with a 2–3 scoreline. After taking the lead, Hong Kong was the next team to pick. They picked HR1, which resulted in Brazil getting a second breakpoint, tying the match at 3–3. After a back-and-forth between the two teams, the score ended up in a 4–4 tie, forcing a tiebreaker.

In the end, Hong Kong took the win and won the match 4–5, forcing Brazil into the losers' bracket and moving on to the Round of 16 themselves.

### Round of 16: ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland vs. ::{ flag=AU }:: Australia

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qY9OcD7yj3A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Moving into the Round of 16, we see what looks like an impossible matchup for Australia (#17). To move into Quarterfinals in the winners bracket, they must win against Poland (#1). The absurdity of this match cannot be understated.

In the beginning, all looked normal for Poland, the 98.6% favourite according to the week's [pick'em challenge](/wiki/shared/news/2024-05-04-5-digit-world-cup-2024-concludes/pickem.png), as they took an easy two points from Australia. This is the behaviour you expect from a #1 seed in the Round of 16, especially against a team who made it here via an upset against Sweden (#16).

As the match charges on, Australia managed to earn point after point. Expecting an easy 3-0 lead, Poland picked HR3 and lost by a huge margin (by nearly 500k points). The score was now 2-1 and the ball was in Australia's court. Looking to tie things up, the Aussies went for FM2 and managed to win by 300k — a second victory in a row over the goliath that is the Polish team. Everyone's pick'ems were already shattered by this point, but the Australian team still had more up their sleeves and the score is tied 2-2.

Lagging behind and desperately in need of momentum, Poland picked NM3. After an uncertain ending with ::{ flag=AU }:: [Trainjumper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2272587)'s client freezing on the livestream, the results were revealed in the [match logs](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/113190844). Australia won again and now had the advantage at 2-3. They shot for NM2 and won yet another point, somehow flipping the script and making Australia the one with match point against the would-be winners of the tournament.

In the end, the run of a lifetime dissolved as Poland locked in and surged for victory, ultimately defeating the Australians in a 5-4 tiebreaker victory. The fact this match went to tiebreaker at all is incredible, and we're certain the Australian team is proud of their efforts.

### Losers Grand Finals: ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada vs. ::{ flag=US }:: United States

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p521LJbPT48" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Fighting for a chance at the crown or being cast to 3rd place, both teams initially won each of their picks in lockstep, but Canada's strides seemed more confident with their wider score margins. The even scoreline lasted even as the US began to show force in their Hard Rock picks.

The first half of the match already revealed the stars of the show, with ::{ flag=CA }:: [ploot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7802400) carrying the Canadian team throughout their picks, and especially so during HD2, [t+pazolite - Heartache Debug feat. Akagawa Nene](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1833716#osu/3764512), snatching the lobby's only S-rank score at 99.45% accuracy. This was not without a fight from ::{ flag=US }:: [gilgamesh815](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14040810) and ::{ flag=US }:: [zfr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11536421), who also performed exceptionally well throughout.

Canada's slightly higher seed (#2 vs. #4) was first questioned when they almost lost on their own pick of [Hollow Wings](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/416662)'s famous map of [Halozy - Sentimental Skyscraper](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/100348#osu/412288), falling behind yet taking it back on the second half. Carrying this momentum forward, Canada took the first breakpoint on America's HR3 pick, but traded it right back with America's double EZ roster on FM2.

Another win from the US' own pick later and the two podium finalists were taken to the tiebreaker of [Sydosys - Epsilon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2166904#osu/4571684). After a mostly smooth first section of the song, everyone breaks combo on the transition except for two Canadians, and with ::{ flag=CA }:: [FetherFall](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15296550)'s subsequent break it was ::{ flag=CA }:: [Birchman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10676573)'s time to shine while building a devastating lead. The scoreline swung in Canada's favour, and with Birchman's 430k-score performance topping the lobby, Canada's advancement to Grand Finals against Poland was sealed at this moment.

## Interviews

Spectators see the matches and memories they create, but some memories reside in no other place than the people most involved. These are the reflections from a few of them.

::{#birchman}::

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-05-04-5-digit-world-cup-2024-concludes/Birchman.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10676573)

> Hi I'm Birchman, I've been playing the game off and on since August 2017, and I've been playing tournaments semi-actively since August 2022. I was on Canada's 5wc roster last year and had the chance to play for Canada again this year as well.

Team Canada, which includes [Birchman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10676573), went on to place 2nd this year in the 5 Digit World Cup 2024, narrowly behind Poland.

---

Did you have any expectations going into the tournament? What went on in your minds as your team progressed into further stages?

> I remember last year, Canada got top 6 in the tournament, and while I wouldn't say that I 100% expected a better placement from us this year, I was definitely hoping that we'd at least beat last year's top 6 placing.
> 
> I think as we got further and further into the tournament, we started analyzing the other teams more and some of our practice habits changed. I remember around the semifinals stage of the tournament, [Fetherfall](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15296550) would look at the mappool early into the week and started to highlight the maps depending on how much we needed to practice them which really helped. I think the team overall took the tournament more seriously as we transitioned into the later stages.

How did you prepare for matches and 5WC itself?

> For matches, we'd run multiplayer lobbies every week to practice the mappool as a team. On top of that our coaches [FlatPaper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11255340) and [LumenLogic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8171404) made comparison spreadsheets so that we could see how our opponents did in previous rounds compared to us. To prepare for 5wc itself, I personally tried to learn how to play with HDHR since if you had a player taking HDHR on your team, another player could go NM, and with the Freemod rules not requiring a player on HD, I thought I'd be more useful if I learned HDHR for the team.

Are there any specific moments you remember the most vividly?

> There were a bunch of great moments in this tournament, but I think my favorite moments happened in our match against the USA in losers bracket finals. After the match went to tiebreaker, I remember how happy and relieved the team sounded after winning such a hard fought match, as well as all the nice messages we exchanged with the US roster after the fact.
> 
> This whole match sort of stuck with me because of how close a lot of the members on Canada's and USA's rosters are to each other, and the sportsmanship shown in this match was just really heartwarming to see.

What was the first thing you did after the tournament?

> Honestly I was really sad after taking Poland all the way to bracket reset just to lose, and really didn't do too much other than thinking a lot about how the match could've ended with Canada winning.
> 
> But on a more positive note, a day after the tournament concluded, [LumenLogic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8171404) made an announcement in the Canadian 5wc server highlighting our performance, as well as Canada B and C team's respective placements in the 5wc's Minor League (a separately hosted tournament). In the same announcement he also gave a shoutout to all the people who were involved with tryouts and roster making this year, which was a nice way to wrap up 5wc for Canada.

> I'm a multigenre DTM producer that you probably don't know! I've been doing music for almost three years now and currently my style focuses on blending color bass elements with everything I do :3

[Naikou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/29139453) is no stranger to composing for osu! tournaments, with works spanning [Coul's Scuffed Overskilled 5 Digit Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1739981?n=1), [osu!mania SQUID GAME](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1745098?n=1) and [4 Digit Player Tournament 6](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1871322?n=1). For the 5 Digit World Cup 2024, Naikou composed [Beyond Reality](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2163553) as the Finals tiebreaker track.

---

How did you start out, and what drives you to make music?

> I started out in mid 2021 making *Metroid* remixes! I didn't really start doing rhythm game music properly until mid 2022, but I got my first big push to get into it with the 2022 Arcaea song contest and honestly the rest is history for me. My main drive after that has just been getting better and striving for quality over all things. I do music for myself before anything, so making things I'm proud of is enough to satisfy me :)

What was the process like to create *Beyond Reality*? Was there a main idea behind the composition?

> The process was mainly based on my section-by-section workflow. I start by getting a main inspiration for the theme (since there was no specific instruction in that regard) then when that's laid out, I start thinking about the bigger picture. In this case since I was doing a tiebreaker, I decided on what the focus would be (a tech tb this time around) and what genres I'd put in. Then it's just a cycle of figuring out what the next section is, finding a reference for said section and making it.
> 
> From a more abstract perspective, I wanted to have some kind of sci-fi vibe going because that's what I'm comfortable with, but I took the opportunity to make the track as a homage to [Akira Complex](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/51) by referencing [Reality Distortion](https://soundcloud.com/akira-complex/vs-akira-complex-reality-distortion-original-mix) heavily in the composition and track name.
> 
> I also referenced some other smaller parts from tracks with Akira Complex, but they aren't as notable as the main inspiration.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-05-04-5-digit-world-cup-2024-concludes/ajmosca.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19884809)

> Hi! I'm AJ, I'm a 4th year college student that started playing osu! in late 2020. In the last 2.5 years I've also become heavily involved in the tournament community, being a player and staffer for both rank-restricted and open rank competitions, as well as co-hosting a rank-restricted tournament, [Clashing Tides](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1759097?n=1), last summer.
> 
> Additionally, I've been mapping for over 2 years and have created several custom maps for community tournaments, in particular mapping [an osu! original song](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2088549#osu/4376782) composed by [seleP](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/138) for [OWC 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2023). I also have a couple ranked maps of my own, mainly guest difficulties.

[ajmosca](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19884809) mapped 5 beatmaps specifically for the 5 Digit World Cup 2024, or 5 "custom maps" as they're commonly known.

---

For people not so familiar with the subject, what might be the reasons for creating custom maps for tournaments?

> There are many reasons why a tourney would request mappers to make customs. The most common reason is that custom maps are fresh takes on the skillsets that a mappooler wants to test. One of the big struggles of mappooling is finding quality maps fit for tournament use (well-mapped and of consistent difficulty) that haven't been used too much in other tourneys before. At higher levels of play, this can be particularly difficult, which is why customs are considered the 'ideal' solution to this problem. (Some disagree with this, but that is a whole other discussion.)
> 
> Sometimes though, the reasons to create a custom can be significantly different. Some tourneys request customs because they like a mapper's style and want to use more maps from that mapper. Other times it's the mappers that request the customs themselves, looking to force themselves to map more or create something different from their usual maps. Some tourney hosts also believe it would increase the quality of their competition to have custom maps in their pools. And in rarer cases, you request a custom map because you commissioned a song from an artist for a competition and are in need of a map for it c:

How did creating 5 custom maps for 5WC 2024 come about? Was this a special occasion or were things business as usual?

> In this case, it was a perfect combination of organizers giving us ample time and freedom to choose what we would like to map, as well as a period of time where I had a lot of motivation to map in general. In particular, a good chunk of my winter and spring breaks from school were spent working on these custom maps.
> 
> The free time let me focus on mapping completely stress-free from school, which made me the most productive I've been in all my time mapping. For example, 2 of the 5 custom maps were started and finished all within the same week in January, and about 80% of my parts for the Finals TB were done in the week of my spring break.
> 
> This was DEFINITELY a special occasion, where circumstances just lined up perfectly — typically mappers just make a map or two over the whole tournament (myself included). In any other circumstances this would be a painful, if not impossible, thing for me to do, especially because compared to other mappers I tend to be a lot slower in creating maps, and also because maps tend to go through a quality assurance process before being released.

Having collaborated with a few artists at this point for original songs in your maps, how would you describe your experience this time mapping the [Finals tiebreaker *Beyond Reality*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2163553#osu/4562997)?

> Compared to my other original song maps, the highlight for this occasion was how closely I was able to work with the song artist themselves. Working closely with [Naikou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/29139453) during the various stages of creating this map was wonderful.
> 
> They provided so much for the map ranging from: different mp3 encodings to fit ranking criteria, the map's timing, the background, and even the song's sheet music to help us mappers in case we were confused about any rhythm. Being able to cycle feedback with the artist, both about the song and about the map, was an awesome experience and I believe it helped increase the quality of the final product significantly.
> 
> In terms of the mapping itself, this was quite a challenge. Those that know of my maps can attest that I don't map tech very often. Pushing myself out of my comfort zone to not only map in a style I don't have much experience with, but also have a final product that is cohesive with my collaborators, was very instructive for me as a mapper. I definitely felt myself improving so much during this process, and I'm very glad the final product was well received by the players.

::{#lupa}::

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-05-04-5-digit-world-cup-2024-concludes/Lupa.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4722369)

> Hi there! My name's Lupa and I've been playing osu actively since 2014. I've followed tournaments like OWC since then but have been especially involved in 4/5 digit tournaments since 2021, playing in about 35 tournaments myself and hosting 3 with a 4th on the way.

[Lupa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4722369) stepped up to the role of administration for 5WC 2024, as well as selecting the beatmaps that players can use in their matches (a process known as *mappooling*).

---

For people who are new to tournaments, what might go into the roles of "administration"?

> Tournament administration is a really loaded role because as a host you're responsible for each and every facet of a tournament player's experience. Referees, streamers, commentators, gfx artists, mappers, all of these roles have to be managed effectively by the host otherwise the tourney won't run smoothly.
> 
> The process starts long before the actual forum post drops as well; usually a timeline is laid out that has each and every round planned for, as well as having time set aside before each round of pools is released to make sure that mappools are of high quality, balanced difficulty, and overall just fun for the players to play.

...And what about "mappooling"?

> Honestly I could talk for hours about the intricacies of pooling, but the overall goal is to have each skillset in osu! represented as accurately as possible in terms of how many players play that skillset (for example: TONS of people play things like raw aim and streams/speed, but not very many play low approach rate reading with Hidden, and because of this most pools should have more aim than reading).
>
> You also have to pay close attention to difficulty balance too, because while Bancho star rating is actually really good for an automated system, that number that's shown isn't always accurate (I don't know anyone who would say [this difficulty of *Make a Move*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/765778#osu/1627148) is anywhere near as hard as [this diff of *Mononoke*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1280194#osu/2733296)). Because of this, a **lot** of care has to go into pooling, since too much of one skillset or another can tip towards one team or another in an unfair way.
> 
> To me it was a very intimidating process at first, but as time has gone on it's become more enjoyable than playing the game itself at times!

Have there been challenges in running 5WC that were specific to it, or have there been things to worry about that were common to many tournaments you've staffed in?

> There's always lots of challenges that arise when running a tournament, from scheduling conflicts between international teams to making sure deadlines are met in preparation for the actual matches. In terms of 5WC specifically though, one of the biggest things that you don't have to deal with in other tournaments is the sheer number of entrants.
> 
> Outside of 100k+, this is the largest rank range with a world cup, and the amount of dedicated *tournament* players is enormous, in my opinion larger than any of the other rank ranges. This year we had 2847 registrations alone, all of which were convened in one discord server and all of which then had to be directed to their country organizer to handle the tryout procedure.

What have been your fondest memories from 5WC 2024

> My favorite memory of 5WC 2024 was hearing [BlankTap](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10137131) commentate [osu! MEGAMIX](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/399575#osu/869704) as a tiebreaker in one of the first matches of the entire tournament, [#10 Brazil vs. #23 Hong Kong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzWb6NqDJg0). I had come up with the idea of using that as a tiebreaker a few weeks prior and had to do a good amount of convincing to get it into the pool.
> 
> Even though the skillset is favored towards aim in that map, it was such an intensely hype song that brought so many communities together that I thought it'd be perfect to kick off the first round of bracket because of the memories associated with it for each and every osu player around the world.
> 
> Alongside BlankTap's frankly perfect commentary and a map that came down to a 28k score difference on 2.5 million team scores it made for an insanely emotional moment that really reminds me how much I love this game and the community that comes with it <3

Where might you go from here?

> I still plan on hosting and pooling consistently! I plan on sticking around for next year's 5WC as a staff member and will also be continuing the badged [All-American Auction House](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1692273?n=1) series that has already had 2 successful iterations with the 3rd coming in June. I also plan on starting another badged international series sometime this fall with a fun gimmick that hasn't been seen yet.
> 
> I stream on twitch a few times a week, and I'm open to any questions regarding hosting/pooling either there or in discord dms, and if anyone needs staffing help for a tournament then please feel free to reach out and I'll try to help!

These types of tournaments are only possible because of the incredible osu! tournament community. It takes consistent contributions from dozens and dozens of people, ranging from playtesters to streamers, casters, referees, artists, sheeters, poolers... the list goes on and on. This admin team has a unique perspective in that we are the only ones who truly see everything from the months-long planning phase through to the end.

Almost all spectators have no idea how much it takes to run a world cup at this scale. The admin team is so thankful for the incredible staff team who helped make this happen.

We thank each player who gave it their all this year, ggwp!
