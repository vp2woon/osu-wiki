Summer is right around the corner, and these month's Loved picks are just what you need to cool yourself down.

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

Unsure what Project Loved is? Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to determine which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All the beatmaps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/contributors) of their respective game modes. You can click on the banners below for each pick to vote on the poll for that map, and there is a description underneath each banner written by a Loved captain. There is also a [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) as well if you want to view the polls directly. The voting stage lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote!

More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As always, we'd like to thank all of you who voted in the May round! Want to view the results? Check out the links below:

Millions of you have asked for it... and we listened. For this month's **first** *Popular Playcounts* pick, [TheFatRat, Slaydit, Anjulie - Stronger](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1225170#osu/2548106), mapped by [OverXon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13088868). One of the biggest titans of the "5\* Jump Training" mapping genre, which is extremely popular between newer players. With five difficulties ranging between 4 and 5 stars, so you can jump around while listening to a certified banger. The playerbase has certainly decided, with over 4 million playcount and over 2,800 favourites, that this needs its time in the spotlight. So, here we are! Do you want to see more of this Loved? Time to vote!

No matter how much time passes, it's always fun to play a [terametis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102152) map, and this one's certainly not different!

Get ready for streams, lots of them. This month's *Outstanding Oldies* pick isn't just about jumps or streams, it's about... you! The playerbase has certainly enjoyed this one, seeing how it has garnered over 300,000 playcount and over 300 favourites over the years. It's apparently a pretty popular pick in multiplayer lobbies, so hey, what do you know! Certainly a blast from the past, indeed.

Do you want to see more of this in the Loved section? Then make sure to vote for it!

⚠️ ALERT ⚠️ KING GIZZARD & THE LIZARD WIZARD IS HERE!!! ⚠️ ALERT ⚠️ THIS IS NOT A DRILL!!!

Milk and honey won't be enough for my body this time around for our latest *Small Spectacles* pick, because we've got [Gamma Knife](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1564886#osu) by the one and only [olc](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7081160)! Many of you would already be familiar the iconic beatmap [Robot Stop](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1610231#osu/3287767) custom-made for the [osu! World Cup back in 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2021) which became an instant hit sensation. *Gamma Knife* is just the same pure King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard goodness, what more could you ask for?

4 full minutes of expressive jumps and streams, varying from 192–223 BPM, you must become one with *Gamma Knife* to defeat the 7.10★. Cross-screen sliders, deathstream drum sections and psychedelic rock will have you replaying this banger over and over. What are you waiting for?

If you think you have what it takes, vote yes to see this map get Loved!

What happens when three of osu!'s most beloved mappers come together to map an epic, marathon-length song by the one and only [goreshit](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/57)? [die!!die!!cover!!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1100720#osu/2299701), this month's *Daredevil Difficulties* pick, is what you get.

Although it starts simple enough, as the song ramps up in intensity, the map follows suit. Soon, you'll find yourself barraged by tricky spaced bursts, tough slider patterns, demonic aim control, and more during its nearly six-minute runtime. At the end of the map awaits a brutal climax, pushing what little stamina you have left to its absolute limit. Despite its difficulty, though, the impressive patterning, strong progression and more combine to create a map which is an absolute treat for both the eyes and the hands, and one of my personal favorites in the whole game.

If you think you can tackle this beast of a map, make sure to vote yes to see this map in the Loved category!

HELP!! I'm trapped in a simulation and I need to name 10 2024 tech mappers IMMEDIATELY!!!

... is exactly what you'd say the moment you even glance at this map. A parallel to last month's [Call My Name](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/824872#osu/3316181) composed by [Mameyudoufu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/209), [Chirality](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1656902#osu/3381891) illustrates modern slider tech development with mappers like [funny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8473573), [arkisol](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9331411), and [Sunazuka Akira](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8846632) leading the charge. It's no surprise that this map takes the fundamentals of slider tech and brings it to the next level through even heavier slider movement, reading density, and rhythm control. Lock in for this week's *Ranked Rejects* pick as Camellia delivers yet again with another classic!

Set feels like it's missing something... Maybe a [Halgoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4109923) diff... Or a [Nines collab](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/824872#osu/3316181)... Where's [Altai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5745865)...

@EVERYONE THIS MIGHT BE THE GREATEST ASPIRE MAP EVER??????

2020's [Aspire Mapping Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-04-09-aspire-v-a-new-format) saw many game-breaking and creative maps, and [OliBombys](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6573093)' entry [O2i3 - Ping](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1235519#osu/2568364) is no exception, as this map flawlessly utilizes all kinds of wacky features from [OliBomby's Mapping Tools](https://mappingtools.github.io/). In this month's *Gameplay Gimmicks* pick you'll need to watch out for accelerating and decelerating sliders, sliders outside the playfield, sliders that teleport across the screen, and even more sliders. You can even hop into the editor and find all kinds of secrets and... dead memes? This one is reminding me of a [certain CBH map from 2015..](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/360107#osu/791636)

... anyways, although this entry didn't make the cut for Aspire 2020, you have the chance to change that! Make sure to vote yes for this map's Loved voting.

AAAA OMEDETTO OOOOO

Relive the true peak of osu! in this month's *Meme Monstrosities* with a [Spazza17](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3516241)'s classic featuring the one and only [rrtyui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/352328)! This gauntlet of a beatmap by [softhusky](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7417642) blew up in popularity after [emilia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2003326)'s [1x100 full combo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqMrXa9DTS8), which is considered by most to be the first 9★ FC in osu! history.

Although not quite 9★ anymore today, the cross-screen jumps in this short map should still pose a challenge to the greatest aim players and the mapper has since included a 10★ version as well — because y'know, the original was too easy.

Let's plz enjoy game together and give this beatmap the leaderboard it deserves!

For the first *Wildcard* of June I wanted to bring back a personal classic from the depths of 2017.

Back in 2017 when I was firstly attempting to learn alt, and really any sense of finger control, I played this map incessantly. For a long time before I became a captain I wished this would be picked, and yet once I made it I never felt it was the right moment. Seeing it being played again recently, it struck me again, and I wanted to give spotlight to the simple, yet enjoyable, magic of 5★ Meg alt.

Yes, it's [Quick Charge](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1841800#osu/3783035). Yes, this was mapped for the greatest tournament held of all time, [Aim Battle Royale](https://twitter.com/osuallstars/status/1561790519797325831). Yes, you'll probably see many aim players [come out of the woodworks](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1597068) just to upload their leaderboard score (please come back). Yes, this will probably be pinned for many across the globe. Yes, there are two diffs being Loved, one for [friends and family](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14869297) and one for the [players](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11684952) who have [sold](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5783315) their [soul](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8472976). Yes, you'll play it, and maybe you can vote Yes while you're at it.

Moshi moshi? GranDSenpai-san? Yes, it's time for more demon aim to be Loved.

How tragic is this, we are already at our last beatmap for Project Loved this month... This is so sad... Oh well... Here is the third *Wildcard* pick for June 2024, [goreshit - jeh, right](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/718974#osu) mapped by [Corim](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4242767)...? No, this is mapped by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207). WHAT? WHY? Well, I talked to DigitalHypno and he gave me a lore dump, so I'll tell you why, and much more.

Back in 2016, DigitalHypno would play his first open rank tournament (Dual Cup 2) together with Corim, and they faced the same issue that almost every team faces in a tournament — coming up with a team name. They decided to randomly scroll through song names and eventually decided to "jeh, right". DigitalHypno would then map the full song to be used as his default warmup map in future tournaments that allowed warmups, most notably appearing in the [osu! World Cup 2018 Grand Finals](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/351107784?collection=6wXsUYlKFha-lQ&t=00h16m33s) as well. (Alongside the iconic [Golec uOrkiestra - Slodycze](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/894714#osu/1869633) by [WubWoofWolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/39828) that just got loved this month!)

But this guy DigitalHypno... was obsessed with the statistics of his profile. The most well-known example would be how he spent 4 years meticulously tracking his playcount each month to form a [mirror image in his play history graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/pm2dro/digitalhypnos_playcount_graph_is_almost_completly/). But another thing you may not have realised is that despite all of his contributions to the osu! community in tournaments and Project Loved, he has ZERO FORUM POSTS!!! So the reason why Corim is the one uploading the map is because at the time uploading a beatmap would automatically generate a forum post.

I can't believe this guy... And you know what? Here are some other **jeh, right** fun facts that I can throw in just because of how much he went on. Did you know this map has a lot of patterns that were rotated 37 degrees???? That's crazy! Who is in the background? Andrew Zimmern; very interesting! And if you didn't know DigitalHypno was such a YAPPER, NOW YOU KNOW TOO!!!!!!!!!!!

Sigh... I'm tired. Just go vote for the map and let's get this month's picks over with. See you next month.

(this is a joke btw i love digitalhypno)

Despite being a new name in the Loved scene, [Vanity8](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12029122) is a player many people may recognize from seeing their maps frequently picked in multiplayer matches. [Kairiki Bear - Darling Dance (Hoshikawa Sara cover)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1376761#taiko) is one of their most popular maps, with over 2,000 plays!

This map is a good introduction to double BPM maps with 1/6 and 1/8 bursts at 153 BPM, as well as many offbeat rhythms and 1/3 sections, all tied together with effective SV which makes it very engaging to play. Give it a try today and cast your vote, darling\~! <3

Maps such as [KawaiiBass](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11992585) and [KTYN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2250574)'s (now Waribashi) [Sasaki Eri - Fuyu Biyori (Polcka Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1346344#taiko/2788245) have been synonymous to osu!taiko's Loved category for several years. Double BPM mapping with clever improvisations were long given leaderboards and a large following before they made their appearance in the Ranked section. This doesn't mean these kinds of maps are going to disappear from Loved — several popular sets sit patiently for their opportunity to be featured in future Loved rounds. This set's overwhelming popularity is the community's way to say they love the intensity and freedom the map transmits, an expected reaction considering the two household names responsible for this amazing collab.

[Gloom](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/970344#fruits/2030913) is one of the most memorable hyperwalk maps next to [Der Wald](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/406881#fruits/884085) and [AiAe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/550105#fruits/1165129) (also made by [DakkyChan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2107017)).\

[Anixto - Joker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1278881#mania) by [RuleBlazing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7312402)\
126 BPM, 2:35 | 2.22★\
*description written by [Paturages](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479)*

So last month was a bit of an oopsie wasn't it?

For those who missed it, RuleBlazing's [MAKE IT FUNKY NOW](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2085685#mania/4496289) chart was what we were going to push for last month's SV, but we realized too late that it was going for Ranked... so here's the next best candidate from our beloved, very much edible, SV veteran: *Joker*.

Mapped as an SV qualifier for the [osu!mania Asian's Championship 2020](/wiki/Tournaments/o!mAC/2020), *Joker* has a fairly simplistic yet effective concept, especially for the time. In 2020, RuleBlazing was arguably one of the most pivotal SV mappers in the tournament scene, and they have been continuously contributing and making themselves known across many tournaments. Even now, RuleBlazing's legacy still extends, sometimes even beyond the SV skillset.

The map itself has also resurfaced in popularity through its inclusion in the [first SV Summer Exhibition](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1313374). As a whole, it has an early-game, somewhat-memorization-oriented type of vibe; as such, SV learners should find it relatively accessible. As an inclusion in the Loved roster, this is yet another addition to our collection of affordable SVs for everyone to enjoy.

*Clock's tickin'*: before *time is over*, you better put your vote in. This better not get ranked as well.

*description written by [Paturages](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479)*

Since we missed out on last month's SV, we are putting a *second* one!

*Joker* being kind of a "safe" pick, we decided to go with a more daring one to contrast against it: *Sugar Rush*. As another [DJ Majokko Mirakurun](https://soundcloud.com/mir4clen) nightcore mix, it is mildly unsurprising that this would be mapped as an SV. What's more surprising, though, is that this map comes from a fairly prolific Chilean content creator: [Andere](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10157813).

While *Joker* is very friendly in terms of tournament compatibility, *Sugar Rush* is a bit less so: its approach is much more physical, especially in the main drop which not only requires a bit of jumpstream speed, but also enough focus to be able to read through the stutters. As such, *Sugar Rush* is not exactly as intuitive as it seems, even though a lot of things are normalized.

It takes a fair amount of practice to get good accuracy on it, and we expect the potential players of this map to fight hard for a spot on the leaderboard. By the laws of diminishing returns, the more you climb in terms of accuracy, the harder it gets to gain more accuracy down the line, so... good luck!

In any case, it's not often that we welcome SV mappers outside the tournament scene, and we wish for more of them to be included in the Loved roster. You can help us by throwing us more suggestions if you are aware of them on our Discord server! If you like what you see, cast your vote in the thread, or tell us what you didn't like about it!

These chordjacks are bound to fit your interest, as you're getting a whole 126 BPM deal for all your chordjack needs! While it may be fairly light throughout, the unusual chordjack patterning and heavier sections will be sure to give a fair challenge to anyone regardless of how good they are!

Still not convinced? Well, to give you a view on the quality of these chordjacks, it was used in [Speed of Light 2: Lucha Libre Edition](/wiki/Tournaments/SOL/2020) as a pick in their Round of 16 pool. Really goes to show that good chordjacks can last!

What are you waiting for? Come on down and vote yes!

*description written by [SunApple](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11817622)*

Honestly I don't really know where to start with describing how well known [IcyWorld](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1383951) truly is. Having currently nine maps (not including guest participations) already Loved, it's about time to give them the double-digit Loved count they deserve with another very well-known map of [M-A](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1520392#mania/3111694)!

For a long time I had always thought that IcyWorld mostly made stamina maps which were very difficult because of their lengths. However, this is the total opposite because its drain time is only 2:03, yet it's still able to completely drain your stamina. Let's get the obvious out the way: this map is full of jumpstreams and rolly stream patterns especially during the chorus. However, what make this map truly unique is the changing between doubles to singles constantly to create diamond-shaped patterns (or as I call them, "double oogle crossovers") which only ramps up as the density of the patterns increase in the last 30 seconds.

I think we already know that IcyWorld maps are very well liked so why not just vote "yes" already.

Many people will know [Poca](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8581031) for many things (mostly their insane acc ability for me), but did you know that they also map? Well if you were like me, you would've been a bit curious about how their maps played and maybe have played their first map that is now being nominated for Loved: [Aishite Aishite Aishite](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1808358#mania/3708644).

When first starting out on this map, you may think this is your average dump chart with a lot of awkward patterns, but instead it is something completely different. This map is very heavily focused on challenging streams that almost play like trills, as well as an abundance of staircase patterns that appear all over the place. Another thing that you'll realize immediately is the amount of trills that are present in every section, even if they are the focal point of what's happening.

With all that being said, if you want to see more Poca maps in the future, or if you just love Love LOVE how this map plays, you may want to vote "YES" right now!

Long-time charter [Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082) is returning to Loved with what is primarily a legacy pick, [FRAME](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/552855#mania/1170730).

We know just how many of you like chordjack charts, but have you really seen minijack charts? Well, dating all the way back in 2016 (or rather 2017, as it was uploaded on December 31st), *FRAME* was uploaded. It's primarily minijack-oriented with some longjacks and bursts every now and then, with the added difficulty of having very apparent hand bias for each section the chart holds, which only adds further to the inability to control your accuracy. The unique nature the chart holds puts it in no real category for what kind of chart it is, and that's possibly why it was used as a miscellaneous rice pick in the [MWC 4K 2019](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2019_4K) Quarterfinals pool, which would probably be Round of 32 nowadays. Time flies!

That said, it's still no joke to play 160 BPM minijacks, especially since the low star rating can deceive anyone. Don't get the wrong idea though, as the skill level of players now compared to 2016 has risen by so much, many are still able to challenge themselves with this classic file. Go give it a vote!

Many are familiar with \[[Crz\]Crysarlene](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5492871) due to their difficult long note charts, but we've chosen to tone it down a bit this month with [Somewhere I Belong](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/928232#mania/1938851).

Being a bit of a step-down from last month's long note pick while continuing on the same trend, *Somewhere I Belong* adds unique releases to a song you typically wouldn't see charted, all while keeping the representation at a good level. The gameplay itself has a bit of everything at once, some parts being more heavy on unusual releases with some jack-y motions, while other parts are more heavy on full inverse and coordination. All this combined got it featured in the Quarterfinals pool for [MWC 4K 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2021_4K).

It comes as no surprise why this is a fan-favorite among Crysarlene's easier charts. So for those who are looking for even more diverse music choices, more tricky releases, or just more long note charts to set a score on, go cast your vote on this!

There is increasing traction and interest towards K-pop song and culture, so this time we aim to bring that passion back to the Loved section! No better way to achieve that other than picking a 7K LN pack from one of the most renowned mappers that has gained community recognition, Flexo123! 3 years ago, the set failed the voting by a very small margin, and this time we want to push this pack again with hopes of receiving more community support.

The pack consists of 02Jam-style maps that have a diverse amount of skillsets that will help players learn more advanced LN patterning, from intermediate to upper-level difficulties! It starts out with LN density and increasingly fast and chaotic inverse patterning, but as you go higher in difficulty, you get faster patterns that demand higher amounts of coordination to execute smoothly.

It is a challenging pack, but the amount of favorites and the playcount will surely prove that it deserves its spot as one of this month's 7K picks! Make sure to help vote and support the map, so we can finally have this awesome map in the Loved section once and for all!

Jinjin's upper-level long note layering defines what we describe as a mix of various mapping techniques that test the versatility and various skillsets that keep players on their toes. This set contains mixed LN density, coordination, release and inverse, along with a multitude of different patterns that are challenging to pull off.

Do you miss the classic and nostalgic maps? This month we'd like to present to you the mapper who established their reputation in the beginning of the osu!mania era, [17VA](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1895984), returning with their old style of charting!

This chart offers a mixture of various skillsets that are required to actually pull off the patterns properly. Starting from conventional bracket chordstreams, into more technical rice patterns and denser mixed long notes, all combined with difficult SV bumps harking back to the ancient 2015 era, which will require a lot of versatility and flexibility from you if you want to actually pull it off properly.

This is a true hybrid at its finest, and only the players who have mastered all these skills will manage to get a decent score out of the map! Oh, and the mapset features an even difficulty spread that will help newer players to slowly learn the concepts and climb their way to the top difficulty!

Needless to say that this mapset deserves the spot it needs in the Loved section, and we hope you also think the same and cast your vote for this map!
