osu! players have a bit of a reputation for clicking circles with clacky keys. Thanks to our collaboration with [**The KapCo**](https://www.thekapco.com/products/osu-pippi-keycap-set), your keyboard can finally dress the part!

When osu! first released, rubber domes and scissor switches dominated the scene.

Nearly two decades later, you'd be hard-pressed to find an osu! player who doesn't use a mechanical keyboard, so it's about time we stepped up.

## Keycap set

First and foremost, [**this is a keycap set**](https://www.thekapco.com/products/osu-pippi-keycap-set). It comes with everything you'd need to fill a 100% sized keyboard, plus a bunch of extra swappable keys.

Keen eyes may have noticed that we replaced `Z` and `X` (osu!'s default input keys) with some *fancy* designs.

Obviously not every circle clicker uses `Z` and `X` though. We've included special keys for 3 different rows, so you can easily swap to match your favourite binds!

See it in action:

    </video>
</div>

(That keycap remover is included too, by the way.)

It's impossible to please both sides of *light mode* vs. *dark mode* debates. Actually, nevermind — we included `Esc` keys for both, designed by [Tanza3D](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10379965).

Sometimes circle clickers... aren't actually circle clickers, so we've also included an alternative osu!mania spacebar!

## Keyboards

If you don't have a compatible keyboard yet, **The KapCo** also offers these keycap sets as proper keyboards too!

Specifically, you can pick up either [this perfectly sized 75% keyboard](https://www.thekapco.com/products/osu-pippi-keycap-set?variant=47259204911337), highlighting [sanmu](https://www.instagram.com/sanmuworks/)'s drawing of pippi...

...or if that's too much dedication, stay stealthy with [a slick numpad](https://www.thekapco.com/products/osu-pippi-keycap-set?variant=47259204878569).

And of course, both of these come with the full keycap sets too!
