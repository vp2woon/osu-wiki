**Billx**'s bass-pounding tunes have defined nightlife — initially through shaking the walls of nightclubs after dark, but now through shaking the desks of osu! players at 3:00 AM.

Akin to our very own [Dustvoxx](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/386), **Billx** focuses on psytrance and hardcore tunes that have been proven loved by the osu! community, namely through this million-play beatmap of [Equinox](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/692910)!

**4** blood-pumping tunes have found a new home on [**Billx**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/417), all pre-timed and ready for a night of mapping.

Turn on your subwoofer:
