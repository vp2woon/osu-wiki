Music made specifically for [**TEST Open**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1889282) — a 3v3 tournament played on [osu!(lazer)](/wiki/Client/Release_stream/Lazer) — is now part of our Featured Artist library!

As ***TEST* Open** not-so-subtlely implies, this tournament was created to explore the competitive side of the new client. Its inaugural iteration had a new mappool titled "Lazer Mod (LM)", where a different osu!(lazer)-specific mod was highlighted each week.

The tournament reaches its conclusion this weekend, so there's no better time than now to showcase the 5 [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals) that were developed for this experimental project!

All of the original songs from **TEST Open** can be found on the [**TEST Open**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/420)!

Test out these tunes for yourself:
