It's not a mistake. We're really announcing **4 artists** at the same time!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/featured-artist.jpg)

Here's the situation:

Each Featured Artist announcement *usually* includes batch of an artist's songs, allowing mappers to pick whichever they prefer to map. Throughout the last few years of back and forth talks with artists and labels, there have been a few cases where we only picked up **one** song from an artist.

Today's Featured Artist additions — [**Grabbitz**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/410), [**ODDEEO**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/411), [**Pa's Lam System**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/412), and [**REAPER**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/413) — are 4 of those cases!

### Grabbitz - Way Too Deep

Here on osu!, **[Grabbitz](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/410) - Way Too Deep** is expressed by the sides of a coin:

- One side is [this extremely difficult rendition](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/383070) created by [UndeadCapulet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2523533), whose ideas still feel modern despite being nearly a decade old.
- On the flip side is [this calmer version](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/919243) designed by mapping relics [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048) and [\[Luanny\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/802909), which is newer but uses a style that *intentionally feels over a decade old*. 
- [\[Zeth\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966)'s [osu!taiko map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/888853) is what you get when the coin lands [like this](/wiki/shared/news/2024-04-06-new-featured-artists-grabbitz-oddeeo-pas-lam-system-and-reaper/coin.jpg).

If you're not into any of these maps, [download the beatmap template here](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/410/Songs/Grabbitz%20-%20Way%20Too%20Deep.osz) and make your own!

### ODDEEO + Karma Wears White Ties - Chinatown Blues \[feat. Megpoid Gumi\]

*Chinatown Blues*, the one and only retro pop song combining VOCALOID and human vocals by [**ODDEEO**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/411) and *Karma Wears White Ties*, made its way to osu! thanks to [Cloudchaser](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1576498)'s [equally retro-outfitted beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/883669).

Try that for yourself, or [design your own map with this template](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/411/Songs/ODDEEO%20%2B%20Karma%20Wears%20White%20Ties%20-%20Chinatown%20Blues%20%5Bfeat.%20Megpoid%20Gumi%5D.osz)!

### Pa's Lam System - City Lights Feat. EVO+, Jinmenusagi (Pa's Lam System Remix)

[**Pa's Lam System**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/412)'s future bass remix of *City Lights* was an early pillar of the emerging tech craze via [this Loved map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/575809) by [hehe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087) and [byfar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4674054)! A few years later, [Kukkai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7811952) contributed to this song's popularity with [a full osu!catch spread](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1486745)!

[Here's a beatmap template.](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/412/Songs/Pa_s%20Lam%20System%20-%20City%20Lights%20Feat.%20EVO%2B%20%2C%20Jinmenusagi%20(Pa_s%20Lam%20System%20Remix).osz) You know what to do.

### REAPER - HEATSEEKER

[**REAPER**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/413) REALLY LIKES TO SCREAM. THAT'S ALSO WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING WHILE PLAYING [THIS MAP OF **HEATSEEKER**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1739056) HOSTED BY... [keevy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10584295).

As fun as it may be to announce 4 artists at once, we'll be jumping back to reality next weekend with just one new Featured Artist!

Stay tuned.
