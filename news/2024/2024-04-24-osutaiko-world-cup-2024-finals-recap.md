Get prepared for the upcoming Grand Finals by refreshing your memory of the previous week's osu!taiko drum-smashing madness!

This is it. The top 4 teams have been locked in, but it is still uncertain who will be crowned as this year's osu!taiko World Champion. Will Japan secure their 10th championship in a row, or will perhaps the United States, the newcomer to the osu!taiko World Cup podium, be able to snag it away and show dominance in yet another osu! game mode?

This isn't a "baby's first osu!taiko map" mappool, and the difficulty spike compared to last week is really apparent. A new NM7 slot has been added coming into the mix, adding another techy, polyrhythm map into the pool. The maps were cut-throat, and any mistake was costly for any team.

Let's briefly look at the [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals) that were cooked up for the community, then jump straight into the match highlight for last week's round.

It seems to be fate for Taiwan and the United States to have a destructive battle every osu!taiko World Cup, and this year was no exception. In the past World Cups, these two fierce teams have met on the battlefield, mostly in the Semifinals stage. While the matches have been tough, Taiwan has had the upper hand in all of them. However, that changed this year.

With both teams having a different roster than previous years, this really was an unpredictable match. With the United States winning the roll, they picked the techy and polyrhythmic [NM7](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2166563#taiko/4570945) and, to no one's surprise, grabbed a quick point. This year, tech favoured the United States' team highly, and they heavily used this to their advantage. Meanwhile, Taiwan's team was more speed-favoured, which they showed by winning the [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2112567#taiko/4570747) right after the US' pick, and then the US' [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1901991#taiko/3921191) pick, securing them a breakpoint!

As the battle heated up, the United States decided to pick [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2166486#taiko/4570766), [Supire](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/373)'s new original track *Nebula* composed for the tournament, and managed to secure another point! The score was 2–2, and at this point the match's outcome was as nebulous as ever. This would continue until the score was 4–4, then something peculiar happened…

In previous World Cups, the matches between Taiwan and the United States hadn't been this close before, so what the United States did next shocked everyone. A tricky-to-read [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2024995#taiko/4570745) was picked, which the United States won. After that, a techy [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2078471#taiko/4352127) was picked by the opponent, which the United States also won by the slightest of margins, thereby making it one of the many breakpoints of the match. They didn't stop there though, because the [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2106820#taiko/4421005) that was picked right after, they also won.

The United States managed to secure a beautiful, but hard-fought victory against Taiwan, and for the first time in osu!taiko history, they succeeded in getting top 3! Will they manage to beat the United Kingdom in the Grand Finals to get a chance at going against Japan? Tune in next time to find out!
