Calling all 5 digit osu! players! After a long wait, the 5 Digit World Cup is back — and it's better than ever.

The 5 Digit World Cup is an annual world-cup-style community tournament for any osu! player with a 5 digit rank. Each year, team organisers from around the world seek out the best 5 digits to represent their country in hopes of winning the title of 5WC champion. In a few weeks, 32 qualifying countries will battle it out across 6 weeks of intense bracket stage competition — everyone is invited to participate and spectate each weekend!

[Last year](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1699537?n=1), we received a staggering 2,740 registrations from 69 different countries. Against all odds, Team France (#4) managed to narrowly claim **two** back-to-back Grand Finals tiebreaker victories against Team Russia (#2) in an exhausting 4-hour match. This came after defeating an incredibly strong Team Netherlands (#1) in the prior losers bracket Grand Finals match, sending them home with third place.

## Changes from 2023

[5WC 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1699537?n=1) featured lots of improvements from previous iterations, but every rose has its thorns. For everyone returning from last year's tournament, take a moment to review the following changes made in order to reduce lingering points of discomfort:

- 5WC 2024 now uses the standard [BWS](/wiki/Tournaments/Badge-weighted_seeding) formula and does not count tournament badges earned before Jan 1, 2021.
- The Qualifier procedure has changed: we now feature a pool with 14 maps at a harder difficulty target than before (now 6.5 stars).
- The Qualifier mappool will not feature a freemod map.
- This year's Grand Finals mappool is slightly more challenging at 7.0 stars.
- There is an all-new web-based [registration process](#registrations)!

## Registrations

Players and organisers will need to log in **[here](https://5wc.stagec.xyz/)** to register or manage their teams. Organisers have a new, private web interface they can use to manage their teams. Players who are selected will not know until told directly by their organiser.

Additionally, prospective players must:

- Not be restricted or hold an active tournament ban by the end of registrations.
- Must not violate the 5WC 2024 community rules in a way which warrants disqualification.
- Be within the rank range of #10,000–99,999 after the [BWS formula](/wiki/Tournaments/Badge-weighted_seeding) is applied with badges earned on or after 1 January 2021.
- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WxX2UkdSMq).
