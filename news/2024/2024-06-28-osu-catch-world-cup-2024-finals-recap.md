The mappool has reached a difficulty where a full combo on any of the maps is becoming challenging for some and impossible for many. We saw a handful of FCs on [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198816#fruits/4653147), [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198791#fruits/4653099) and [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198812#fruits/4653138).

The most picked maps in the pool this week are [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198872#fruits/4653265) and [MM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198798#fruits/4653117) whilst [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198766#fruits/4653068) and [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198875#fruits/4653272) were never picked.

The mappool selection team is treating the players this year with yet another [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals) coming out for this mappool. The Mixed Mod 3 slot is filled by [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134)'s [Neverlast](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198806#fruits/4653125), a song produced by [Aoi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/183).

## Finals results

We started the weekend on Saturday with two losers' bracket matches, where Poland, Chile, Finland and Canada fought it out to advance one match further and secure at least a top 4 finish this year.

On Sunday, Argentina and the United States faced off in the Winners' Finals, with the United States having only lost a single map in the entire tournament up until now. Argentina on the other hand has had multiple close encounters and made it to Winners' Finals being the underdogs in most of their recent matches.

The weekend ended with the winners on Saturday battling it out to reach the Grand Finals.

| Team A |  |  | Team B |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| Chile ::{ flag=CL }:: | 6 | **7** | ::{ flag=PL }:: **Poland** |
| Finland ::{ flag=FI }:: | 1 | **7** | ::{ flag=CA }:: **Canada** |
| **United States** ::{ flag=US }:: | **7** | 1 | ::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina |
| Canada ::{ flag=CA }:: | 5 | **7** | ::{ flag=PL }:: **Poland** |

Both Chile and Poland have looked very strong during this year's CWC, so the stage was set and the expectations high as these two titans faced off to secure themselves a top 4 finish. Chile is the final remaining country that has previously won the world cup, albeit this being 10 years ago already.

Both teams won their first two picks. On Chile's third pick however, Poland were able to grab their first breakpoint of the match. ::{ flag=PL }:: [trig0n](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3704228) led his team towards a very narrow 7,000 points victory on [DT4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198802#fruits/4653121). With another MVP by ::{ flag=PL }:: [trig0n](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3704228), Poland won their next pick and got into a comfortable 4–2 lead in this BO13 match versus Chile.

To make matters worse for the Chilean team, Poland was able to break them a second time. This time, ::{ flag=PL }:: [Phob](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462) led his team to a 5–2 advantage on [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198872#fruits/4653265). Backs against the wall, Chile broke back immediately with a very solid Hidden score coming out from rookie ::{ flag=CL }:: [Thaemine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/32442896) on [MM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198806#fruits/4653125). On the very next map, [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198812#fruits/4653138), ::{ flag=CL }:: [Thaemine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/32442896) produced a brilliant full-combo cutting down Poland's lead to only a single point.

Both teams won their next picks — Poland won [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198958#fruits/4653546) convincingly and Chile won [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198791#fruits/4653099) on the back of an impressive full combo from ::{ flag=CL }:: [Aryssiel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2389481). Poland is leading 6–5 and have the final pick to their disposal as well. There aren't many potential maps left in the pool, and they make the wrong choice going for [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198988#fruits/4653607). Chile secures a 6th point and give us the tiebreaker this match deserves!

The pressure on both teams is immense as a top 4 finish is on the line here. However, there is one man that steps up to the task. ::{ flag=PL }:: [trig0n](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3704228), the number one in Poland, lives up to his name and absolutely outperforms the entire lobby with a 3-miss run on the [TB](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198809#fruits/4653132). His astonishing performance helps secure Poland their first top 4 finish on the CWC stage.

### ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada vs. ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland

Canada convincingly won their match against Finland and also secured themselves top 4. As a reward, they get to battle it out with Poland which for both teams would be their first podium finish ever.

This match started very similarly to the match between Chile and Poland, as both Canada and Poland won their first three picks. ::{ flag=PL }:: [trig0n](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3704228) matched ::{ flag=CL }:: [Aryssiels](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2389481) insane full-combo on [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198791#fruits/4653099), and ::{ flag=PL }:: [Phob](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462) got an impressive one-miss on [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198874#fruits/4653271).

Tied at 3 points, Canada, the underdogs, actually got a break point against team Poland on [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198958#fruits/4653546). They also won their next pick [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198812#fruits/4653138) and went up 5–3. However, Poland won the next two picks on [MM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198806#fruits/4653125) and [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198800#fruits/4653119) to tie things up at 5 a piece.

There are two picks left — one for each team. Poland opted to go for the convert [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198872#fruits/4653265) and very convingly won this one with a score margin of over 200,000 points. Canada, in similar fashion as Poland the day before, picked [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198988#fruits/4653607). This, in the exact same turn of events, turned out to be the wrong pick as this time around Poland won it. This secures them the win, their first podium, and a spot in the osu!catch history books.
