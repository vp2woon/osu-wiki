There's a pun here about **Rocket Start** launching their career in our Featured Artists, but we'll let you work out the details.

Anyone who grew up with Nintendo will find something recognisable in **Rocket Start**'s sound. Inspired by video game soundtracks and a bunch of EDM artists like [Tokyo Machine](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/276), [Nitro Fun](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/299), and [S3RL](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/9), **Rocket Start** is the mind behind a slurry of top-tier tracks.

As of today, those tracks are officially part of osu!. 

**5** happy hardcore/electro house/upbeat bass tunes can be found on [**Rocket Start**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/400), all of which are pre-timed and *not* pre-mapped (that's your job).

*Elite Storyboarder* [Shmiklak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5504231) gathered some mappers to create a map of [Sushi Blast](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2069690) for this announcement. Take a peek at that and everything else:
