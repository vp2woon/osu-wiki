The osu!catch World Cup Quarterfinals concluded, and there are only 12 teams remaining. Let's take a look at everything that unfolded during this exciting weekend!

As we reach the Semifinals, the tension rises in this year's osu!catch World Cup — more teams are facing elimination, and matches are getting closer. We finally had the first (and only so far) match of this tournament that went to tiebreaker, breaking the curse of the 6–4 World Cup, as well as several upsets and other nail-biters.

The Quarterfinals mappool didn't change in size since last week, but it went through a noticeable jump in difficulty. With the picks diving deeper in each of their respective skills, we reached a level of difficulty that's now close to the qualifiers, in which even the most experienced rosters started to find misses on some trickier maps. Still, we saw 3 three-way FCs, two of them being on [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191148#fruits/4634642) by Belgium and Argentina, and one of them on [MM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191260#fruits/4634910) by Poland. Despite the mappool being significantly harder than the previous years at the same stage, players are improving and becoming more and more consistent, raising the standards for the CWCs to come.

Teams had different approaches to the pool this round, as each pick was played at least 5 times, with teams relying the most on [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191179#fruits/4634727) and [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191189#fruits/4634741), the more conventional and comfy picks of the pool for players used to tournaments.

The osu!catch enjoyers were also spoiled this week, with no less than three [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals) in the mappool. It is a first for the osu!catch World Cup, which at most had two in last year's Grand Finals week. All three of them are of very different styles, so make sure to give them all a listen!

## Quarterfinals results

The matches this week were quite exciting, as even the teams who had an easier time in their first match in the losers' bracket had more difficult matchups in the second ones, and some podium contenders for this year faced in the winners' bracket, resulting in several close matches.

You may notice "-1" coming up sometimes in these tables. It just means that the team forfeited for whatever reason, allowing the other team to win by default.

## Match highlights

### ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland vs. ::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina

If there is one Quarterfinals match that I would recommend everyone to watch, it would be this one.

Poland and Argentina are two teams that never met in CWC prior to this encounter. However, they share a common trait — they are both teams that have improved tremendously in recent times, and that are aiming to get their best results ever this year. Since the roster reveals, most people have been expecting to see at least one of these two teams make it to the top 3 this year, and even have the potential to compete in the Grand Finals. Because of that, this was a very hyped matchup, and it clearly did not fail to deliver.

Both teams started by picking maps that you would expect from these rosters — Argentina, being the country with the highest ranked core roster in the tournament, opted for the faster and more difficult mechanical picks of the pool, such as [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191189#fruits/4634741), [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191178#fruits/4634726), and [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191172#fruits/4634714). As for Poland, they abused their strength in HD and unconventional maps, going for [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191197#fruits/4634752), [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191180#fruits/4634728), and [MM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/114207882), which they even three-way FC'd.

Both teams did not struggle with the difficulty of the pool, making this match about consistency over a skill advantage, which is why a solid pick strategy was important for both teams. Unfortunately Argentina made the first misstep of the match on their fourth pick — they went for [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191179#fruits/4634727), one of the easier maps in the pool, but Poland prevailed, with an FC from ::{ flag=PL }:: [trig0n](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3704228), the only one in the lobby and his 4th FC in a row at this point in the match (he would even end up extending that streak to 6 in a row). Poland had now secured the very sought-after breakpoint they needed to win the match, but still needed to win their next two picks. [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191165#fruits/4634690) and [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191148#fruits/4634642) were picked and secured for respectively Poland and Argentina, leaving it to a 5–4 scoreline for Poland.

Poland had to make a tough call with their last pick, which would grant them the win if successful. It would end up being [MM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191184#fruits/4634735), which backfired as Argentina managed to crawl back from this very dire situation and even out the breakpoints, resulting in a 5–5 scoreline. This meant that we finally got to see the [tiebreaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191190#fruits/4634742) being played for the first time this year, and by two of the strongest tiebreaker rosters. After a very hard-fought battle, Argentina ended up clutching out the win by around 70,000 points, with an amazing 1-miss score by ::{ flag=AR }:: [-Story-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8172283).

Poland, the #2 seed, was now in the losers' bracket, while Argentina secured themselves a spot in the winners' Semifinals. The recap can't really do this match justice, so I would strongly advise you to go and watch it yourself if you haven't!

### ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada vs. ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

The last time Canada and Chile met in CWC was in 2021, and it was quite the encounter. The match went to tiebreaker and Canada ended up winning 7–6 in the Semifinals, eliminating Chile of the tournament. Both of these teams have had a rough CWC run last year, respectively finishing top 8 and top 12, lower than the previous couple of years. These two rosters this year have the potential to go way further in the tournament than last year, and they're clearly eager to prove it. This time around we got to see them face off in a very heated winners' bracket Quarterfinals match, with a guaranteed top 6 placement on the line.

The match started out strong — the first three picks were back-to-back breakpoints, with two of them being in favour of Canada. They were not intent on keeping up the streak however, as they would win their next pick, [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191172#fruits/4634714). That wasn't the case for Chile though, who would end up losing their third pick in a row on [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191165#fruits/4634690). Now looking at a 4–1 scoreline in favour of Canada, it seemed as though the match had rapidly slipped out of Chile's hands. Canada only had to win one more pick to secure the tiebreaker, and it was their turn to pick, while Chile had to win five maps in a row to avoid it, which they wanted to since Canada was known to be a very strong tiebreaker team. It really looked like it was too much to ask for... or was it?

Canada chose to go for [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191179#fruits/4634727), but despite an SS from ::{ flag=CA }:: [sularis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14571181), Chile would end up getting their first point in the last four maps, thanks to a solid team score and an SS from ::{ flag=CL }:: [Aryssiel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2389481). Chile then went for [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191164#fruits/4634684), and got the best team score of the week on it by far, 270,000 points ahead of the second best. Now riding the momentum of the previous two maps, confidence was rising in the Chilean team. On their turn to pick, [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191155#fruits/4634667) was chosen, but despite a very close finish at the end, it would end up being successful for Chile. They had now won four maps in a row in a miraculous turn of events. Canada settled on [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191178#fruits/4634726) as the last pick of the match, but Chile prevailed, with another SS from ::{ flag=CL }:: [Aryssiel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2389481), ending the match on a five maps win streak to win 6–4.

Thanks to that win, Chile secured themselves a spot in the final 6, a result that they didn't achieve since 2020. Canada, on the other hand, will still be competing, and I'm sure are determined to make the most out of that losers' bracket run.

### ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan vs. ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2167799363&parent=osu.ppy.sh&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Japan and the United Kingdom are both teams that we've rarely seen access the later rounds of the tournament in recent years. Japan managed to reach them last year for the first time since 2018 before being eliminated and finishing at top 12, while the United Kingdom never made it past the Quarterfinals and the final 12 (at least since the introduction of the losers' bracket in 2015).

This year though, these two teams are looking better than they have for a long time, and are looking to beat their previous results. Japan, looked very promising from the very beginning, getting 8th seed in the qualifiers. As for the United Kingdom, both their rookies and veterans seemed to have improved a lot recently. Both teams were sent to the losers' bracket in the previous week, but ended up winning their first Quarterfinals match convincingly, 6–1 against Sweden, and 6–0 against the Netherlands. Now meeting in an elimination match, one of these teams would end their CWC run here, despite their desire to keep on going and show what they're capable of.

Right off the bat, we see back-to-back breakpoints, setting the tone for an intense series. For the following picks, both teams would exhaust the mod brackets they're known to be strong at — Japan would go on to pick and win [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191178#fruits/4634726) and [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191244#fruits/4634876), with ::{ flag=JP }:: [Molqus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1927193) getting his second FC on DT3, a repeat of his earlier performance against Sweden. The United Kingdom would do the same but with the Hard Rock pool, securing points on [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191172#fruits/4634714) and [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191179#fruits/4634727). Now that both of these mod pools were exhausted, they had to try something new.

It wasn't an issue for Japan though, who seemed to have the edge on Hidden, and would win their next two picks once again, on [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191180#fruits/4634728) and [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191164#fruits/4634684). The United Kingdom would go for a [MM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191260#fruits/4634910) pick which worked, with a beautiful No Mod FC from ::{ flag=GB }:: [Matt_H](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4067115), to even out the scoreline at a 4–5 on their pick. They deemed [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191148#fruits/4634642) to be their best option left. With nerves getting into play, backs against the wall, the United Kingdom unfortunately couldn't beat Japan on the consistency pick and ended up losing the match 6–4, with another impressive performance for the Japanese captain and veteran, ::{ flag=JP }:: [Molqus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1927193), FCing once again.

With this, the Japanese roster reached the Semifinals and the top 12, replicating their performance from last year in a difficult bracket. The United Kingdom though will see their CWC2024 run come to an end here, but with their best result since 2019. It is genuinely the best British osu!catch has looked in a long time, and I'm sure these guys will be back next year even stronger.

We are now entering the later stages of this osu!catch World Cup, with all the top placements still to be determined in matches that are sure to be very exciting. As usual, you can find all the details on the [wiki page](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2024), so be sure to check out the schedules and tune in to the streams on the [osulive Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) for the Semifinals!
