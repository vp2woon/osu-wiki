Bops, slaps, and jams are the 3 cornerstones of **YonKaGor**'s musical output. By definition, that means they're required to be one of our Featured Artists!

Musical cat **YonKaGor** has been designing original tunes and music videos for the better half of a decade, and while they're not what you'd usually expect from a rhythm game, that's where they've ended up!

**5** of those bops and/or slaps and/or jams have been delivered straight to [**YonKaGor**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/406), all packaged in recycled cardboard and pre-timed beatmap templates.

Witness them for yourself through these previews and a video simultaneously showcasing the new hitsounds on osu!(lazer)'s default skin *argon*:

And of course, another Featured Artist is on the docket for next week!

Stay tuned.
