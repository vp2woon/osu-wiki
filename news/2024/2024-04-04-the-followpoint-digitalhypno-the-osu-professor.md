Welcome or welcome back to The Followpoint, a "community spotlight" series where we interview various players and community figures to get to know them better!

Today we are joined by DigitalHypno (a.k.a. honmi), a long-standing tournament player also known for their video content about osu! and contributions to Project Loved, Beatmap Spotlights and the osu! tournament scene in general.

Let's get right into it!

---

*Let's start off with an introduction, how would you introduce yourself to people who don't know you?*

> I started playing osu! in 2014 and have since become known as a long-standing tournament player, having played in the osu! World Cup for the United States in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021.
>
> I was an active tournament host and staff member for many years starting in 2017, most known for hosting [Hippo Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1864006) and [Suiji Spring Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1305570) alongside [this1neguy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1797189). I was also a [Loved captain](/wiki/People/Project_Loved_Team) from 2018 to 2023 and have been a [Spotlights curator](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Spotlight_Curators) since 2020.
>
> I also started actively posting osu!-related YouTube videos in 2021, ranging from livestream highlights to osu! game shows to a 100-episode osu! Let's Play series.
>
> I've been a bit less active lately as I'm focused on making a new YouTube series, which I'll talk more about later in this interview.

*How did you get introduced to osu! and what was your first impression of it?*

> I first came across osu! through *League of Legends* livestreams. At the time, many streamers would play a few osu! maps while waiting in queue. At first, I thought it was just another random queue game and didn't think much of it.
>
> One night in particular — May 11, 2014 — I was watching a League streamer play osu!, and the chat was going absolutely crazy over the streamer's performance. I thought to myself, "This game doesn't look *that* hard", and I made my osu! account that very same day.

*What is the story behind the symmetrical play count graph in your profile?*

> I love this story. In early 2018, I was playing a lot of ScoreV2 in multiplayer, which didn't add to your play count at the time. This was around the time the new osu! website added play count graphs, which, unlike the old website, allowed you to see the exact amount of play count you got each month. In June 2018, I was looking at how I had an abnormally low play count in the last few months compared to the months before. I was thinking about what my graph might've looked like once I started gaining more play count again, and then I got the brilliant idea to mirror my graph completely.
>

>
> To make sure I ended each month with the right amount of play count, I just played normally until the last few days of a month, at which point I would gain a lot quickly by retrying maps over and over. osu! has a minimum score requirement for a play to count towards your play count, so it wasn't as simple as just spamming the retry button. I mostly did this "play count farming" in osu!catch, since lower-star maps in that game mode don't require as much physical strain or focus as other game modes, which is important when you're trying to gain over 1,000 play count in one sitting.

*Before we move onto questions regarding player improvement and tournaments, what made you change your nickname from DigitalHypno to honmi outside osu!?*

> 혼미 (honmi) is a nickname I created when registering for a language exchange app because I wanted to use a name that fit well with Korean phonetics. Soon after, I realized that the name also worked as a username when written out in English.
>
> I tend to gravitate towards usernames that are both distinct and short, so especially after I realized that the name honmi was available on most platforms, I started using it more often.
>
> Rest assured, my name on osu! will always be DigitalHypno. I don't mind being called honmi, Hypno, or Habib, which is my real name.

*Do you believe the hardware we have access to today has reached its peak, or do you think people are able to develop better tools for easier and faster improvement?*

> As always, it's hard to imagine how new hardware will impact the community. Who could've predicted [rapid trigger's widespread adoption in the osu! community](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-12-22-how-advances-in-technology-affected-the-osu-community#rapid-trigger-(2021)) even 5 years ago?
>
> That said, I do think we've reached a point where the bottleneck to a player's performance truly is their actual skill rather than their hardware. I can't imagine any changes in the hardware meta that would change this fact, but we can check back in another 5 years.

*You've got a lot of badges from tournaments. What made you start playing tournaments, and would you encourage others to start playing tournaments as well?*

> My first tournaments were all ones that my friends invited me to play. At the time, I didn't really know much about how tournaments worked, let alone where to find them. I later learned that tournaments are all posted in the [Tournaments forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/55) on the osu! website, and I would definitely recommend anyone to sign up for at least one tournament in their time playing this game.
>
> Even if you don't make it far, I think tournaments are among the most fun and memorable experiences this game has to offer. If you think your rank isn't high enough, there are tournaments for all rank ranges, even 6 and 7 digits. If you don't know who to play with, most tournaments have a "looking for team" channel in their Discord server where you can find teammates.
>
> Within my first year of playing tournaments, I realized that they were much more fulfilling to me than grinding for new top plays in solo. I wanted to play as many tournaments as I could, which segues us into your next question.

*Do you feel like derankers have made tournaments less enjoyable for everyone involved?*

> This question is tricky, but the short answer is that I think derankers (players who, for one reason or another, choose not to set new top plays despite having the skill to do so) go against the fundamental idea of rank-restricted tournaments. The reason I say it's tricky is because I think the competition in rank-restricted tournaments has adapted to the fact that they exist, so the fact that there are other derankers for the derankers to compete against likely makes it more enjoyable for them.
>
> My story is that when I started playing tournaments, I was around rank #1,800. I was invited to play some "4 digit" tournaments (which have a rank restriction around #1,000–#9,999) with some friends, and back then, it was common for rank-restricted tournaments to remove you from the tournament if your rank was outside of the rank range. This led to people waiting until after the tournament ended to set new top plays. During one of these tournaments, I decided to play as many tournaments as I could, which I realized is actually done by staying just under rank #1,000, as this gave me access to both 4 digit tournaments and open-rank tournaments.
>
> As I became a competitive player in open-rank tournaments, I definitely became one of the most infamous derankers for many years. Along with the rest of the community, though, I definitely recognized the issue. I think the whole point of rank-restricted tournaments is to allow for a more level playing field for players around those ranks, but the problem was that while tournaments were seeded based on solo rank, solo rank isn't based on tournament performance at all.
>
> To help solve this problem, I designed a seeding system in 2018 called [Badge-Weighted Seeding (BWS)](/wiki/Tournaments/Badge-weighted_seeding), a seeding formula that artificially increases your rank based on how many tournament badges you have. Tournament badges come from winning or placing well in tournaments, so the idea is that the more badges you have, the more likely it is that you shouldn't be playing in rank-restricted tournaments anymore. Despite not being a perfect solution, I believe it solves a lot of the problems that used to exist.
>
> I think the real solution would be an official tournament [Elo ranking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), ideally tied to some "solo queue" system that's built into osu!lazer. It might just be a pipe dream of mine, but I'd love to see that be implemented one day.

*In your opinion, has the tournament scene evolved positively or negatively in recent years, and why?*

> As someone who started playing tournaments in 2016, it's tempting to reminisce on how tournaments used to be, but I can confidently say that the tournament scene has overall evolved in a very positive way.
>
> Along with BWS, a big example I can point to is how No Fail used to not be used in tournaments. It's funny to think about now, but back then, the community believed that if you failed the end of a map and didn't recover (read: if you [notelocked](/wiki/Gameplay/Judgement/Notelock) on the last pattern), then no matter how well you performed on the map, your score should be completely nullified. 
>
> I credit myself as being one of the first people to truly question that belief. I have memories of talking to the host of every tournament I played and trying to change their minds, including the host of Corsace Open. Even now that No Fail has been standard for many years, the idea of "failed scores not counting" is still something I joke about with friends.
>
> There are some other, more polarizing changes in the tournament scene, such as "slot pooling" (mappools where each map covers a very predictable skill set, such as the first No Mod map being aim and the second No Mod map being streams), but overall, I think the tournament scene has really found its footing in the last few years.

*In the future, do you think it's possible for osu! tournaments to become mainstream esport events?*

> It's absolutely possible, especially with recent developments such as the [Tournament Committee](/wiki/People/Tournament_Committee), a group of seasoned tournament staff members that work to improve the quality of osu! tournaments, and people like [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691) who are always finding ways to take competitive osu! to the next level.
>
> BTMC is someone I have a lot of respect for, and I commend his dedication to pushing osu! to mainstream frontiers. With him at the steering wheel, I think the future looks bright.

*To finish things off, what does the future hold for you? Do you have any goals for the upcoming years that you'd like to share, or is there anything else you'd like to mention?*

> I'm currently inactive on osu! as I'm working on a new YouTube game show series called Social Circle. Inspired by [The Genius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Genius_(TV_series)), Social Circle is a last-man-standing strategy game show where 13 players play a series of strategic, social, and psychological games, eliminating one player per episode until only one remains. It's played in *Minecraft* using proximity voice to simulate a real-world environment, but the strategy games themselves do not involve *Minecraft* mechanics in any way.
>
> The players are all from the osu! community, with a wide mix of personalities and some familiar faces. It'll be at least a few months until it comes out, but I'm sure it'll be worth the wait. Please check it out when it's released!
>
> I'm sure I'll be back to playing osu! more regularly one day. This community will always feel like home to me, and as with most people who have been around here long enough, I'm forever indebted to this game for all the people I've met and all the experiences I've had. Thank you for the interview!
>
> My final words: Go play [osu!lazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/download)! It's much better than you might think.

*Bonus question: can you cook a steak?*

> The winner of mangomizer vs BTMC can face off against me.

For the three people who are out of the loop regarding who this "BTMC" person mentioned here is, you'll probably want to read [his interview](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-03-13-the-followpoint-btmc-the-face-of-osu). More likely though, if you're out of the loop regarding this "steak" business, [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B6TyWML0zg) (and its comment section) may clarify that.

Thank you to DigitalHypno for joining us and answering these questions, and thank you for reading — I hope you enjoyed!
