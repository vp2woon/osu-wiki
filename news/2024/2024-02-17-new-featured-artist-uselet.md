A new batch of breakcore has landed on our doorstep thanks to our latest Featured Artist: **uselet**!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/402/header.jpg)

Many musicians enjoy seeing their music in osu!, but [**uselet**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5256300) has taken that a step further by [mapping a bunch of their own tunes](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5256300#beatmaps). While they're primarily an osu! player, their songs have seen the most traction in osu!taiko so far, namely via [circus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1329329) and [cxvbiopxvcbn](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1742153).

**11** tunes — including all of those above — are up for grabs on [**uselet**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/402). (That's your cue to click the link.)

In case you're not in the *mapping mood* quite yet, this video of **uselet**'s *circus* should set the tone appropriately. Check that out, plus a few more previews:

Fun fact: any of the 11 beatmap templates you download from [**uselet**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/402) are already pre-timed. Less fun fact: I timed 11 songs yesterday.

That'll do it for this week. Stay tuned for another artist release in about 168 hours.
