VOCALOID lovers rejoice! The Vocaloid Mapping Contest returns bigger and better than ever, featuring support for every game mode, an improved format, a bit of necromancy, and incredible music from our brand-new Featured Artist: **iroha(sasaki)**!

![](/wiki/Contests/VMC/2/img/banner.jpg)

Yep, you heard right. **iroha(sasaki)**, the artist behind the legendary VOCALOID classic *Meltdown* featured in *many* classic osu! maps, is now a Featured Artist (and the 400th one, no less)!

*Meltdown* has already earned its place in osu!'s history with several popular Ranked maps, including [Diasios](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25999)'s [early map of *Meltdown*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/9070#osu/36814) from 2009, [ertyukjh010](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/220939)'s [map and unique storyboard](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/45672#osu/142590) from 2012, and even more recently [ohm002](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4468239)'s [modern marathon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1743736#osu/3564761) from 2022!

Regardless of how popular *Meltdown* may be, it's far from **iroha(sasaki)**'s only song — we're happy to announce that **11** songs are part of [**iroha(sasaki)**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/399)!

***BUT WAIT!!!*** This is more than just a Featured Artist announcement!

## Vocaloid Mapping Contest 2

The [**Vocaloid Mapping Contest** (***VMC***)](/wiki/Contests/VMC) returns, and just like last time, it's all about spotlighting hidden VOCALOID gems!

The last contest blew our expectations out of the water. **39 new maps** were created for never-before-Ranked songs from some of our VOCALOID Featured Artists. You can check out the results [here](/wiki/Contests/VMC/1)!

Fuelled by the excitement and passion generated by that event, we couldn't help but return for another round. And this time, with the knowledge we gained, we've set our sights on making it nothing short of extraordinary.

The mission remains unchanged for this contest: choose one of the incredible songs listed below and create a VOCALOID beatmap that will stand out above the rest. It's hardly an accident that this Featured Artist and contest announcement are combined — the VAT (Vocaloid Appreciation Team) scouted **iroha(sasaki)** as a Featured Artist for the very purpose of featuring their work in this iteration of the contest.

In **iroha(sasaki)**'s own words:

> I am just one person who loves music. That's all. It would be more than enough if I can help the "osu!" content flourish, even if only in the shadows.

But we didn't stop at simply featuring **iroha(sasaki)**'s amazing music. We realised that this contest demanded a judge who truly understands the essence of VOCALOID mapping. Who better to join our judging panel than the extraordinary mapper of many osu! classics like [Kakuzetsu Thanatos](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/76396), **[NatsumeRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/151679)**!

Want to participate? Here's what you need to know:

### The big changes

We greatly appreciated the feedback we received regarding the last contest.

We're happy to announce that this contest is open to all **osu!**, **osu!taiko**, **osu!catch**, and **osu!mania** mappers! Our dedicated judging panels for each game mode are looking forward to seeing your work.

- [osu! contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/199)
- [osu!taiko contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/200)
- [osu!catch contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/201)
- [osu!mania contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/202)

We're also revamping the format to ensure that each entry receives high-quality feedback that meets our standards. Instead of having our judging panel give scores and feedback for every entry, the **judging panel will only judge the top 10 entries**. A team of equally qualified mappers will serve as [screeners](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening), and will filter submissions down to the 10 best maps.

**Any entries eliminated by the team of screeners will still receive feedback**, but from the screening team instead of the judging panel. This way we can give everyone, from newer mappers to experienced mappers, tailored and valuable feedback and advice they can benefit from.

\**Screening will only occur in modes with a large number of entries.*

### Prizes

What would VOCALOID be without its mascots? For a contest featuring **iroha(sasaki)** songs sung by Kagamine *Rin* and judged by Natsume*Rin*, the first-place osu! winner will receive a *custom VMC Winner Kagamine Rin plushie* handcrafted by none other than [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323)!

| Placing | Prize(s) |  |
| :-: | :-- | :-- |
| 1st place | Custom *VMC 2 Winner* VOCALOID plushie\*, 6 months of osu!supporter, [*Elite Mapper* contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points), *VMC 2 Winner* profile badge | ![](/wiki/Contests/VMC/2/img/winnerbadge.png) |
| 2nd place | 2 months of osu!supporter, [*Elite Mapper* contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) |  |
| 3rd place | 1 month of osu!supporter, [*Elite Mapper* contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) |  |

\**Prize only for participants of the osu! game mode, due to its one-of-a-kind nature.*

This contest is created by and for vocal synth fans to promote music, artists, and mappers. **All mappers who participate will receive constructive feedback from experienced mappers in the community.** That's arguably a more valuable prize in its own right!

### Songs

As proven by this contest, great things can happen when we promote and support the artists who make osu! great.

Below we have selected 5 of **iroha(sakaki)**'s incredible works to you to pick from that were appropriate for contest mapping, and we're confident that something will inspire you!

### Rules

- **Submissions must use one of the [songs from the selection above](#songs).** Cut versions are not allowed.
- **Submissions must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Beatmaps should abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes (such as an accidental off-screen object), submissions that contain intentional unrankables (not due to simple error, such as sliderator) will be disqualified. Mappers will be notified if this occurs.
- **Submissions must not be publicly revealed until after the results are announced.**
- **Excluding metadata, submissions must not include anything that could reveal your identity.** Metadata will be anonymised before submissions are relayed to judges and screeners.
- **Collaborations are not allowed.** This is a solo contest.
- **Submissions must not include storyboards or videos.**
- **Your submission must not have any edits to the `.osu` file that would not be possible through the editor.** This isn't Aspire. You are permitted to change any difficulty settings, backgrounds, green lines, SV, hitsounds, etc.
- **Your submission must have only one difficulty.**
