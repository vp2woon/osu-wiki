**Akiri** makes their debut as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/401/header.jpg?1)

From [osu!mania player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19587411) to full flavour music producer, **Akiri** is the mastermind behind a new wave of grandiose aural creations (also known as cool music).

And as of today, **48** of those songs are officially part of our Featured Artist library! Check out the previews and pre-timed `.osz` files for *every song* from [**Akiri**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/401).

You might've already heard **Akiri** through this year's [osu!mania 7K World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_7K), where they had **2** [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals) reveals! Check out their extra fancy tiebreaker reveal from last week (featuring [Symphony Of The Lost Souls](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2130621)), along with everything else **Akiri** has to offer:
