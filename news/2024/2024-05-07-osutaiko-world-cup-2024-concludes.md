And your osu!taiko World Cup champion is...

![](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2024/img/twc2024-banner.jpg)

Japan. It's Japan. By now it has become a meme that the osu!taiko World Cup champion is known even before the tournament starts, but Japan have earned that reputation fair and square. Shedding blood and tears every year in order to maintain their dominance isn't an easy task, and for the 10th year in a row they managed to uphold their 1st place on the podium.

## Summary

![](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2024/img/twc2024-podium.jpg)

Congratulations to Japan for securing their 10th consecutive osu!taiko World Cup victory, and congratulations to the United Kingdom and United States on their 2nd and 3rd podium spots respectively!

While there isn't much to say about Japan for the 10th year in a row, an interesting thing to note about these podium placements is that this is the first time ever that the podium is shared by 3 different continents!

## Grand Finals recap

### ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom vs. ::{ flag=US }:: United States

After the Finals week results I'd bet you a pretty penny both sides of the pond were quivering in their collective... let me just check Google... 400 million boots at the thought of this match. The United Kingdom has had a taste of the podium back in 2020, but they're finally back with the team that got them there *and more*. Last time they got 3rd, would they go the extra mile now?

The United States on the other hand are in a *state* (haha) of euphoria after achieving their first ever top 3 finish despite participating in every TWC to date. They've already made history, so... why not make some more, right?

The United States decided to go all in and opened with [BilliumMoto - 100 Carat Smoke Point](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2170025) but that sadly backfired, with the United Kingdom grabbing a breakpoint as well as an extra on [Memme - Acid Burst](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1048233). A rough start, but being in the Grand Finals is no fluke, as the United States quickly stepped back into the ring with a win on [ikaruga_nex - ultimer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1761945). Things steadily progressed until we eventually found ourselves in a "back-to-back-to-back" osu! original streak (yay!)! The United States grabbed [katagiri - c0pyf0x](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2169957), but the United Kingdom claimed both [DJ Raisei - Fractured Heaven](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2169918) and [BilliumMoto - Stained Satin](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2170035).

The score was now 5â€“2, which is admittedly not great. But as any tournament veteran knows, it's not over until it's over. The United Kingdom took an *extremely* narrow win on [MK & RoughSketch - Stereo Beasts (Original Mix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2169935) after an early note lock. The United States laid claim to [Nanodesu - Libera Lotus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2169909) with an incredible team performance. And the last map... the last map really can't be explained in writing. I urge you, I *implore* you... You know what, I *demand* that you check out the VOD. If not for the entire match, then just to know what I'm talking about.

Though if I cannot convince you, know that the United Kingdom did indeed end up victorious. Although at this point, it's safe to say that they're all winners. The United States gave us one last "hurrah" with a spectacular match to send them off, and for the United Kingdom it is coming home a little greater than last time. The two teams have not only made history for themselves, but for TWC as a whole! For the first time ever, we have not one, but *two* western teams on the top 3 podium.

## Interviews

Here you can read what some of the people involved in this tournament had to share about their perspective.

::{#cansol}::

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-05-07-osutaiko-world-cup-2024-concludes/Cansol.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/407)

> Hello, everyone. I'm Cansol, a composer from South Korea!
> 
> I'm majoring in classical music, and my goal is to make more creative and entertaining songs crossing between electronic and acoustic, which is based on my major.
> 
> You can find me in some known rhythm games such as Lanota, Dynamix and KALPA, and I've also been featured in AD:PIANO VIII in collaboration with another FA, [Raimukun](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/247).
> 
> If I were to recommend a song that represents me, I'd choose '1,2,3,4! Overclocked Edition'. (You can find this song in the FA list!) This song is rather long at over 7 minutes, but it's a mix of many genres, and it also displays my maximum ability when I was composing it!

[Cansol](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/407), who composed [Train of Thought](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2155531#taiko/4543467) for the Round of 16 tiebreaker, had the following to say.

[**You can find the Korean version of this interview here.**](https://gist.github.com/Walavouchey/e080dda5040b74a16b412fd6b2e3f3e5)

---

What was the train of thought behind *Train of Thought*? What kind of concept did you initially have for it, and did it evolve in any way during the production process?

> Since I started composing it not long after being discharged from military service, I wanted to write a song that could candidly express the feelings I had while serving in there! I spent a while thinking about what kind of concept would fit the feelings, and then I discovered the expression 'Train of Thought'.
> 
> I thought about the two meanings of 'Train of Thought' and applied them to the song.
> 
> First, I focused on the 'flow of consciousness' part.
> 
> However, that's not to say I just composed whatever happened to come to mind; rather, I pondered how I could take this simple idea and apply it in a way that's interesting, fits well, and can express the concept. In the process, I even drew inspiration from the saying 'lose one's train of thought'!
> 
> Second, I focused on the 'Train of Thought' in its literal sense.
> 
> This shows in latter part of the song, where I either created melodies inspired by the sounds trains make or adapted vibraphone melodies heard in South Korean subways.
> 
> Although I couldn't know the musical atmospheres of subway systems in all countries, I felt that the vibraphone was the proper instrument since I figured it's often used for conveying a feeling of comfort in songs found in everyday life.

Were there any specific considerations regarding the song's style due to constraints of osu!taiko gameplay?

> When I was composing, I felt like I might have been putting in a bit too many notes, so I asked the staff members "doesn't this part sound a little too confusing?" midway through the process.
> 
> But they said that it was okay, awesome even, which gave me the confidence to express what I wanted to.
> 
> One thing is that I thought the drum sounds were important for impact since the taiko and the drum are the same percussion instrument. I thought, there's no way they put notes on every single drum sound in the drum solos, right? But when I looked at the final beatmap, not a single drum sound was skipped.
> 
> I think I underestimated the players too much (haha).

What are your thoughts on the song's [accompanying visuals](https://assets.ppy.sh/beatmaps/2155531/covers/raw.jpg)?

> As I mentioned earlier, the song takes inspiration from trains, so I told the designer that I wanted the visuals to resemble subway route maps.
> 
> And when I saw the drafts, the visuals not only fit what I'd hoped for ideally, but they were even more beautiful than I thought, so I was really pleased!
> 
> The most surprising part is that the graphic designer filled in all the station names. There are a lot of fun elements like the current station labeled as Cansol (me), and there's also [Panthullu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12580298)'s bakery (the designer).
> 
> Despite me not requesting this level of detail, the designer still gave so much attention to detail, which I was extremely grateful for.

Do you have artists that you often take inspiration from?

> It's hard to answer because it's always different depending on what I write.
> 
> At the time when I was composing 'Train of Thought', I was falling in love with jazz playlists.
> 
> If I were to focus my answer on artists that influenced me at the time, I'd say that the rhythm game artists that influenced me were [NIWASHI](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/228) and [Sobrem](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/338), and some other artists that influenced me were [Kapustin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Kapustin) and [The 8-Bit Big Band](https://www.youtube.com/@The8BitBigBand)!
> 
> I think these artists all have their own unique and distinct style, so I really like them.

What is your favourite rhythm game song?

> You may already know this one, but these days, I really love '[Synthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOP7G5J755s)' by [tn-shi](https://www.youtube.com/@tn-shi)!!
> 
> It's filled with sections that are delightful to the ears, and its restless melody is so exciting to listen to.
> 
> Especially in the final buildup, I think the part where the key changes unexpectedly and the last chorus really feels like the ultimate finale is super cool!

::{#r_j}::

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-05-07-osutaiko-world-cup-2024-concludes/R_J.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6490509)

> I'm RJ, I've been playing taiko for about 5 years now and this was my 4th Taiko World Cup.

[R J](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6490509), or the United States team captain for this year's world cup, together with their teammates, took the country to the podium for the first time ever at 3rd place.

---

Did you have any expectations going into the tournament?

> Yes, at the start of the tournament I believed that our team was the best version of the team since I began playing in 2021. So of course I believed that we could make it further than I personally have gone before, especially given that other previously strong countries were playing without some of their key players. My confidence in myself may not have been the highest it's ever been, but I had a lot of confidence in my teammates.

What do you think might have contributed most to the United States' first podium placement this year?

> Cheddar 2 lbs. More serious answer is how dedicated our team members have been too improving as players in the last year and how motivated we were towards getting a podium placement. Every member on the team was dedicated towards our goal of reaching the podium which I think only served to fuel our motivation even more.
> 
> The addition of [SilverTyrant](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14356353) to the roster this year and the return of [Miniature Lamp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9821194) really elevated our team as they both have reached a point where they can compete at a high level. They are cracked. Also, shout-outs to [Xok](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12177903), they played in TWC 2020 after which they completely changed playstyles, grinded it out, and got good enough to participate again 4 years later, but also cheddar 2 lbs. If we didn't spam that before every match then who knows, maybe we busted out in semis/finals again :)

While you've played in the TWC before, how did becoming the team captain come about?

> Nothing too interesting, honestly. We have changed who has been captain nearly every year recently, and this year I asked if I could take a turn (I really wanted to be the captain for the US team at least once.) I have captained for teams in other tournaments before, so it was a familiar position for me to be in.

How did you prepare for matches and TWC itself?

> TWC is a tournament that is all about discipline. You have to be in a certain mental and physical state where you're both willing and able to practice daily for more than a month straight if you aim to get a high placement.
> 
> Avoiding burnout can be tough, so you must have the determination to give it your all every week. I think achieving that state of mind is different for everybody, so I won't go into specifics. As for the matches themselves? One hour of warm-up and a dose of cheddar 2 lbs. Perfect recipe for success.

Are there any specific moments you remember the most vividly?

> Winning the match vs Taiwan to secure a podium position is a memory that I think will remain for a long time. We all wanted it so badly so to finally get it felt both extremely rewarding and relieving. Definitely gonna be chasing that feeling every TWC after this one, but I don't think anything will feel quite as good as it did this year.

What was the first thing you did after the tournament?

> I just soaked it in. This was my 4th consecutive year playing TWC and every year we had aspirations for a podium, only to fall short. Finally achieving it even just once makes all the past failures seem worth it, however the grand finals mappool showcase happened shortly after our match against Taiwan, so it was quickly back to focusing on the match ahead of us. We were happy with a podium but definitely wanted more.
> 
> We failed this year to achieve a 2nd place finish but now it's a new goal for us to work towards. The run back next year will be ðŸ”¥. It's hard to be too upset about losing the losers finals match to a team as deserving of the placement as the UK. Nothing but respect for them.

---

> I just wanna mention, give taiko a try! Or catch, or mania, or standard (rare). You might learn that it's the right mode for you. I used to be a standard player then tried playing taiko one day for no real reason 5 years ago and haven't looked back. Our community is active and welcoming towards all players regardless of skill level.
> 
> And finally, thank you to all the players and staff who participated in TWC this year and to every one who supported their favorite team!
