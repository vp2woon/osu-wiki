It's about time **takehirotei** joined our Featured Artist collection.

> What if I compose a song, map it on osu!, then play it myself?

Tons of osu! players have shared this thought, but [**takehirotei**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11793794) is one of the few who actually made it happen.

Kickstarting a musical career through [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals) across the tournament scene, **takehirotei** has come far enough to land a well-deserved spot in our Featured Artist library!

**8** tunes have set up camp in [**takehirotei**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/428), where they'll live until the heat death of the universe.

Never heard **takehirotei**'s music before? That's about to change:

Some of **takehirotei**'s songs change BPM quite a bit, but fear not: every song is available as a pre-timed beatmap template on [**takehirotei**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/428)! Being lazy can't feel more rewarding than this.

The only thing better than **takehirotei** is **takehirotei 2**. We'd rather not spoil you too much though, so we'll be running with a different musician for next weekend's Featured Artist reveal.

Stay tuned.
