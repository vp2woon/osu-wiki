Here's to another year of Project Loved!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

With a new year comes another year of Project Loved picks made for you.

For those of you who are new to what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to determine which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the beatmaps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/contributors) of their respective game modes. You can click on the banners below for each pick to vote on the poll for that map, and there is a description underneath each banner written by a Loved captain. There is also a [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) as well if you want to view the polls directly. The voting stage lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote!

The process for picking maps may differ between each game mode. For more information, please visit the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh/submissions/mania).

As is par for the course, we would like to thank everyone who participated in last month's voting. If you would like to view results from December 2023, please visit the links below:

Huh, why does this song sound familiar to me?...

Sporting a playcount of over 600,000, our January pick for Popular Playcounts is [Chizu-Kun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10288461)'s beatmap of [Kobaryo - Bookmaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1231048#osu). While the song has been popularized by [some dude's map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1189978#osu/2479479), most players who have reached out to the dude in question mentioned the fact that they were aching for an easier difficulty so they could also enjoy the song, as not everyone is able to play a 9.15â˜… map. Fear not, Chizu-Kun has arrived!

This mapset of *Bookmaker* contains not only a 7â˜… difficulty for you to properly enjoy, but also a couple other difficulties, down to a 4.88â˜… difficulty mapped by [takehirotei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11793794). As you'll certainly notice, the beatmap does not lose in style, and its quality is certainly deserving of the huge popularity it has attained over the years. If you think this beatmap deserves a spot in the Loved section, now's the time!

What do you get when three of the most legendary mappers of their time meet up to tackle a classic song by a renowned composer? I mean, it's probably going to be good, I don't know. Maybe great. Maybe even better? Actually, yes.

Here's [DJ Sharpnel - Mmmmmmm](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/336272#osu), mapped by a team of none other than [Natteke desu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1848318) (otherwise known as EvilElvis or Jounzan), one of the most acclaimed mappers of all time; [Reiji-RJ](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/305389), one of the pioneers of the "Russian mapping style" back in 2011â€“2014; and [caren_sk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/542498), one of the paragons of the Loved section. You've certainly heard of at least one of them, and oh boy, that's not even mentioning the song. This is a classic by all definitions.

Get ready to see Elvis and Reiji's recognizable and fun style clash perfectly with caren_sk's jumpy madness. Four and a half minutes of jumps, bursts, and patterns that highlight how brilliant these three are when mapping together. If that's what you want to see in the Loved section, make sure to cast your vote!

[Car Seat Headrest - Beach Life-In-Death](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1352473#osu) by [SwagRoxas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11962943)\
115 BPM, 13:12 | 8.23â˜…\
*description written by [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)*

This month's Small Spectacles pick is certainly an alternative one. [SwagRoxas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11962943), previously known as dreamteamrox115, has always been a mapper of songs outside the mainstream, and this is no exception.

[Car Seat Headrest - Beach Life-In-Death](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1352473#osu/2799976) â€” both song and map are quite distinct. Perhaps that's why it hasn't attained a huge playcount over the years, but what it lacks in playcount, it certainly shows in its favorite count. This beatmap is certainly a trip, a thirteen-minute trip to be more exact. Wacky sliders, creative patterns, and a sense of flow like no other.

You can definitely describe this map in a lot of ways, and that's because of how much content it has. Don't let the length of the song and the difficulty stop you â€” this is certainly a trip worth packing your bags for. The effort put into this certainly shows, and it has been one of the prime examples of the artistic mapping style pioneered by mappers like [squirrelpascals](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6151332).

Are you eager to see more good songs with unique maps being showcased here? Then don't forget to vote on this â€” every vote counts!

The first Daredevil Difficulty pick for 2024 is [BarkingMadDog](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3475189)'s take on [AZKi - Fake.Fake.Fake.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1743421#osu/3564083)

What a way to open up the new year isn't it? A 10â˜… pure mechanics test by [BarkingMadDog](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3475189) â€” it's a dream come true for most high-end players. This map does not let up as it features the pinnacle of high-spacing jumps and triples at 255 BPM for nearly 4 minutes.

If this goes through, anyone who comes out on top of this incredible skillcap test will be considered to be the best hybrid player in *my* eyes.

Give this your vote if you want it to enter Loved! I'll leave you with a classic to guide your adventure with this map.

D rank: Strong Survivor\
C rank: Proud ~~Stream~~ Aim Master\
B rank: True Champion\
A rank: Legend above Legends\

One of the first Wildcards to start off the year is [Villdjack](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3880134)'s map of [sawawa - Fire in the Phoenix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1306775#osu/2709349).

[Villdjack](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3880134) makes a return to the Loved section!? You might have seen this map in the iconic ["mrekk Vaxei WhiteCat vs The World"](https://youtu.be/OWMIFazYvaQ?si=kehE2YjnQIFNxbvm) as the first map. Since then it has definitely gained tons of traction, and deservedly so! Villdjack does an amazing job with this one. This is mostly a 196 BPM unrelenting flow aim test (**8.61â˜…** is no easy feat after all), but don't let your guard down as this also has 1/3 jumps at the end! I feel like this song is represented really well while also being extremely fun to play.

Want to see this map enter Project Loved? You decide!

With the song boasting hundreds of millions of views on YouTube, it was inevitable a popular map of this song would exist.

If you're looking for a chill experience, this map has got you covered! Don't let the star rating completely fool you though, there are some tricky rhythms to catch you out if you're not paying attention...

Those of you present in the tournament scene will already be *very* familiar with this map, but for those of you who aren't: [Koe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1884351#osu) is an insanely challenging aim control / alt map originally made for [OWC 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2022). Since then, it has been used in countless community tournaments and has continued to be a staple map in many high-star pools.

Assuming this map hasn't already scared you from losing it in a tournament match, go and give it a play and vote yes if you enjoy it!

[Ending with a rough Loved voting result of 65.40% 6 years ago](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/684558?n=1), I believe this is one of the maps that really needs a second chance. Taking what Toy said, cRyo delivered a 4â˜… K-Pop map that is absolutely delicious for players of all skill levels. It's very simple yet so good; a combo that is frequent in cRyo's maps. And come on â€” you can't really go wrong with a cRyo\[iceeicee\] map, can you?

Rated mapsets are the kind of sets where no matter the quantity of them, taiko players will always be willing to tackle those challenges over and over again. You only need a high-energy track, a great combination of mappers, and the result will be a mapset with over 6K plays. [ler1211](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19901680) and [KawaiiBass](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11992585) are 2 mappers whose faces are very familiar in the community, so entertainment and replay value on their creations are guaranteed.

The amount of love this mapset has received would make Project Loved be renamed to Project Hatred if we decided to just ignore it, so let's start the year the right way, doing the right thing. Give [Slax - Lovesickore](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1774900#taiko/3634501) some well-deserved love!

There's no better way to start the year than giving yourself an excuse to buy a new keyboard. [Camellia feat. Nanahira - Super-Fast-Internet-San](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1173057#taiko/2446551) by [Salieri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11233651) is a map that will make sure to put your old keys into an eternal rest, giving you that perfect excuse you need. This mapset even has a rated diff, for max keyboard smashing efficiency.

It also seems to be a rather popular pick, with a whopping 8K+ plays. Truly a benchmark for both taiko players' skill and their keyboard's resistance. Giving it a leaderboard to add to the competitive aspect would be the cherry on top. We at Project Loved can give you the possibility to choose, but it's your decision, so go give it a try. Just make sure the keyboard you are using doesn't explode immediately.

Creative mastermind [HiroK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4050738) makes their way back into the Loved voting with yet another amazing map!

For those that haven't seen the [3TWC](/wiki/Tournaments/3TWC/1) Grand Finals back in 2021, *Pluripotency* is a crazy 2-minute track giving mappers lots of opportunities to create an outstanding map, and HiroK totally nailed it.

The map starts off rather calm, but soon enough, you'll instantly get thrown into the deep end with some high-SV finishers and a tech section. If that wasn't enough of a challenge for you, there will be some nasty SV streams waiting for you in the second half of the map.

This map has the ability to challenge a very wide skill range, so if the nomod FC was too easy for you, I recommend you try it with some mods ðŸ˜‰

[Noctalium](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6488167) comes back to the Loved section with yet another end-game map. This time we have a stamina-based jump map with multiple wiggles, hyper wiggles and extended big-distance jumps with only one break in the middle. This map has four uprates, so every tier of player can be challenged and even try to overcome the seemingly impossible 1.4x and 1.5x difficulties. Good luck to everyone who gives this map a try!

[notapplicable](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7170536) is notorious for his maps that focus on SV, and since 2022, he has been making some noise in the osu!mania World Cup mappooling scene. One of the maps that certainly helped his popularity in these kinds of maps would be his take on [IOSYS - Marisa wa Taihen na Mono wo Nusunde Ikimashita](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1062298#mania/2224393).

Featured in the [osu!mania 4K World Cup 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2021_4K) Quarterfinals mappool, this pick favors players who are more inclined to the memorization aspect of SVs, as this throws everything at you including teleports, long notes that you have to hold carefully, varying scroll speeds from slow to ridiculously fast, and numerous stops that you must be aware of. Not to mention, this map also requires you to be very precise with each hit, as this has an OD of 8. In general, this really tests your ability to play a map with different variations of SV all throughout it. It'll definitely require a ton of practice, especially if you are not familiar with the song or map.

Do you really think you're one of the best SV players in the tournament scene? Maybe you want to see how your skills have improved since the last time you've played these kinds of maps? Then don't hesitate to give this map a positive review, and your vote in order to ensure this gets into the Loved category.

Longstanding charter [0DZ0](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28156707), better known as [DarkZtar](https://www.flashflashrevolution.com/profile/DarkZtar/) within the FFR community, makes their long-awaited appearance to the Loved section with their chart of [Naruto's Ninja Way](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1671839#mania)!

Now, before you say anything, yes. I do realize how out there of a song choice this is. Albeit a bit silly, you really shouldn't let it stray from the fact that this file is just... really solid. While it's existed on the servers for just about two years now, rates were added later down the line when the tournament [Speed of Light 3](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1686361?n=1) used it on 1.2x for their Quarterfinals mappool.

Of course, this chart was used for a good reason with an extremely solid use of 1/8 bursts for dubstep representation, and 1/6 jacks alongside other similar burst-y patterns for vocal representation. The added longjacks that persist throughout the harder parts also lead to something that feels a lot more responsive when it comes to song representation, which is a change in direction for the people who struggle with high-BPM minijacks. (I'm always watching, "minijack-world-cup" people.)

I implore anyone who hasn't tried this to give it a play. You WILL enjoy it. In all seriousness though, go give it your vote and help spread the early days of adding lyrics over remixes of popular media.

Good morning chordjack fans. This month, we're taking a minor step back in terms of difficulty, as we're bringing you [Fanahira](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7415829)'s chart of [Back! to the Future](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1316855)!

This chart got the majority of its popularity from the [Compulsive Chordjack Collection 2](https://etternaonline.com/pack/99938) pack on *Etterna*, being one of the most played in the pack (which consists of 207 different charts)! Unsurprisingly, the numbers on osu! back this popularity up well, and for good reason.

With the base rate starting at 120 BPM, you're given something that isn't too heavy in density, which is nice when considering a lot of our recent nominations have been for a higher level of players. That's definitely not to say that these players are still excluded, as the set has rates up to 168 BPM.

Naturally, I'd fit in a "Jack! to the Future" joke here, but the diff name did for me. Instead, I'll just resort to telling you to vote. Please vote.

[Xingyue](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9614083) is back for their 3rd appearance in Loved. This time, instead of one of their well-known chordjack maps, we will be seeing another one of their maps. This month, [Bluenation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1926113#mania/3977176) takes the spotlight!

This map is an absolute gauntlet of stamina, well-known on both osu! and *Etterna*. It features all the patterns that a good stamina map may have, such as jumptrills, handstream, and jumpstream. However, the most prominent pattern is the abundance of split trills found at 180 BPM (or 252 BPM if you're crazy enough to play this on 1.4). After nearly five and a half minutes of stamina-draining patterns, players will truly never feel the same once the chart is over.

Whether you're a fan of these kinds of stamina maps or if you just appreciate how catchy this song is, be sure to vote "yes" below!

This pack, which was compiled by \[[Crz\]hinako1804](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13747903), has already brought in lots of various maps in the jumpstream category with their [\
Jumpstream Complexes Vol. 2A](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1595301). But now, another one of their packs titled [Technical Complexes Vol.1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1240175) is being added to the candidates of this Project Loved wave!

Technicality is such an important aspect in VSRGs in general. osu!mania is certainly no exception, with its importance in being able to hone your skills as a physical player, and especially your ability to play in tournaments. What is to be expected in these maps? Well, there are certainly a lot of grace notes, rolls, and minijacks, in the middle of having numerous jumps and hands.

These mixtures of patterns in a single map help the creators express themselves much more, and make difficult maps while having a lot of time signatures to consider. However, they would pertain to a much more difficult map than a more straightforward one, as unlike those kinds of maps, you really have to make sure that you are staying on beat while still being able to hit the difficult patterns.

Not to mention, this pack also gives you a different set of challenges per map. Some maps are short like [Rinjuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1240175#mania/2578357) but have so much difficulty all throughout the map, and that kiai section is one not to be taken lightly. There are also maps like [Sunset Tea Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1240175#mania/2578359), which is one of the maps with a lower star rating, yet definitely makes up for the difficulty with its length of three minutes. Overall, there's just a variety of technical maps in store for you with this pack, as well as a lot of surprises laying in wait!

Do you want to discover more about the realms of technicality that this pack offers? Well then, better give it your "yes" vote NOW!!

With the improvement of LN players worldwide, many have sought to push the limits of LN density to another level. As a result, [TheFunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13981991) is here to fulfill the desire that LN lunatics have with [Lunatic Eyes \~ Invisible Full Moon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1888601#mania/3889550).

Featured in a wide variety of tournaments, this map has tested the reading capabilities of many high-end players. Even though the patterning itself is a bit more straightforward than many other maps, this doesn't necessarily make the map easy in any way. We see 2 minutes of constant density at 200 BPM and many sections where you have to hold down one finger while the density continually ramps up around it.

On top of all the already mentioned details, players will be able to prove themselves with the uprates of the map, which go all the way up to 1.35. At this point, the map's difficulty increases tenfold; instead of 200 BPM, you will be playing 270 inverse handstream.

If you enjoy seeing these types of charts going into Loved, don't let your opinion be invisible, and vote "yes" below!!

Prepare yourselves. This month features two completely insane boss charts designed to test even the greatest players.

First, we have our rice boss pick. This is a chart of [Quark no Umi o Oyoide](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1371992#mania) by none other than [dressurf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/758406)!

Few charts are willing to go as far as challenging people with **304 BPM chordstream**. This chart requires an amount of stamina very few people who play keyboard VSRGs can say they have. Of course, there are lower rates if you have a skill issue (like me) and need to downrate the chart to be able to play it to any respectable degree.

It's rare to see charts of this caliber in difficulty appear in Project Loved's news posts. If you want to see more of this in the future, definitely be sure to support dressurf in the Loved voting. This chart is absolutely not for the faint of heart, and we mean that.

In contrast to our rice boss pick, we now have an O2Jam-style boss pick. This is a chart of Camellia's [ANOMALY](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/588965#mania), a collaboration between [Cuppp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2345293) and [Entozer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/277044)!

This was actually quite popular back in the day. You would see many top-level players post scores of this on video-sharing websites. Even now, you still see the same thing.

This chart throws everything at you in the kitchen sink. For many, even passing this is an achievement (mind the HP 8.5). For some, getting an S is an achievement. For a select few, even that somehow isn't enough.

With that said, this is an iconic chart, and we feel the community is finally ready for this chart to be Loved. It has also been a significant amount of time since a chart with involvement from Entozer was nominated, so make sure to support both Cuppp and Entozer if you want to see this moved to the Loved category!

Personally, I've become pretty sick of waiting to nominate this. It's finally time for [Arona](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8748664) to return to the Loved voting with their chart of [Kawaikute Gomen](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1907694#mania)!

This is not nearly as difficult as the other two 7K picks we nominated this month. With that said, this chart definitely took off in a hurry in terms of popularity. It's easy to see why: this is one of the most satisfying charts to combo in the game for me. This has excellent dump charting and it's downright *fun* to play.

If you are not familiar with this chart, then try it out, and you will see what I mean.

While this is a different kind of pick than Arona's previously nominated set of [DJ Sharpnel - KLASSIKER EINHEIT](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1419209), this is absolutely a warranted nomination, and we hope you agree with us.
