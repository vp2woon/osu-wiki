In 10 years, you can tell your friends you were here for the rise of **DeBisco**, our latest Featured Artist!

American producer **DeBisco** has been on his musical journey since 2005, gradually building a name for himself in the underground electronic music scene. Games like *God of Rock*, *BoomBox*, and *Dance Dash* have already featured **DeBisco**, and osu! is officially joining that list today!

Until the end of the universe, **7** tracks are here to stay. Here, of course, refers to [**DeBisco**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/422).

Witness some of **DeBisco**'s music in action (with some [osu! keycaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-05-27-osu-keycaps)):
