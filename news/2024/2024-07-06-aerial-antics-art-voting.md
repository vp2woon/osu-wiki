It's time to lock in your **15** votes and decide the fate of **133** stellar entries!

**133** talented artists from all corners of the osu! community have made their call for this contest, and now it's *your* turn! Dive into the sky with our mascots and choose **15** of your favourites to dive right into the main menus of every osu! player community-wide.

In case you're having a hard time wrapping your head around all these fabulous entries, we've compiled all of them in a neat slideshow with tunes from one of [Project Prism](/wiki/Tournaments/Project_Prism/2024)'s original tracks, [NormalM feat. Echo - Resonance of Viscerharma](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2199177)!

As always, the voting will be open for **7 days** from the time of this post, so make sure to cast your votes before the skies clear up and the contest closes!

And of course, a selection of the top-voted finalists will make it to the main menu and receive 3 months of osu!supporter, not to mention that the top 3 will also receive fancy bespoke profile badges cropped directly from their own creations, alongside having their entries featured for everyone as a limited-time selection of default profile banners!

Many thanks to all participants who dedicated their time and sweat into creating and submitting an entry — you're the lifeblood of this contest, and all art enjoyers in our community are eternally grateful!

Okay, what are you waiting for? Vote, vote, vote!
