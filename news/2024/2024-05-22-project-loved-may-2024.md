Project Loved. Picks. Votes. You know the drill.

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

For those who are perchance unfamiliar with what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to determine which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the beatmaps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/contributors) of their respective game modes. You can click on the banners below for each pick to vote on the poll for that map, and there is a description underneath each banner written by a Loved captain. There is also a [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) as well if you want to view the polls directly. The voting stage lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote!

More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

Per tradition, let's take a moment to thank all the participants in the voting for the April round! If you'd like to view the results from the previous round, visit the following links:

The Popular Playcount for this month is [QuadroKiller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7552072) & [Fl4ndre Scarlet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4146243)'s [Various Artists - Corner Jump Training](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/478917#osu/1406018).

Corner Jump Training. Do I have to say more? Last month we had Stream Training, this month we have Jump Training. This is one of the most iconic jump training sets in the game. With a staggering 3.6M+ plays and more than 1K favorites, everyone's tried this set to improve their aim. This mapset is filled to the brim with difficulties ranging from *Orange Heart & Neptune - Mousou Katharsis* at 3.73★ all the way to *DM Ashura - deltaMAX* at 10.29★. All jump lovers from all skill ranges are able to enjoy this.

Give this map your vote! It will definitely be one of the most contested aim maps with a leaderboard if it gets Loved.

Here comes another Outstanding Oldie story from grandpa Mismagius!

Once upon a time, a map took an in-game chat channel by storm. People were left shocked, there were no words to be said. The ones that could speak, spoke of "ascending". There was even a player, a "Brazilian Jesus" as he would be known later, who certainly did ascend to a better place after playing this beatmap. Word got around, and top players were enthralled by this great beatmap. Before uttering his famous "plz enjoy game" words, it's said that a certain Japanese top player was seen playing this map with Double Time. Of course, no such records exist, as is the case with any legend.

Legendary as it is, [\[Luanny\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/802909)'s beatmap of [Dope Arcade - Ascension (MitiS Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/110954#osu) is here. If you were around in the early-to-mid 2010s osu! mapping scene, you'd see [Luanny\]'s EDM maps all around — [Open Window](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/100628#osu), [Till It's Over](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/139415#osu), and others were a staple in multiplayer matches for years. Now, it is time to take this not-so-hidden gem and put it on the spotlight it deserves.

There's a reason why this beatmap has gotten overwhelming support on the Loved website. It's certainly one of a kind. Definitely a map that transforms right in front of your eyes. Good luck!

The first Wildcard for this month is [Millesimale](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11783312)'s map of [Juan Luis Guerra - Las Avispas](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1852791#osu).

Una mapita ma' para mis Dominicanos. A Dominican classic. osu! needs more merengue, what a banger.

50+ favourites, 12,000+ plays, 8.15★. It's very rare to find a song where the jumps are represented so well by the map, it's impressive. [Millesimale](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11783312) pulled this off perfectly. A 3-minute long pure consistency aim test with great structure, all while jamming out to the Dominican homemade bachata by the iconic Juan Luis Guerra. Such a fun experience.

Give this your honest vote and try not to find yourself grooving to the song while you play it!

HELP!! I'm trapped in a simulation and I need to name 10 2019 tech mappers IMMEDIATELY!!!

... is exactly what you'd say the moment you even glance at this map. Fan favourites like [Nines](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2696453), [Halgoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4109923), [Ambrew](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7803396), [Altai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5745865), and many more are here to bring you a crazy assortment of light tech maps at your disposal. It's especially incredible how each difficulty manages to bring their own unique style and take on "tech", and having it all in one song displays just how capable these mappers are. It's an absolute tragedy that this month's *Ranked Reject* pick had an incredible lineup for [Mameyudoufu - Call My Name](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/824872#osu/3316181), but we here at Loved hope you're still able to enjoy this masterwork of a craft.

This month's ~~*Wildcard 3*~~ **NM2** has been brought by none other than Canada's greatest alt player and badge thief [bad boy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3545323).

Exhilarating 220 BPM spaced streams at a 8.5★ level alongside some simple jumps that pretty much any player can handle will bring great fortune to your future mappools! Please ignore the "NO MOD 1" in the description... I'm sure it's a typo since it's not like any actual aim player can play this map. Alright, jokes aside, bad boy delivered, perhaps, one of the most hype aim-consistency maps of all time — whether it's the incredible song choice, addicting patterning that distinguishes his style, or even the background choice, [SURVIVE (CUT VER.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1779388#osu/3644151) is here to deliver as another great aim challenge for No Mod skillcap players.

Remember to vote with your phones using hashtag #Corsace for VINXIS to finally come back to the game!

May's *Chill Champion* pick is [Red Velvet - Psycho](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1083022#osu/2265313) hosted by [Chibitania](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3441472)! Sitting at 4.98★ and 140 BPM, this map offers a tapping-heavy approach to the song with streams and bursts making a very nice map to practice your tapping consistency on. *Psycho* might be a bit on the harder side when it comes to *Chill Champions*, but if the top difficulty is exhausting you then make sure to check out the more aim-oriented Insane or lower difficulties that offer a more laid-back experience.

This map has been collecting almost over 300K plays and 390+ favorites in the Graveyard, so if you agree that this map deserves a leaderboard, then head to the thread to cast your vote!

From the era of *Brain Power* mashups, this 37-second beaut eventually found its way into [Deppyforce](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5286213)'s hands, who went on to create a true masterpiece. While the top difficulties might be slightly over-mapped, the absurd level of challenge just adds to the humor. All this while Syaro screams and is *chased by a rabbit...???* The culture surrounding anime in 2016 was truly a sight to behold.

[ryza](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1171628), previously known as Silynn, has produced some of the most popular charts in Loved category.

The charm of extremely difficult unranked maps from pre-2016 has always caught my eye. They might not be the most well-crafted, but I find myself filled with childish wonder as I play through them. One of my favorites is [Truly Truly Love](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/97595#osu/955615), also by ryza. Now, I'd like to welcome a new map, [Hidra Heteromycin](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/461164#osu/987724). This slightly awkward, low-BPM spaced-stream galore is hard not to love. If you're like me and enjoy these uncut diamonds from the past, check it out, and maybe even vote yes to get another map into the Loved category!

IT'S CLEAR WHY THIS MAP ORIGINATED AS A CUSTOM FOR THE [2022 OSU WORLD CUP](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2022), AS IT IS A TREAT FOR BOTH MAPPERS AND PLAYERS ALIKE.

THIS MAP IS ABLE TO MASTERFULLY BLEND ELEMENTS OF AIM CONTROL, FINGER CONTROL, READING, AND YOUR ABILITY TO COUNT... WAIT WHAT?

If these two names with this SR don't fill your fingers with fear and terror, I don't know what will.

As expected, you'll be tested in typical Firce and tasuke fashion: hard, uncommon patterns and bursts with some extreme dense sections at best.

With three difficulties in the upper 6★ range, one from *7_7* themselves as well as [Waribashi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2250574)'s *YN Month* and the [TWC2022](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2022) QF HD2 pick *The TWC Daily!?!?!?* from [Lumenite-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6256027), this set isn't for the faint-of-hearts!

[owl\*tree feat.chi\*tree - *Valsqotch*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1395252) is a familiar map to veteran players, being featured as the Free Mod 2 slot in [TWC 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2021). While most may recognize the mapper [hoku](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9503098) for their comfortable and fun speed maps, here they showcase another side of their mapping skills with an exciting swing song! In addition to a lively 1/3-filled rhythm, the map mixes in plenty of 1/6 and even 1/4, making the map a complex and interesting challenge that is satisfying to play. As the difficulty name suggests, you should give this map a try today and feel your fingers flutter to the beat! ^-^

There seems to be a lot of excitement in the community about stream maps lately, and this month I'm going to introduce a set of maps that are fascinating and high BPM!

[YONEDA - KAERU](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1977658) is stream mapset created by [KawaiiBass](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11992585), with difficulties available up to 300 BPM. A wide range of players, from intermediate to advanced, can practice stream patterns, which is the current SR meta!

Without a doubt a recognisable map to modern tourney players, [Rish feat. Choko - Take](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1955326#taiko/4049810) mapped by [\_gt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8301957) is up for this month's Loved vote! 🎍🎍🎍

*Take* was used in the first week Qualifiers for [TWC 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2023), given the chance to be seen and practiced by plenty of people from all teams, it is also more accessible compared to other difficult gimmick maps! \_gt handles the task of easing players into the craziness of gimmick maps incredibly well, using several types of barline and slider gimmicks in a seamless, easy-to-understand and very fun way! *Take* is also unique due to the song using several bpm changes, adding a rhythmic challenge that has been sparsely seen elsewhere in gimmicks, especially in lower-star maps!

All in all, *Take* is a great and engaging gimmick map for those just starting to learn gimmicks or for those who can't get enough of the madness gimmicks offer. Give it (a few) tries and see how you do!

Another classic CS 0/CS 1 map from [Vincs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2026299)' memoir. This iteration has a lot of wide-spaced hyper wiggles that require a lot of speed. Balanced by the fact the circles are so big, the hit window is really lenient. Even if you aren't the best at BPM control, you should be able to find plenty of enjoyment in this map. As for the PRO players, there is a CS 1 difficulty to further test your SPEED. Good luck my friends.

A very classic map from a very classic tournament. Not only was this map created for a mapping tournament, but it has also been used in a lot of tournaments due to the its flexibility in many specific tournament slots. The competition was fierce for this iteration of the mapping tournament. All difficulties managed to provide good experiences that stuck with many players for years. Hopefully you enjoy it as much as the tournament mappers and players did.

[Phob](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462) entering the Loved section for the first time with his map of CustomiZ's [COOLEST](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2091345#fruits/4383343), this map features a unique approach to song expression and rhythm through many unique sliders, uncomfortable dash/walk patterns, and various widescreen notes. Due to the way this map plays, it has a lot of potential to be challenging with various mods. It can even be a challenge for experienced players on no mod. I hope anyone who gives this a try will enjoy this different approach to mapping.

*description written by [Silhoueska Elze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

[OpakyL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4521780) is notorious for creating some of the most loved and really difficult jack files out there, which were featured in packs like the [Compulsive Chordjack Collection](https://etternaonline.com/pack/85125). That being said, let us introduce their first beatmap nomination in the Loved selection with [Panda Eyes & Teminite - Highscore](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/681593#mania/1441118)!

Being a chart that's 4 minutes long, stamina will certainly play a huge factor in how you'll be able to execute the patterns. While they may seem lenient (though dense) at first, especially with the BPM on the base rate, the length certainly will give you a lot of fatigue, with how most of this chart contains a lot of jacks that can range from your typical dense chordjacks to even some longjacks thrown into mix.

Not to mention, there are also a lot of long notes in this chart as well, along with some audaciously placed long note jumptrills/splittrills throughout. These sections could really make your accuracy drop a lot if you're not careful, so you better watch out!

Faster rates were also added to the chart, so if you think you need more of a challenge, then those rates would certainly be for you. If not, there is luckily a slower rate for you to practice and hopefully iron out all of your weaknesses in each section.

Overall, jacks and long notes. What else could you really ask for considering today's meta? Do you think you have what it takes to play this with pristine accuracy? Might as well give it a shot, and of course, give this beatmap a favorable vote.

[LeiN-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2162939) certainly has a huge reputation for their maps being used in numerous tournaments all across the globe, and with that in mind, featuring one of his charts to be nominated for Loved, [Ukigumo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/291778#mania/656901)!

This chart starts off a very tame section until you reach a stream, followed by a few minijacks. Once you perfectly execute that part, immediately, you are thrown lots of jumpstream patterns, and it gradually gets harder as the map progresses. It may be a bit easier at the start, but eventually, you'll be seeing more and more hands that could really give you a run for your money, especially with some of them being borderline splittrills, and even handstreams for a few sections. Thankfully there are breaks in between, but you'd still have to play the song efficiently to not lose too much stamina.

By the very end, you'll be greeted with a ton of splittrilly jumpstreams, which could really be a challenge for your wrists, so be wary of pushing them too far!

Are you ready to take on the challenge? Do you want to see how you stack against the rest of the world? Then don't be afraid to give this map your positive review, and support [LeiN-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2162939) as they increase their arsenal in Project Loved!

With the number of Spanish speakers in the osu!mania community it is no wonder why these kinds of Latin American songs are super popular in our community. This month we will be seeing the return of [Ska](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10313023) with [Me Tengo Que Ir](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1719905#mania/3514861)!

This is probably one of the "easier" Ska charts that exist, however, that doesn't mean that you can play this on autopilot. Due to the nature of Ska's iconic mapping style this is, as predicted, chock full of vocal dumps which make you feel like you are singing the song with your keyboard. One of the key features of this map is the streams which sway back and forth, and especially if you aren't too used to these kinds of patterns can be very difficult to be able to predict and play. Even though the length is quite long, at its 4-minute 38-second drain time, this map features quite a few breaks for when you are on a good run and need some time to relax.

With the amount of difficult Ska maps that have been Loved, we wanted to be able to give less physical players a chart to be able to play, so they can also enjoy the high-quality dumps that Ska provides. If you want to see more Spanish songs or Ska maps in Loved, be sure to not leave just yet and vote "yes" on this map.

[Camellia - NIGHTMARE CITY](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1034509#mania) by [AlexDunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9194799)\

*description written by [SunApple](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11817622)*

[AlexDunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9194799) is most well known for two things, SV and hard hybrids, and their map of [NIGHTMARE CITY](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1034509#mania/3200775) shows off both of those attributes incredibly.

To start off, the first thing that many players will notice is the length of the map since it's one of the longest maps by AlexDunk, and as a result, players will have to play a little bit of every type of pattern. With that being said there is an emphasis on streams and trills throughout this map, but with it being a hybrid-style chart there is definitely no lack of tricky LNs scattered everywhere. Finally, the most defining feature of this map is the SVs that are present in the "SV JUDGMENT" difficulty and WOW are those SVs so satisfying to hit and to be able to read.

This map is insanely popular and for a good reason, it really includes all the most fun patterns for players to play in a map. If you want to see AlexDunk get their third map into Loved or if you just have played and enjoyed this chart in the past then be sure to vote "yes"!

[John Coltrane - Giant Steps](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1592995#mania) by [Davvy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10047413)\

It truly does not get any more deceptively trickier than this.

[Davvy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10047413) is no stranger to charting some noticeably irregular songs you'd never expect to come across in osu!, and their chart of [Giant Steps](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1592995#mania) is perhaps the best fitting example of this.

If you're familiar with jazz at all, it's practically required knowledge to know what this song is. Being incredibly complex, this chart does a great job at translating that feel to mania terms. With the BPM being completely variable, the timings for both hitting and releasing the notes ends up being much more of a challenge than anyone would expect. To put it into perspective, we can simply quote the description:

> how do you acc this
>
> od update idk if od 7 is too much

Of course, something of this quality wouldn't go under the radar, as [4DM24](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/2024) just recently picked it up for their Semifinals mappool. With the chart already having a following, this was quite a pleasant surprise to see.

If you think you're good at long notes, I beg you to give this a try and see if that still stands true. If it does, go vote!

[Palette GAMMA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/393179#mania/874165) has certainly been a song that's notorious for having a lot of speed charts being made for it, and this is certainly no exception. [spoonguy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/932381) offers you a very difficult rendition of the chart, with lots of factors to be taken in, such as speed, stamina, reading, and many more.

Where do I begin? Right off the bat, you're already thrown delay patterns, with a few chords being mixed in. There are also rolls which you have to accurately time, while also being able to hit them at a very fast speed. With that alone, lots of the reading and accuracy aspect have already been tested.

But once that is done, the real deal starts to show up as you get a very fast chordstream section, clocking in at 270 BPM for the base rate. Thankfully, you get a break section, wherein you'll be able to recover your hands a lot. Once that's over, you'd better start getting to work again, as your chordstream prowess will truly be tested at the second section, where you will be tasked to be able to hit the different combinations of notes consistently while being able to process them at a very fast rate.

This will certainly be a test to how competent and well rounded a player is on the 7K rice department. So, what are you waiting for? Vote yes and support the mapper if you're really looking forward to battle against the rest of the top players in the world!

One of the more classic maps by [pporse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4991434) has been chosen for this month's Loved vote!

pporse, being known for their classic and old-school-esque patterning, created this map that showcases their skill in charting consistency focused on rather basic patterns that challenge the player to get comfortable with the basics!

No gimmicks, just consistent and fun patterns from start to finish, just as we expect from this excellent mapper!

As a well known map that players have already enjoyed for a long time, we believe that this is a great pick for the Loved section. If you agree, please go ahead and vote for the map!

With well balanced, aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to play patterns, emO_Oticon displays their mastery of creating fun and challenging long note maps perfectly here.

With Yorushika being a very popular artist as well, we believe that this pick is a no-brainer for all the long note enjoyers and players who are skilled enough to challenge this map!
