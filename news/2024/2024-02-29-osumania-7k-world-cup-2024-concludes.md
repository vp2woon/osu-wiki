This has been an amazing year so far for the osu!mania 7K community. For the **first time ever** there has been a stage before Round of 16 in the 7K World Cup, and it's so good to see so many new teams apply, qualify, and compete.

## Summary

![](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_7K/img/podium.jpg)

Congratulations to South Korea on their 7th osu!mania 7K World Championship title! This is a good way to start off the year, and possibly the start of South Korea's domination in all 4 game modes, considering they easily rank top 4 in all of them.

Massive congratulations to the Philippines and Malaysia as well for putting up an amazing fight the entire way through, giving us many of the best matches this year, only possible with the huge amounts of skill both teams possess.

## Grand Finals recap

### ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea vs. ::{ flag=MY }:: Malaysia

The Grand Finals match between South Korea and Malaysia may fall into the records as one of the best exhibitions of VSRG skill ever. The ever-dominant South Korea comes into this match with a mission to regain the crown that they lost in 2023. Team Malaysia, on the other hand, hoping to end this Cinderella run of theirs the best way possible.

The Malaysians immediately took the first point on LN3, [xi - Garyou Tensei](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2137702#mania/4498825), repeating the situation during their match in the Finals. ::{ flag=MY }:: [cheewee10](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4477497)'s performance in particular with 981k score outperformed the Koreans. The statement was clear, as Malaysia would be the only team to ever take points from South Korea in the tournament.

The Koreans proved too formidable, however, as they would ramp up their onslaught with ever greater intensity. By the fourth map with their pick on RC5, [sepiarecorders - \*\*\*\*\*\*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2137690#mania/4498796) (that's the track name), they amassed a 157.8k score gap where ::{ flag=KR }:: [yz1155](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2071008) probably made a case for having the score of the tournament, achieving the only 99%-accuracy score on this chart.

Never to falter completely, the Malaysians grabbed their final point from South Korea right afterwards on LN1, [Tatsh - Reunion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1785469#mania/3657073), again with heroics coming from cheewee10 with a 969k score. South Korea then managed outstanding performances for the remaining maps, and while there was a glimpse of hope for Malaysia on RC4, [SHIKI - Orfevre](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2137727#mania/4498898), the final scoreline was sealed with extraordinary finish for the Koreans, and yz1155 in particular, on HB1, [Juggernaut. vs Gram - Seraphim](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2137710#mania/4498842).

The Koreans regained the championship of MWC7K after losing it to the Philippines last year, and have shown a level of dominance that has been expected of them since the dawn of osu!mania. Massive, massive props to Malaysia's dynamic duo as well, cheewee10 and ::{ flag=MY }:: [Neokje](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7727987), for taking Malaysia to the silver placement for the second time ever and standing tall among the best!

### ::{ flag=MY }:: Malaysia vs. ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=v2072439938&parent=osu.ppy.sh&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div>

Malaysia's last hurdle before their final showdown against South Korea was their match against the Philippines, a very strong team who has shown its fangs during the whole tournament. To say the stakes of this match were high would be an understatement.

Malaysia started strong with their emphasis on LN picks throughout the match. Starting with [xi - Garyou Tensei](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2137702#mania/4498825) and [Juggernaut. vs Gram - Seraphim](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2137710#mania/4498842), despite ::{ flag=MY }:: [cheewee10](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4477497)'s impressive scores, the Philippines managed to go 0–2 in the first two maps giving them an edge.

Even with Malaysia's performance on [wotoha - O108ROCKET (feat. Neko Hacker)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2137706#mania/4498837), they weren't able to keep up with the Philippines going all the way to 1–6. It was match point for the Philippines, but in a surprising turn of events, Malaysia's resilience kept them going! The Philippines weren't able to take that last point, and team Malaysia was able to tie 6–6 just in the nick of time.

And so, it's tiebreaker time! They'd be playing [seatrus - DiSANiMATE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2137728#mania/4498899), a relentless marathon which would take a toll on our already exhausted players. The lead was initially changing back and forth on the earlier segments. However, as the song went on, the lead was growing further favouring team Malaysia. After the final drop and onslaught, the deal was sealed and team Malaysia got the win they needed to face South Korea.

Suffice to say, this second-to-last match left everyone on the edge of their seats! It's even more impressive when we account the fact that team Malaysia was comprised of only two players — that's the minimum requirement number of users needed to participate! Congratulations to the Philippines for their podium placement likewise.

## Interviews

Who would be better placed to educate us on the thoughts and attention put into the World Cups than the players, organisers and artists themselves! Let's hear what some of them had to say about their experience this year.

::{#butanic}::

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-29-osu-mania-7k-world-cup-2024-concludes/butanic.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1433586)

Even though it's their first time participating, **butanic** is a Japanese legend and veteran when it comes to anything VSRG-related. With such accolades to their name, they've shredded through every RC pick this year, and provided an anchor for the team when they needed it the most.

[**You can find the Japanese version of the interview here.**](https://gist.github.com/0x84f/daed4ff36f81e64a5d2f68a234b1e10a)

---

*Is "butanic" a pun on "buta niku" (pork)?*

> Yes, the name came from pork.

*You started playing a long time ago. How did it start, and what makes you come back to the game and still play on such a high level for so long?*

> DJMAX Online was the first rhythm game I played, followed by o2jam and BMS. There was a time when I left BMS for a while, but I started playing BMS again when the Stella difficulty chart appeared, and I started playing osu!mania about a year ago when I found out that the osu!mania 7K Discord server in Japan had been created.
> 
> I have always been obsessed with getting first place, and even after getting first place, getting an even higher score, so I feel that my desire not to lose has helped me to maintain and improve my skills.

*Were there any aspirations or goals that you've set for yourself for the World Cup that you are able to look back upon?*

> It was my first time participating, and I was very nervous. Japan is strong in RC but very weak in LN, and we could not lose even a single RC pick, so we aimed to get a higher score than anyone else. I was especially practising to get a v1 SS in chordstreams and v2 99.99% in chordjacks.
> 
> I lost an RC pick for the first time against China, but overall I think I achieved a good result.

*Do you have anything you want to let the readers know?*

> I feel that the population of 7K users is very small compared to 4K users. I think this is simply because they are reluctant to start because of the complexity of the many fingers involved, but there are many patterns and fun things that can be expressed in 7K. The small number of users also means that there are more opportunities to participate in the MWC.
> 
> I started playing osu!mania when I was 30 years old, and I have improved a lot in the past year. As long as you have the feeling that rhythm games are fun, you have as many chances as you want to improve! If you are still playing only 4K, please try to play 7K as well, and let's fight in the MWC someday!

::{#yz1155}::

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-29-osu-mania-7k-world-cup-2024-concludes/yz1155.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2071008)

Born and raised in osu!mania, **yz1155** has climbed through the ranks and is now standing shoulder to shoulder next to some of the greatest osu!mania players ever on the osu!mania 7K World Cup stage. They have outdone themselves this year by being a core player for the South Korean team, with emphasis on their amazing performance on technical charts.

---

*You started playing a long time ago. How did it start, and what makes you come back to the game and still play on such a high level for so long?*

> I forgot what made me start VSRGs, but I remember why I stopped playing the game. It was because I didn't have enough time.
> 
> At first, I didn't play for 1 day, after that I didn't play for a week and then, for a month… It just happened until it had been a couple of years. But, I started playing VSRGs again after I got enough spare time. Why did I restart? Because playing games is fun! It is a simple, but important reason.
> 
> I played VSRG for so long, but I am not at such a high level of skill at all. So, I can't answer how I could play at such a high level for so long, however, I can give an answer of how I played for long! To put it simply, it was because I always enjoyed playing.
> 
> Why are we all playing games? Definitely, for enjoyment. If you don't have an interest in Ranked maps or on regular Dan stages, you don't have to play it. Just enjoying is what I want to do and that is the main reason why I keep playing after such a long time.

*Were there any aspirations or goals that you've set for yourself for the World Cup that you are able to look back upon?*

> Tournaments like MWC7K, SOL, and ETT are like fan signing events with huge star players for me. I don't mind the result of the tournament, because I always enjoy everything. As a VSRG fan, meeting superstars in tournaments is already a huge level of enjoyment. So, my goal is to always have some fun and do my best.

*Do you have anything you want to let the readers know?*

> [dressurf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/758406), [cheewee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4477497) and [Kura](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11420405) are not earthlings. It's a huge secret, so don't let anyone know.

::{#-noname-}::

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-29-osu-mania-7k-world-cup-2024-concludes/noname.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10400730)

**-NoName-** has gone absolutely bonkers this year, not only answering the call of being a mappool selector, but also going above and beyond by contributing to **12** of the picks throughout this year's tournament. Some say they placed 50,000 notes over the course of this year's tournament alone, but we'll leave actually counting them to someone else.

---

*What were your initial thoughts about stepping up as the head pooler for this World Cup? What made you go for it?*

> Did you know that originally, this was going to be a Round of 16 tournament? That was my original plan because I assumed that we would follow last year's format, but then [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576) (4K MWC's head pooler) told me that it should be a Round of 24 since Qualifier results from 2023 showed that seeds 19–24 were somewhat competitive. That was the "Oh shoot, I'm actually in charge of this now" moment for me.

*What were your favourite charts in the pool, if there are any? Are there any favourites among the ones you worked on?*

> The most obvious one is [Evening](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2193881)'s chart of [rosso](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2134144), the tiebreaker for the Finals round. He spent four months working on it. It is hardly recognizable now compared to what it was a few months ago. The reception to it was equally crazy as well, and it also produced [one of the best endings to a match](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2066497602?t=1h5m19s) I've ever seen.
> 
> I thought [zeno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6576888)'s [Hi Genjitsu Tohi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1885701#mania/4490678) (Finals LN2) was neat as well. It is a lot closer to traditional *O2Jam* patterns than people have previously seen in the tournament. The people asked for shields after 2023, and that is what they got.
> 
> [_Yiiiii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6066359)'s Round of 24 tiebreaker, [Majestic 12](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119554#mania/4452392), was cool as well. I think it was very well-balanced, and the chart is just fun to play. It also introduced me to this banger of a song, so thanks for that! It was interesting seeing people's reactions to various players missing on the seemingly easy breaks in the match, though. A lot of people who don't play 7K osu!mania thought people were missing on easy parts for no reason. If only they knew…

*Any messages you want to impart to the team? Or to anyone who wants to become part of any tournament's map selection team?*

> To the team: none of this would have been possible without you. This was definitely a learning experience for us, and we will be making many adjustments for future iterations.
> 
> For anyone who wants to become a part of the team, we look forward to seeing your application sometime in August or September. We especially need help from those who make LN charts, so feel free to apply at that point, and we'll see how we can fit you in if possible. I remember signing up for play testing in 2023, and it was the most fun playing this game I've ever had.

::{#akiri}::

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-29-osu-mania-7k-world-cup-2024-concludes/akiri.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19587411)

**Akiri** is first and foremost one of our own, a community member and osu!mania player. They had their World Cup debut with this year's Semifinals tiebreaker, but their music journey goes [so far beyond that](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/401).

---

*How did you get into music production?*

> It was out of spite, my father told me I'd never be capable of creating a name for myself which resulted in me simply doing so to spite him.

*What was your main inspiration for "Symphony of the Lost Souls"?*

> My inspiration was from my story I'm writing, following our main character as he is currently trapped in a soul star.

*Were there any considerations that you had to keep in mind while working on MWC7K?*

> Not particularly, other than keeping stuff clean and professional I had a great time while working on everything.

*Aside from the people in the osu!mania scene you have featured on your tracks, do you have any other people you want to collaborate with?*

> I do! I'd love to work with games like *Arcaea* and *Beat Saber* as well as collab with artists like Creo and Meganeko (two large inspirations in my early career).

Thank you to all **71** contributors who helped make this year's osu!mania World Cup 7K tournament what it is, and thank you to **130** tournament participants who came out to show off their skills and have fun!

This year has shown that the interest in 7K mania is slowly growing, and we hope that trend continues. Hopefully this year brings new stars into the scene, ready to fight their way to the top, each with their own rivalries, strengths and weaknesses.

Who knows — maybe even you, the reader, might be the next 7K rising star?
