Sprouting from a circle clicker into a full-fledged musician, **watering** has joined our Featured Artists!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/416/header.png)

Inspired by the likes of *dev*, *Shoebill*, *Waqs*, and a swathe of music here on osu!, **watering** (a.k.a. [water](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11671515)) mastered the craft of shaping sounds into complex and engaging breakcore rhythms which, not-so-coincidentally, make for awesome beatmaps.

**8** tracks have ~~*broken* into the *core* of~~ found their way to [**watering**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/416).

**watering** initially found a home in the osu!taiko community, where crazy breakcore drum patterns could be fully appreciated with Kats and Dons. See how that turned out below:

Those are only a few of the tracks available on [**watering**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/416). If you want more, you'll have to do some legwork. And by legwork, we mean clicking a link.

Another artist is scheduled for exactly one week from today (and every Saturday thereafter, until the end of time).

Stay tuned.
