Pull the curtains back to reveal the latest addition to our Featured Artist library!

UK-based artist **Draper** eloquently describes his creative process as "I make music on my kompyuta." Now it's your turn to click circles to **Draper**'s tunes on your own kompyuta.

Not every Featured Artist addition includes a huge batch of songs per artist, but don't worry — even if [**Draper**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/403) has only 2 songs, they're both exactly what you'd be looking for.

Check everything out:

You've read this far, which means you're obligated to visit [**Draper**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/403) and download one of the pre-timed beatmap templates. From there, you'll have to figure out how the editor works. Best of luck.

A lot of our Featured Artist releases lately have been focused on electronic music, so next week we'll be switching things up.

Stay tuned.
