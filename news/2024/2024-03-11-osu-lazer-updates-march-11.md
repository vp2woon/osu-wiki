### Smaller changes

- **osu! file associations work now.** You can double click beatmaps, skins, etc. to open them in osu!(lazer).
- **Beatmap difficulty information when hovering a beatmap in a multiplayer or playlist lobby.** Another feature from osu!(stable) that was missing until now.
- **The F grade is updated to match website designs.** You can now fail in a more fabulous fashion.
- **Fixed main menu eating keys if user presses too fast.** osu! can now keep up with your TAS-level menuing skills.
- **User statistics updates now show on multiplayer and playlist results screen.** Did you know you can earn pp and gain ranks even in multiplayer? It turns out the client didn't, but now it does.
- **Various stable parity tweaks.** Varying from visual to gameplay changes, the devs put in some extra work to make sure lazer matches stable to (mostly) pixel- and frame-perfect precision.
- **Various performance improvements, especially for intense storyboards.** These have been spearheaded by [EVAST](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8195163), and there are more improvements in the pipeline already!
- **New main menu navigation hotkeys.** Similar to stable, you will now be able to use hotkeys to quickly get to your desired destination. For example:
  - `P` (x3) for song select (you could already do this)
  - `E` (x3) for the beatmap editor
  - `E` (x2) + `S` for the skin editor
  - `M` (x3) for multiplayer
  - `L` (x3) for playlists
  - `S` (x2) for settings
- **The "argon" skin now includes a performance point counter by default.** This mirrors the "triangles" skin.

### Achieved medals are now displayed in osu!(lazer)

Medals when? Right now! All medals (except Hush-Hush ones) are now achievable on lazer, complete with all the familiar fanfare.
