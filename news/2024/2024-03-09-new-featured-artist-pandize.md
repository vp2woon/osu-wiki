Another week, another Featured Artist. Welcome **Pandize** to our collection!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/405/header.jpg?1)

Not to be confused with [Panda Eyes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/55), **Pandize** is an American producer who you might've come across for reasons beyond their music. Like all of you (probably), [Pandize is an osu! player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5490937) who's taken the next step in the rhythm game scene: producing their own music!

[Pegboard Nerds](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/287), [Teminite](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/64), and [Tokyo Machine](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/276) were just a few of the names responsible for inspiring **Pandize**'s composition style — a style that's been under construction since he started making music in 2012.

Enough stalling. We've snagged **6** stellar tracks, which you can unsurprisingly find on [**Pandize**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/405)!

Listen for yourself:

If you're wondering what to do with all of this info, there's only one option: [download one of the pre-timed beatmap templates](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/405) and start mapping. If you try anything else, you'll obviously be missing out.

Stay tuned for next week's artist. We'll see you then.
