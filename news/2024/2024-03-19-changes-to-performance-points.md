Today peppy has graciously given (almost) everyone more performance points. Read on to find out why!

As part of turning on performance points for osu!(lazer), there was a change in how much **bonus pp** would be awarded. In a [video by peppy and pishifat last month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7SZk8mU7Ww&t=40s), this change was mentioned to have been applied for the lazer client, and that it would be applied to stable at a later date. **Today is that day.**

Apart from the [weighted sum of your top performances](/wiki/Performance_points#weightage-system), your total pp value also includes a bonus portion depending on how much you've played (in order to give new players a sense of progression). This bonus portion is 417 pp at its maximum and *used to be* achieved when you hit around 13,000 completed beatmap difficulties. That was changed to be around 1,000 difficulties.

Here's a graph if you're a visual person (and here's the [interactive variant](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ll2foxmgp3)):

In short, you will find yourself having more bonus pp unless you're one of the select few that have played 10,000+ beatmaps.

Also, since both osu!(lazer) and osu!(stable) are now using the same performance point processor, scores set on osu!(lazer) will always be included in your pp value — even when playing on osu!(stable).

Your rank graph will also no longer flip-flop when you switch between clients. This means if your graph [looked](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/30070868) [something](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079) [like](https://twitter.com/stompymymood/status/1769833222450405756) [this](https://twitter.com/Vid_osu/status/1770132123141251427)...

...it will resume its stable growth (or decay) once again.

Those were the details, but for the brass tacks: **most people won't see any rank change, even though you may gain pp.**
