Let your talents bloom in the Spring 2024 Fanart Contest!

Yep, it's that time of the year again, where you get to showcase your artistic prowess in a glorious clash against others who've mastered the ability of maneuvering the coveted combo of the stylus and the tablet (or a mouse if you're daring enough).

As per usual, we have a teeny tiny catch in the shape of a theme for this iteration:

**Draw any of the osu! mascots (or community mascots) mesmerised by vivid colours in a spring flower garden!**

That's right, this is where florists and colour aficionados will shine! Flowers come in all shapes and sizes and many have interesting variants of alternate colours (perhaps that you didn't know about!). As long as your piece features an osu! mascot enjoying flowers in a garden during spring, there's nothing stopping you.

In case you want to start drawing RIGHT NOW but are so intimidated by all the possibilities that your head draws blanks, don't worry! Here are some suggestions to take inspiration from:

- The osu! cast touring around a majestic greenhouse filled with exotic flowers of all rainbow colours
- Chirou getting absolutely buried in one of the pristine flower beds of a mansion garden
- pippi showing Mocha her enthusiastically handcrafted backyard set of assorted lavender croci, roseate azaleas or perhaps apricot tulips
- Alisa relaxing by a pond of quiescent water lilies
- ...or basically anything you can think of that involves the art of floral composition in some sort of garden!

As always, a selection of the top-voted finalists will make it to the main menu and receive 3 months of osu!supporter, plus the top 3 will also receive fancy bespoke profile badges made from their own creations.

## Rules

- **By submitting your artwork to this contest, you grant us permission to use your artwork in the main menu client should it win, and to use it in promotional material for both the game (osu!) and the contest (Spring 2024 Fanart Contest).** You retain all rights to your creation and you can sell it and distribute it however you like — it is your work, after all. We're just saying here that if you submit your piece to this contest, you should be okay with us using it.
- **All entries MUST follow the contest theme (spring flower gardens) and contain AT LEAST one of the osu! official or community mascots.** The wrath of the Dean "peppy" Herbert may not be so merciful if you choose otherwise...
- **All entries MUST be suitable for all-ages viewing.** We're here to admire nature's beauty, not to tarnish it!
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK. REDRAWING AND COMPOSITE WORKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** Plagiarism sucks. Don't do it. Someone in the comments will call you out for it as has happened every other time someone's tried and they're going to do more damage to your reputation than us removing your entry from the voting will do. Use only your own work — brushes and the like are fine, but that's it! Don't redraw or trace someone else's work.
- **Generative art programs or methods (such as AI) are not allowed.** This includes any kind of software that has you supply a written or visual prompt and fills in large amounts of details for you. We will know if you do this. If we somehow miss it, the community won't. Don't sully your legacy as an artist!
- **Entrants must keep a full file containing all of their entry's layers available.** We'll only ask you for this if we think it's needed to ascertain any claims regarding plagiarism or the use of generative art tools. If you don't/can't provide us this within a timely manner when we ask, we'll have no choice but to pull your listing from the contest, sorry!
- **Artist attribution (names, social media handles, etc.) must be limited to no more than three lines total and confined to any corner of your entry.** Being proud of your work is good, just do it in a reasonably small spot of your work. One thing unique to osu!'s history is that we really don't like forced advertisement, and attribution that is too large can come across like it.
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece — namely 2732x1536. THIS IS CHECKED BY A SCRIPT AND ENTRIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE DISCARDED AUTOMATICALLY.** This remains the \#1 reason for distressed emails sent after the contest about why an entry didn't make it in. Even ONE pixel off is enough. Export your creations at the correct resolution!
- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed on the main menu and during the voting process.** The circular spot in the middle shows where the main-menu cookie will be when inside the game. Factor this in when designing your piece, as anything inside it is likely not going to be seen. This doesn't mean leaving a big circular hole full of nothing in the middle! Be creative. *Make sure you don't leave it visible in your end result.*
- **Do not leave the dotted osu! cookie template visible in your submission.** Let's keep the streak going as strong as ever.
- **If you're using characters from other intellectual properties, do so sparingly.** All the official osu! mascots and the community mascots are fair game, but please avoid using excessive representations of characters from other worlds or franchises in your work — the contest is about osu! foremost, after all. Remember also that the community mascots are someone else's treasured creation, so please treat them with the same respect that you'd treat your own OCs and work.

Okay, got all that? Good job. Your next mission is to head over to the [Spring 2024 Fanart Contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/205) once you've finished cooking your masterpiece and drop it there. You may reupload your entry to your heart's desire if you want to make any adjustments, but you only have **20 days** to do so before the doors close off forever, so don't brood over which pixels to slightly recolour for too long!

Until then, good luck!
