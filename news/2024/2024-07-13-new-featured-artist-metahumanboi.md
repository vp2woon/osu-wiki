If you think 200 BPM streams are fast, you haven't considered what **MetaHumanBoi** has to offer.

A modern master of speedcore (and the countless other J-EDM subgenres that treat 220 BPM as normal), **MetaHumanBoi** knows exactly what makes an intense rhythm game song. Of course, knowledge like that comes best with experience — **MetaHumanBoi** spends a bunch of their time in games like *A Dance of Fire and Ice* and, of course, [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14782369).

**8** awesome songs are part of [**MetaHumanBoi**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/430), and soon as you try mapping, they'll be part of your beatmap library too.

260 BPM? 8.5 stars? Not an issue for [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961):
