Mappers and musicians, gather up! Express your creativity to the maximum with mapping and music, right here on osu!.

Brought to you by [bokeru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11308433), [chidodou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13868581), [Supportive](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/21482068) and [Whithard](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24552396), this contest revolves around the idea of expression, versatility, and best of all, **expression**! Keep reading to see how you can join in on the fun by participating!

With the first iteration, being most inspired from [THE BMS OF FIGHTERS](https://www.bmsoffighters.net/) (surely something you've heard about before), Kyoku is a contest that will focus on not only beatmapping, but song production as well.

Instead of free song choice, or the usual forced song pick, you'll have to get together with at least one musician (or even be a producer yourself!) in teams of 2–8 (up to 5 mappers and up to 3 musicians) to create a fresh new song AND map!

## Schedule

| Event | Dates |
| --: | :-- |
| Registrations | April 6 to June 9 |
| Song production & mapping period | June 10 to August 22 |
| Judging | August 23 to August 31 |
| Results | September 1 |

## Rules

### Registration

- **Register through [this form](https://forms.gle/GrQUNjZ8BeVWxEZ39).**
- **Teams cannot be smaller than 2 or larger than 8.** Mappers are allowed to be producers too!
- **Teams may have up to 5 mappers and up to 3 music producers.**
- **At least one team member must join the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/XPUPjFamuU).**

### Music

Starting June 10th, 2024, musicians will be allowed to send their song to any of the organisers to check over for approval to the organisers on the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/XPUPjFamuU) (listed in the beginning of this post), under these rules:

- **Songs must be original works created for the contest**, or at the very least, previously unreleased. Anything found to be breaking this rule will be immediately disqualified.
- **Songs must stay unreleased until the day of results.**
- **Songs must be 2:00–6:00 in length.**
- **Obvious bait/troll submissions will be immediately disqualified.**
- **Songs CAN be adjusted after approval.** Avoid editing things that would affect things like rhythm choice or adding entirely new sections.
- **No commissions allowed.** This is to prevent creating an environment where people can outprice others.

### Mapping

As soon as your team's song is approved, you are allowed to start mapping!

- **All submissions must include a single difficulty.**
- **Drain time in the song should be split between all mappers participating as evenly as possible.**
- **Submissions must be in the osu! mode only.**
- **Maps must not be submitted through the [Beatmap Submission System](/wiki/Beatmapping/Beatmap_submission) or be publicised until the day of results.**
- **All maps must follow the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).**
- **Storyboards/videos are not permitted for the submission.** This is to prevent bias formed by the presentation of the map.

## Submission

Submission of the *final beatmap* will be handled through the [contest page](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/211), and will be anonymised upon submission, including artist names.

Only one team member needs to submit, and you can reupload your submission as many times as you want until the deadline of August 22!
