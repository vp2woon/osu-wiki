The NAT Gazette returns with a big bang and a bigger list of changes to cover!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-06-10-the-nat-gazette-june-2024/nat-gazette-june-2024.jpg)

The NAT isn't dead, nor is the long awaited batch of updates that have slowly been creeping in ever since the last issue. With a bigger emphasis placed on transparency and easing communication between the Beatmap Nominators and the general playerbase, we'd like to shift gears and focus on how users receive this full suite of updates.

While there's a lot to go through, our resident bird connoisseur [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) has prepared us a changelog in the form of a video! We encourage giving it a look to quickly be up to speed with all the changes to come.

</div>

These changes come after an extensive community discussion was held in the [BN Management subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/115). Moving on, big changes like these will be posted there as to foster a healthy discussion with everyone in the community. As the changes to come will come out in cycles, it is very important to get your feedback â€” your voice matters!

## Updates

This time around we bring quite a sackful of changes. From additions in the ranking criteria, to sweeping changes in the way both new applicants and current BNs will be evaluated, there's a little of something for everyone.

### Evaluations moving forward

Based on recent community feedback, the osu! Nomination Assessment Team will no longer take a proactive approach enforcing arbitrary mapping quality standards in their evaluations. We believe the community as a whole must be the one to decide what's best for the platform.

This change in perspective means that osu! Beatmap Nominators **will not** be punished for any subjective concern that the evaluators may have had on beatmaps that have been ranked without resets. Unrankables, unranks, and any other objective issue will still be handled as per usual.

While we may experiment with more changes depending on how things turn out, the direction of letting the community set their own standards will not change.

Do note that this change only affects the osu! game mode, and other game modes will still handle evaluations as they've been doing so far.

### Community-wide changes

#### Beatmap Management subforum

As briefly spoiled before, we have created the brand-new [*BN Management* subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/115). This subforum aims to be a place for any Beatmap Nominator to start a discussion regarding the user group, Ranked section, or any of the systems involved with it. This not only aims to empower BNs by giving them an outlet to express their ideas, but also for the playerbase to interact and discuss in any open post and provide feedback to the proposals.

#### Public evaluations archive

A public repository with both applications and current BN evaluations can now be accessed by anyone! The repository can be found in the [BN website](https://bn.mappersguild.com/publicarchive). The goal of this change was for applicants to have a point of reference and learn from existing applications to know what to expect! Currently, only users who opt in will have their evaluations shown in the repository.

#### Ranking criteria changes

| Type | Change | Link |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **General** | Songs and artists currently disallowed in the [Content usage permissions](/wiki/Rules/Content_usage_permissions#artist-permissions) article will **not** be able to be ranked without explicit approval from their respective owners. | [View changes](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/pull/11262) |
| **General** | Clarification on what counts as either an extended edit or cut version in the case a recreation of the original audio is made. | [View changes](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/pull/11122) |

### Beatmap Nominator applications

The new changes aim to simplify and lower the bar of entry, while trimming any unnecessary processes that have accumulated since the inception of the application system. For those who were daunted or lost before, we encourage [applying today](https://bn.mappersguild.com/bnapps) to experience the changes yourselves!

#### A fresh application workflow

The application process has been streamlined, easing users into the application process by giving more specific pointers on what mods and explanations they're expected to give at the time of applying. The goal of this change was to "handhold" new applicants through the application process and for the NAT to focus more on the decision-making of candidates rather than solely base their verdict from mods alone.

#### Removal of the ranking criteria test

Yep, you heard it here first. Or probably not. But the RC test is gone, dusted. Vanished, not to come again in the foreseeable future. The test in its current form didn't offer a lot. Besides being a filter and an English comprehension test, it was redundant as applicants would better show their understanding of the ranking criteria through their mods.

#### Streamlining cooldowns

Cooldowns have been unified across the board. Failed applicants and BNs who get kicked for low activity will always have to wait 60 days before reapplying again under normal circumstances. This does not apply to Beatmap Nominators who leave on good terms and want to rejoin within a year after their departure, in which case they will be able to rejoin instantly.

#### Progress bar for applications

One of the issues with the opaqueness of the process was that candidates didn't know when their verdict would be delivered, or at what stage their application was. By offering our very own BN app parcel tracking service, applicants will now be able to be updated in real time when their ~~food~~ application will be delivered.

#### Reworking application feedback

Feedback has been simplified. In short, this change will make the feedback writing process which was deemed redundant be less time-consuming. This will quicken the time for the results of an application to be delivered. The evaluators' comments will instead serve as more in-depth feedback.

#### A chat for asking questions about evaluations

After receiving their verdict, users can reply to their evaluators' feedback in the BN site. While the goal of this change is not to facilitate appeals as under normal circumstances the result of an application is unchangeable, applicants are encouraged to ask questions and clarification on their feedback by using this new feature.

### Within the Beatmap Nominators

#### Probation is no longer a demotion option

The Probationary Beatmap Nominators user group has been reworked slightly. It will now serve its original goal, which is as a trial ground for greenhorns! When a new Beatmap Nominator is allowed into the team, they will be put in probation for their first couple months. After evaluating their performance with actual BN work, they will either be promoted or removed. Full Beatmap Nominators cannot under any circumstance be demoted back into probation.

#### Mock evaluations are no more

Beatmap Nominators will not be able to make mock evaluations anymore. Besides being underused, the system was usually superseded by the introduction of BN Evaluator cycles.

#### Vetoes

Vetoes have been slightly reworked. Once a veto is made, the entire user group of the game mode which it concerns will be drafted instead of a random jury. While participation is not obligatory, this change aims to provide a better representation of what the BN group of a game mode thinks of a veto, in turn making the results feel less like RNG.

#### Hybrid beatmapset nomination changes

Beatmaps comprised of two or more game modes should have an easier time getting ranked! While the old system required two proficient BNs for each game mode present in a beatmap, with the new changes only the main game mode of a set will need two BNs. The other game modes will only require one nomination each.

The main game mode of a beatmap is the one with the most difficulties, or the one with the most difficulties mapped by the host in the case of a tie. If it's still a tie between multiple modes, any one of them may be considered the main one and will need two nominations, giving the mapper and BNs some extra flexibility.

#### Opt-in subjective feedback in evaluations

Beatmap Nominators are now able to opt-in to receive extra feedback in their evaluations. While this won't change the outcome of their evaluation whatsoever, this will let evaluators go a bit more in-depth in their feedback and, in turn, let the Beatmap Nominator learn from their comments. By default BNs will only receive more objective feedback on actual mistakes made.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-06-10-the-nat-gazette-june-2024/evaluation-feedback.jpg)

It's important to note that this feature has only been put into place in the osu! game mode, and other game modes will still deliver feedback as they've been doing so far.

### Within the Nomination Assessment Team

#### NAT additions

With the removal of mock evaluations, the NAT addition process will fully rely on BN Evaluator cycles. Beatmap Nominators can sign up for these cycles, and their peers will vouch for the people they'd like to see assigned. The NAT will pick from this curated list, taking into consideration the opinions of the BNs who vouched for their peers.

It's worth noting that the current implementation is prone to change depending on community feedback. The plan is to test this new implementation to see what works and what doesn't, so stay tuned for more changes to come!

## Things to look out for

### Ranking criteria clean-up project

The [Ranking Criteria clean-up project](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1836226) is still going strong! A few proposals already made it into the RC, with more looming around the corner such as the [metadata](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1894663?n=1) or the [storyboard](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1897427?n=1) proposals currently being discussed.

### Badges

A whole lot of badges related to Beatmap Nominators and the Nomination Assessment Team have received a fresh coat of paint over the past few months thanks to [Tanza3D](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10379965). They are a little something to indicate the sheer amount of time committed for the mapping ecosystem.

We've laid them out below along with each recipient so far:

That is all for today! To stay tuned with discussions to come, we encourage everyone to keep an eye in the [Beatmap Management subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/115). Getting to know the community's opinion is crucial, and giving power to the user base should be our priority moving forward.
