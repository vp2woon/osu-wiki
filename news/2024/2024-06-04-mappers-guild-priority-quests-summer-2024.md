The only thing better than clicking circles is *creating* circles to click. Through the **Mappers' Guild**, you can put your mapping mastery to the test with a new batch of quests!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/mappersguild.png)

For anyone confused by proper nouns, the [**Mappers' Guild**](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild) is an MMO-inspired mapping system surrounding osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists). Mappers can [earn rewards](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#rewards) for completing mapping-related tasks, like ranking maps, participating in contests, and collaborating on [quests](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#quests) (which is what this article is about!).

The Mappers' Guild is open to mappers of any skill level, including those without Ranked maps! See [the system's website](https://mappersguild.com/) or the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy)'s `#mappers-guild` channel for details!

## What are priority quests?

[Last year](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild), the Mappers' Guild introduced a new way to get involved: [**priority quests**](https://mappersguild.com/missions). These are an alternative to [ordinary Mappers' Guild quests](https://mappersguild.com/quests) with a few key differences:

- **Anyone can participate in priority quests.** Unlike normal quests, you don't need to claim priority quests in advance.
- **Quests are tiered by difficulty:**
  - Tier 1 ![bronze icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/bronze-small.png) (easiest, most common, and lowest reward)
  - Tier 2 ![silver icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/silver-small.png)
  - Tier 3 ![gold icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/gold-small.png)
  - Tier 4 ![platinum icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/platinum-small.png) (hardest, least common, and highest reward)
- **Multiple users can complete the same quest**. Most of the time, anyone who accomplishes the quest's objective before the deadline is eligible.

By completing priority quests, you can earn some special rewards too:

- All the usual [Mappers' Guild rewards](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#rewards) for ranking beatmaps
- A [**customised keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) based on a pattern in your map
- A profile badge upon completing 3 priority quests

## New priority quests

**6** new quests have just been added to the [priority quest listing](https://mappersguild.com/missions), all of which will be open to mappers until **September 14, 2024**!

Below is an overview of each quest. If any are confusing, feel free to ask questions in the comments!

### ["new" beginnings](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=665bbbddff4c38cea1113302) ![bronze icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/bronze-small.png)

Tons of mappers have Ranked maps, but a few have *never* touched Featured Artist songs.

It's time to undergo the Mappers' Guild initiation: rank your **first Featured Artist map** using any song from [osu!'s music library](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists)!

If you already have a Ranked map using a Featured Artist song (excluding GDs), this quest isn't for you. Try scrolling down.

### [Back to basics](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=665bbbf9ff4c38cea1113316) ![bronze icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/bronze-small.png)

If you're too good at the game, is it hard to recognise what players find fun? It's time to find out.

This quest is limited to anyone with at least **10,000 pp** in a game mode. Your goal is to rank a map with...

- ...at minimum, a spread of Easy/Normal/Hard/Insane difficulties
- ...no difficulties above 5.0 stars

### [osu! original expansion](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=665bbc24ff4c38cea1113321) ![bronze icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/bronze-small.png)

A lot of the [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals) in osu!'s music library come from the World Cups. Many of those songs don't reach players beyond their initial mode, so let's change that.

Your goal is to rank a map of any **World Cup osu! original** in a game mode that...

- **...it was NOT created for.** For example, [Sanctuary](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1889094) was created for the osu! World Cup, so it's valid for osu!taiko/osu!catch/osu!mania.
- **...does not have a Ranked map for the song as of June 3, 2024**. For example, [OOParts](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1312143) was created for the osu! World Cup, but also has [Ranked osu!taiko and osu!mania maps](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=ooparts), so it'd only be valid for osu!catch.

Use [this page](/wiki/osu!_originals#official-tournament-releases) to see which mode each song was created for!

### [Monthly Beatmapping Contest returns v2](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=665bbc41ff4c38cea1113325) ![silver icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/silver-small.png)

Rank a map from any of your [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) submissions. If you've never made a map for the Monthly Beatmapping Contest, that may change soon. :)

### [Multi-mode enthusiasts](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=665bbcc1ff4c38cea1113337) ![gold icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/gold-small.png)

osu! has experienced a drought of multi-mode beatmaps for the last few years.
After [this recent change to nomination logic](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/10984), multi-mode beatmaps can be Ranked with fewer nominations, so it's time to take action!

Work together with **one** other mapper to rank a map with 2 game modes (in this case, different osu!mania key counts do not count as separate modes). Each of the two mappers will earns priority quest prizes.

### [Classified v2](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=665bbcd8ff4c38cea1113342) ![platinum icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/platinum-small.png)

This quest goes back to the roots of the Mappers' Guild: **making maps for upcoming Featured Artists**.

Your goal is to create and rank a map for it to be showcased in the artist's upcoming announcement! To participate in this quest, the first step is to select a song from the [quest page](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=665bbcd8ff4c38cea1113342).

This quest requires some confidentiality, so it's only available to those who have a history of contributions to the Mappers' Guild. More specifically, this includes anyone who's rank 1 or higher in the guild.

## Other changes to the Mappers' Guild

The **Mappers' Guild** is an ever-changing system. In addition to this batch of quests and a billion bug fixes, there's one recent change that's worth showcasing:

**Tier progress is shown on your user profile!**

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-06-04-mappers-guild-priority-quests-summer-2024/progress.jpg)

While it's mainly designed to show progress towards the next milestone, this display also breaks down each category of points earned, highlighting how everyone contributes to the Mappers' Guild in their own ways.

And it has pretty colors.

If you made it this far, it's about time you head to [checking out the new priority quests](https://mappersguild.com/missions).

Have fun mapping!
