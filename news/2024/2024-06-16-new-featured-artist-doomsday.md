osu! has been around for nearly two decades. In that time, countless community members have come and gone, but one name has been here since the very beginning: **Doomsday**, our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/425/header.jpg)

This UK-based top player, mapper, commentator, and now musician joins our Featured Artists with his own brand of aural awesomeness inspired by rhythm game songs, UK hardcore, video game soundtracks, and whatever other styles catch his ~~eye~~ ear.

If [**Doomsday**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/425) and its **7** tracks aren't already on your mapping to-do list, you may need to shift some priorities.

**Doomsday**'s forte is high-level circle clicking, so it's no surprise that his music has found its way into premier tournaments like *Battle of the Box* and *The Perennial* with [Luyten's Star](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2134395) and [TGGT](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198890), the latter of which debuted literally today! See how that went below:
