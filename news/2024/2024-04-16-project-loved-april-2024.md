Ah, the smell of fresh Project Loved picks...

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

It's the spring of 2024, and you are walking through an old-growth forest, pondering over what Project Loved is. As a gentle breeze blows right by you, you make out a faint voice that says: "Project Loved is a community poll where the community gets to decide which maps get to be a part of the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). The maps are nominated by [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes, and you can view each map's poll by clicking on the respective banner, or view all of them on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The polls last for 10 days, so don't forget to vote, and feel free to visit the Project Loved [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh) for more details."

You think to yourself how that's a really specific topic, but still get curious about the previous month's results. No worries though, we have you covered.

142 – 220 BPM, 2:24 | 4.55★ – 6.49★\
*description written by [vyper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9948665)*

For this month's Popular Playcounts pick, we are bringing in a legendary stream benchmark mapset, [Various Artists - Stream Practice Maps](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/43701#osu/137122) hosted by [NewRulerNA](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/605540), for players to test their stream ability.

If you've been around for long enough, you'll surely understand how old stream legends were made with this beatmap. With 4,600,000+ plays and 800+ favorites, there is no doubt that it has been a community favorite for more than 10 years. The map's title is pretty much self-explanatory; it is truly a stream benchmark test with each difficulty mostly being riddled with deathstreams and bursts with little to no time to rest. This map features a variety of difficulties with 8 songs in 1 set, ranging from *Rondo Alla Turca (Ryu\* Remix)* at 4.55★ and 142 BPM, to *rog-limitation* at 6.49★ and 220 BPM.

Give this map a vote, and if it's Loved, you'll get to see how well your streaming skills compare to everyone else in the world!

For this month's Outstanding Oldies, we've got what could definitely be called a Meme Monstrosity. [GladiOol](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23326), Remco32, and Lesjuh bring us what could only be described as one of the most genuine 2009 beatmaps out there, and it's no wonder it's a staple pick for many old map tournaments out there. Of course, as with any 2009 beatmap, you'll probably want to check your low-AR reading and wide angle jump skills before attempting this one. But, at the very least, this time we've got a full mapset for any skill level to enjoy! It should be a piece of cake.

*description written by [Skill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7802027)*

The Daredevil Difficulty for April is [-NeBu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4099626)'s map of [Linkin Park - A Line In The Sand](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1772110#osu/3628152).

-NeBu- Aim + Linkin Park? Sounds like an amazing time... if you're into both things anyway.

This **8.39★**, 6:25 map starts off rather slow with filler in the intro that lasts for over a minute. When the map finally ramps up around \~1:13, we get to the part where the real challenge begins. It immediately introduces what the map has to offer and only merely a taste of what's coming at the end. I won't ruin the surprise for you, so go ahead and give it a try if you like aim, as it's truly one of my personal favorite aim maps.

Want to see this enter Loved? It's up to you, so leave us your vote!

The humble beginnings of one of the greatest mappers in the modern osu! era, and it sure is a banger.

This full set ranges from 2.33★ to 6.31★, boasting a mix of tech and reading. [Luscent](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2688581) and [fanzhen0019](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/418699)'s diffs provide an enjoyable experience for the former, and [YokesPai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6399568) and [Aery](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3994671)'s diffs ramp the density up for the latter. All this on top of an absolute bop, with Kuroa\*'s stunning vocals. Vote this classic in for Loved today!

⚠ WARNING! ⚠ LOVE B.B.B DETECTED IN 2024

That's right, our beloved players [Saika0k1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4316633) and [YokesPai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6399568) have put their own twist on [LOVE B.B.B's](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1100957#osu/2436870) electrifying built-in keysounds and beautiful melody. Although appearing as a simple reading challenge on the surface, constant rhythmic elements and heavy aim control make this possibly one of the most satisfying gimmick maps in the game. Also, I wasn't joking about the keysounds — the [backing track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ2SreVR7eQ) sounds like it came straight from some *Final Destination* visualization.

So, does anyone actually know what the B.B.B part stands for? [Banger Bonanza Brawl](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1541618?n=1)?

[Pluto Relinquish](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/128351#osu) is the much harder sequel to the popular map *Black Hole - Pluto*, which was ranked by [Snow Note](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/643394) back in 2012. This 7.5-star behemoth will put all your skills to the test with crazy jumps, spaced triples, and even some streams!

Snow Note is famous for his very hard "old-style" maps, and this is no exception. If you want to see yet another Snow Note map added to the Loved catalog, don't forget to vote yes!

This drum and bass remix of *Halo 4*'s classic [Green & Blue](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/63732#osu) evokes a deep, poignant feeling, reminding me of nostalgia for a map I had never played back then. I can imagine the cicadas chirping outside my window as I played every low–star rating map imaginable, all with a massive smile plastered on my face. When a map evokes those feelings, you know it's special.

[galvenize](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/381444) might not be as well known today, but the many great maps they created will not be forgotten anytime soon. I hope this to be one of them, memorialized in the Loved category, so make sure to vote today!

Here's our Wildcard #1 for the month. And I know, I know... Another [rustbell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/227717) map? Well, I know what you're thinking, *"You better have a good reason to pick this over other maps!"*, and yes, my reason is... Look at the submission date for this. Then look at the beatmap. Then look at the submission date again. Then, there you go. Actually, look at the map again. And maybe once more to the submission date.

This beatmap is what can only be described as a "time traveler" map. Here, rustbell already shows a developed style with a strong sense of emphasis while still feeling like a pattern-based old map. There's some very snappy movement and heavy slider velocity manipulation which you just wouldn't see back then. Again, I can't stress this enough. This was made before [Gold Dust](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/28107). If this map had a leaderboard back then, the (present) future of mapping would have probably been very, very different. Perhaps for the better.

An Easter song going up for Loved voting a month late, but better late than never I suppose!

You might have seen this map in the [osu! ALLSTARS 3 showmatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhHHZX_Jh24&t=2221s) when it had one of the team names be "LADYBABY enjoyers". It was also featured as a HD1 in the mappool. **8.32★** and pentagons. Need I say more? Of course, I do. While the main difficulty of this map comes from the two kiais that feature pentagons, holding a combo throughout is no easy feat. I like to think of this map as the true snap aim test with the amount of times you need to snap. 68,000+ play count and 100+ favorites show that many people do in fact Love this map.

Want to see this map in a Loved state? Go vote now!

I actually prefer to be ti— *Ahem*, let's just pretend that part of the beatmap description doesn't exist.

One of the most popular maps from [OWC'21](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2021), [Camo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5194391)'s map of [Tie me down gently](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1621830#osu/3311238) has secured itself as a staple among any tournament mappool. Constant awkward aim and slider aim control keeps your fingers dancing whether you're playing NM, HR (bonus points!!) or that *other mod* that won't be mentioned for my own sake... This is, of course, assuming you're probably a normal player and not one of [three](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) [types](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11415230) of [aliens](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2035254).

Anyways, one vote for this map means one less HD map in your mappool that's a 250 BPM burst check map disguised as what those snarky mappoolers call "density". Your local charity full of [snail aim players](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5477343) will be ecstatic to see this one again!

[Marisa wa Taihen na Mono wo Nusunde Ikimashita](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/843777#taiko), also known as *Marisa Stole The Precious Thing*, is a very well-known *Touhou* song from IOSYS, loved by many around the world! The map I've picked here from [Axer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7299864) is one of the best to represent the song, doing so in such a mechanically unique way that separates itself from those like it. It has many unique SVs but is paired with simplistic mapping that is accessible to all... wait.

Oh right, and near the end there's a 1/8 death stream?! Luckily the pattern is simple to play, but can you stand up to the challenge? Give it a shot, but you might need No Fail. ;)

Destroying keyboards is the favorite past time of taiko players, but in order to reach such level of intensity and skill, maps like [Arrival](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1694000)'s [asteria - FUSION](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1723980#taiko/3523339) are absolutely needed for progression. This map offers a comfortable yet challenging range of streams and bursts, backed up by the hyperpop nature of the song.

It's no wonder why this map has been featured in several tournaments, especially in rounds where the overall mappool difficulty is yet to reach its peak. Maps like this allow you to look back one day and admire how far you have come. It's for this reason we are giving it the chance of acquiring a leaderboard to immortalize your scores. You have the final say, so go ahead and give it a try!

Calling all taiko masochists! This month, [monoqlom - tatari](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/644401#taiko/1365782) by [applerss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/983349) is up for Loved vote! A map name that may have sent shivers down the spines of some reading, *tatari* is a gruelingly intense yet incredibly fun map that has become very well known to top players due to its sheer difficulty.

Coming in at close to 9 stars and consisting of numerous 290 BPM streams throughout the duration of the map, most of which are 50–100 notes long, it is almost immediately obvious to anyone playing *tatari* that they are in for a serious challenge. However, *tatari* exceeds expectations and undoubtedly peaks in difficulty in the 2nd kiai, which consists of a single finger-cramping **249-note stream** which is sure to be a challenge even for seasoned players.

While *tatari* does include some breaks and less dense sections, these feel less like breaks and more like mercy, and it is never long before the map's difficulty and density ramps back up. While this means *tatari* lives up to its difficulty name of "Hell", it also makes the map feel massively rewarding and serves itself as a great test of speed, stamina and streams.

Do you have what it takes?

The \[Rain\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)*

This time we are going to travel 10 years to the past, or at least that's how it will feel like, as this map was uploaded by [CelegaS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1552429) in 2014.

Some people might wonder why we should care about something that was uploaded such a long time ago, and the answer is simple: because it's fun! Experiencing these older mapping styles that are vastly different from nowadays — doesn't that sound exciting? Something you don't really get in the Ranked section and feels very unique to play. That's exactly this map.

Unlike a lot of difficult old maps, this one does not feel unfair in any way. It is reasonable and playable while still maintaining its unique style and it doesn't rely on the player's luck. However, that does not mean this map is easy. It will still be tricky to do well on for most players, as the map contains a healthy dose of challenging patterns. If you are into older mapping styles, this will be a blast.

Give it a try! Despite its age, it's a fantastic map.

Soulless this, soulless that. The series is getting a bit soulless now, right?

Perhaps you may be tired of seeing *Soulless* pop up in the Loved section, but this one is quite important, as it finishes off the series that has grown since the beginning of [Kyptoric](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1361268)'s infamous map of [Soulless 4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/772138#fruits/1623653), which also consists of [Soulless 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/772138#fruits/1623653) and [Soulless 3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/785482#fruits/1648975).

Mapped by none other than the legendary mapper [Sutavv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5320583), notable for their previously Loved maps including [Crisis City](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1205520#fruits/3812397) and [Obsidian](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1130748#fruits/2361985), I present to you [Soulless 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1285325#fruits/2668725). Despite the map being less challenging than *Soulless 4* and *Soulless 3*, it harbors plenty of the now-classic hyperwalk gimmick mixed in with some streams and other classic *Soulless* patterns from Soulless 3 and 4 in this map.

I hope you enjoy this ExileLord classic. Here's to the [BEW pattern](/wiki/shared/news/2024-04-16-project-loved-april-2024/BEW-pattern.jpg) and the *Guitar Hero*/*Clone Hero* enjoyers.

[-Izayoi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5710721) has been around for quite some time now, so they require little to no introduction if you have played a bit of osu!catch.

In my opinion, this beatmap is perfect when you want to slowly work towards the higher end of beatmaps while also building consistency. It's a lengthy song at 5 minutes and 34 seconds, but it builds up quite well. It doesn't start too fast, allowing you to warm up and prepare for the build-up around the middle of the map.

It features various patterns, from jumps to streams, kick-sliders, and even some sliders with droplets that can be quite tricky to catch if you aren't too comfortable with them.

Are you ready to take on [GHOST](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/643481#fruits/1364012)?

*description written by [Paturages](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479)*

2017 was 7 years ago.

In seven years, we've seen many discoveries and much progress in the realm of SVs, but once in a while, it's refreshing to dive back into old files and see how things used to be. Wait, didn't we just go over this last month? Are we stuck in an endless time loop?

Okay, hear me out. While last month's [Mastermile](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7312902)'s [super anime groove 3d world](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/663203#mania) was very simplistic in its approach and very affordable, [Couil](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6872025)'s *PUMP* is a lot more abrasive in its patterning to contrast. The song choice by itself is absolutely iconic: if you hear *PUMP*'s drop just once, you will recognize it from a mile away. Its catchiness and sharpness have a way of worming themselves into your brain and never leaving it, and that's how you get all-time classics in the rhythm game circle.

The catchiness and sharpness of the song are directly relevant to how this map was approached: outside of the drops, no SVs are used at all. It's the calm before the storm. The comfort of the build-up will lead you to bounce up and down in your chair when the climax eventually comes. What am I even writing at this point? They're letting me cook way too hard. Enter the drop, and the meat of the map starts: stutter and transitive SVs for emphasis, 180 BPM minijacks on vocal cuts, and really tough SV-to-burst transitions. The map may be mostly normalized and readable, but the way it shifts back and forth, and stops and starts, makes it really challenging to get right. Most people have to play this through anticipation of patterns and reading ahead.

Physical SVs are part of a skill set that has not been represented at all in recent tournaments due to its relative unpopularity, and especially due to how frustrating it is to push scores that translate into earning a well-deserved point in a match. But it definitely has its niche, and many physical SVs are still greatly enjoyed by people nowadays. Therefore, we think it's still worth representing in the Loved category.

Feel free to tell us what you think in the voting thread, and *PUMP* your vote in!

I remember starting to see [Smokydoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/20169884)'s mapping when they first started and it is really great to see how far they have come. I am happy to announce that their chart of [Dat Phonk](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1964340#mania/4072974) will be pushed for Loved this wave.

It's been a while since a "hard" (kinda stupid to say since I know we will see crazy scores on this map) chordjack map has been pushed for Loved, and to give those players who enjoy these kinds of charts some love, we decided on a chart this hard. Featuring 157 BPM triples and quads, this is a challenge even for those who are really good at chordjacks. Even though the song may be short at less than 2 minutes, it still is a struggle to stay consistent when the speed is so quick.

The phonk genre of music has been growing a lot in popularity, especially in these kinds of charts, so if you want to see more dense chordjacks or if you like phonk songs be sure to vote "yes" on this map!

The lack of [UNDEAD CORPORATION](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/45) songs in both Ranked and Loved in osu!mania is honestly astonishing to me. To compensate for this, we will be advocating for [Embraced by the Flame](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1349838#mania/2794755) as charted by [Punnies](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8700468) to become Loved. While many players may recognize Punnies for their various jumpstream charts, this particular Loved chart caters more to stamina-oriented players.

The chart is packed with jumpstream sequences and consistent transitions between trills, making it a delight for jumpstream enthusiasts. Furthermore, with a duration of 4 minutes, players must ensure that their hands can keep up without requiring a break. Nevertheless, there are pauses throughout the map, providing players with the ability to cool off and save their hands. Additionally, for those seeking an extra challenge, higher rates are available, including speeds up to 300 BPM.

If you're eager to test your skills, take on the challenge of this fiery map. Just be aware that if you're not prepared, you may find yourself swallowed up. However, for those who are prepared, the sense of warmth you will feel will be truly rewarding. As always, if you wish to see more of Punnies' maps in the Loved category in the future, or if you simply enjoy this style of mapping, don't forget to vote "yes" for this map!

Dans! We all love dans. I know nothing about dans. But you will! I'm sure of it, as you'll likely recognize\
[The Bird's Midair Heatstroke (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2153107#mania) charted by [samurai7694](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/35590399).

While I do admit I don't know much about dans, I will say that I do know that this is featured in the [6th Dan Reform Marathon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/887733#mania/1855674), so it's undoubtedly on the easier side of what's been featured in those packs. Even then, there's still popularity coming from *Etterna*, as it was also put in the [Rebound Dump Collection Megapack](https://etternaonline.com/pack/9753). If you think we'd stop there, this also has a great amount of plays in [Flash Flash Revolution](https://www.flashflashrevolution.com/levelstats.php?level=2248), so the least you can get out of this is, well, people like this, and we're finally given the ability to put it up for voting.

The chart is what you'd expect from anything remotely FFRcore, containing heavy bursts, minijacks, longjacks, and everything of the type. All these patterns paired with a Terminal 11 song, and you've got practically the epitome of anything FFR. While most people are used to playing this on its base rate, you're still given rates up to 1.1x for the extra challenge. It might not sound like much, but this scales rapidly on rates.

We all recognize this, so instead of hearing me repeat over and over again that this is popular, go ahead and vote yes.

I don't think I can name a better trio than [hi19hi19](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1014473), tech mapping, and mashcore. Originally charted in *Stepmania*, [OWA Raged in Vegas (Fuck Bees)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1671141#mania/3413314) has been gaining popularity in osu! ever since it was used in [MWC 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K) during Semifinals at 1.05x.

This chart is what is to be expected from your average tech chart. There are relentless anchor patterns where you are constantly switching between fingers, as well as constant bursts of minijack to mess up your coordination. Given that the map has a length of 3:30, staying consistent through the whole map is not an easy task, even with all the breaks. Speaking of the breaks, all of those are still littered with awkward patterns which, if you are not prepared for, will make you at least drop a few 200s.

This chart has been well known for a few years now and I think it's about time for it to finally get the leaderboard it deserves. If you swear that you like hi19 charts then you will not want to miss out on hitting the "yes" button.

Being notorious as the third map in [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750)'s 15th Long Note Dan Course, [White Hair Little Swords Girl](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1117284#mania) proves to be a really difficult challenge, with even some of the best long note players in the world struggling in a chart like this. With a rich history of being a part of the Loved community (not to mention, having 7 maps already being selected for Project Loved), \_underjoy gets another one of his charts nominated, and certainly not one to be slept on as well.

To give you a perspective of how difficult this chart can be, just imagine being forced to play 255 BPM trill-heavy and unorthodox jumpstreams, but converted into a very dense long note map. Not only would it require you to have an immense amount of stamina and physicality, but it would also require you to have a well-established set of coordination fundamentals. Both being a necessity at the same time makes this one of the hardest charts that you could ever see in the LN density category.

As such, this chart is really one of the most daunting tests of stamina, coordination, and physicality you will ever get from a long note chart.

Considering its popularity and also the various challenges it may present to you, it has to be time that this map FINALLY gets the recognition that it should get. If you think that this map fits into the Loved category, don't hesitate and vote "YES" now!

This is one of the more classic [ruka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6117525) maps that a ton of players have been enjoying ever since it was uploaded!

From conventional long note patterning to abstract and more *O2Jam*-style long notes, this map serves as an entry point for players who are beginning to play maps of the upper level of difficulty.

Fun and challenging would describe this map the best! Having no gimmicks, this is a test of consistency and being able to read dense long note patterns.
