**633397** is best known for their ominously titled breakcore tunes that incorporate elements from across the genre spectrum. Given [his background in osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11392390), it should come as no surprise that **633397** pulls inspiration from well-known figures in the osu! space like [goreshit](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/57), [Camellia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31), [Kobaryo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/96), and [Kurokotei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/398275)!

**18** breakcore-adjacent tunes have just moved into [**633397**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/419). If you want housewarming gift ideas, a beatmap might be a good choice.

In the words of **633397**...

> osu! and the artists I discovered by playing it is what made me get into music production in the first place, and it makes me so happy that I'm able to give back to the community after all this time. I hope I also inspire people in the same way.

Start mapping with a pre-timed beatmap template from [**633397**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/419) (and stay tuned for another artist next week!).
