No one has been eliminated yet, but consistency is the name of the game as teams decide who will keep fighting among the winners and who will be cast down to the losers' bracket!

The stakes for all teams will only start to increase from here and everyone is keeping their wits about them as the mappools grow ever so slightly more difficult. That doesn't stop our contestants from setting some *seriously impressive* plays, however, even this early on into the tournament.

While the overall difficulty of the pool hasn't increased by a considerable margin, it hasn't stopped players from dropping their guard. It's precisely in earlier rounds where consistency reigns supreme and every little slip-up counts.

## Round of 16 results

Before proceeding to the highlighted matches, let's quickly remind ourselves of what the final scores were for Round of 16:

## Match highlights

### ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan vs. ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=v2045221189&parent=osu.ppy.sh&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Japan is a rice team. With this year's incorporation of the BMS legend ::{ flag=JP }:: [butanic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1433586) (current global #6 and someone who has been a top BMS player [since before osu!mania existed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRugloVbRV8)), he and ::{ flag=JP }:: [rainlily](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/485007) form a practically unbeatable duo in rice charts. In Qualifiers, they were 1st overall in 2/4 rice-focused charts, and 2nd in the other two. They are capable of extraordinary accuracy up to an astounding physical level. However... this isn't BMS. This is osu!mania. Here, there are Long Notes. And Poland *knew that*.

So, coming into the match, the strategy was clear. The eternal "rice vs. noodles" clash, which has happened and will surely happen again many times in this very tournament. The tone was set immediately with butanic's 997.8k SS on [skymuted & Evin a`k - Memory at Angels Landing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2123235#mania/4461947), the chordstream pick. But Poland responded, with the veteran player ::{ flag=PL }:: [DaDarkDragon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8902097) leading the way to take the next point with [Y&Co. - POODLE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2123243#mania/4461965), the LN density pick.

And just after that, one of the most extraordinary exhibits of consistency we've seen so far, Japan's BMS duo getting a double 999k on the Jack pick [Frums - Wavetapper](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2123274#mania/4462022), with the players getting 24 and 30 GREATs (300s) respectively.

More blows were traded afterwards, with Poland picking up a second point on the Hard Hybrid [ZxNX - Fana](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2123269#mania/4462015), before finally ending the match 5–2 in favour of Japan. Don't forget about Poland though, as they are sure to become a fierce competitor in the lower bracket.

### ::{ flag=AU }:: Australia vs. ::{ flag=BR }:: Brazil

The second day of action opened with a matchup touted to be the closest of the entire weekend, and not just because of their seeds (8th and 9th). Australia barged into the tournament after missing out on the action last year. Brazil, on the other hand, wants to maintain the momentum they built up last weekend.

As mentioned, the "rice vs noodles" strategy is once again at play here. Australia opted to open their campaign with HB1, [Juggernaut - Invoke](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2123292#mania/4462083), and grabbed their first point. Brazil replied with a point coming off RC1 [(goreshit - toromi hearts 2 (Sped Up Ver.))](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2123251#mania/4461979), and a very nutty 994k ScoreV1 SS from ::{ flag=BR }:: [SillyFangirl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2288363).

Both teams traded points on their favoured skill sets for the next 3 charts. Australia managed to grab the first break point of the match on RC3, [Frums - Wavetapper](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2123274#mania/4462022), with shout-outs to ::{ flag=AU }:: [my angel zhla](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6378800) for grabbing a 997k score on it. This run also secured match point for the land down under — however, their South American counterparts had other plans. Brazil scored on the next two charts coming off two phenomenal plays from SillyFangirl, forcing the tiebreaker.

The tiebreaker, while titled "[sub/zerO](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2123291#mania/4462082)", was anything but. The two teams, truly toe to toe, stayed in each other's tow, until we saw the players crack under the pressure. Australia held on the longer between the two teams and pulled away to end this thrilling match, 5–4.

### Individual score highlights

During this week's round there were a couple of amazing plays that happened during matches that did not get highlighted, but still deserve a shout-out:

- ::{ flag=JP }:: [butanic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1433586) has been around the VSRG community for a long while. While people know they're a beast, this was their tournament debut. And what a way to start things off getting [996k](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2045221189) on [The Flashbulb - Ninedump](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2123256#mania/4461987).
- The rice scores don't stop there though, as Japan and Korea managed to get a surprisingly close team score in [Frums - Wavetapper](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2123274#mania/4462022), both getting 53 and 56 GREATs respectively.
- The highlights on [Frums - Wavetapper](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2123274#mania/4462022) don't stop, as ::{ flag=KR }:: [dressurf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/758406) managed to upscore ::{ flag=JP }:: [butanic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1433586) by a single GREAT!
