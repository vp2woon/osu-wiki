The people have spoken! Let's go through what has the community crowned as 2023's Community Choice and Mapper's Favourite for each mode!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/195/header.jpg)

[In case you've missed it](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-01-29-community-choice-2023-open), the *Community Choice* polls are a yearly event where players and mappers alike come to unity in order to determine which maps of the past year were the best of the best.

Just like last year, the *Mapper's Favourite* category only considers mappers that have had at least 1 map ranked in the contest's respective game mode in order to keep results for said category more faithful to people's expectations.

As per usual, all contributors to a winning mapset for either *Community Choice* picks or *Mapper's Favourite* picks will receive the profile badge prize, alongside the osu!supporter prize being divided among all contributors, with every contributor receiving at least 1 month's worth of osu!supporter no matter how many there are. You may discover why we're doing this as you're reading along.

Without further delay, let's get straight into the results!

Spinning its way to the top, [**IOSYS - Hinarin no Yakui Kankei (Edit ver.)**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2088431) has taken the breath of voters with its eccentric, yet amusing gameplay.

Brought to life by [Luscent](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2688581) for the [osu! World Cup 2023 Semifinals](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2023#semifinals) with the help of guest mappers [Amateurre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7326908), [allein](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6221637), and [Down](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4694602), this banger of a map will surely resonate endlessly in your head with its catchy chorus.

For the most authentic experience, we highly recommend playing this map on osu!(lazer) ([which you can download here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/download)) with the *Barrel Roll* mod on! To better elaborate, here's a video of seasoned player [Ekoro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/284905) demonstrating exactly what we mean:

### Mapper's Favourite

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-12-community-choice-2023-results/1976834.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1976834)

The osu!taiko mapping community has decided to crown [**BilliumMoto & Dictate - 1KARUGA**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1976834) as their favourite set of 2023!

Created by the joint prowess of 2 mapping titans [HiroK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4050738) and [uone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5321719) for the [osu!taiko World Cup 2023 Finals tiebreaker](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2023#finals), it sets some high expectations to live up to, and to the surprise of no one, it *exceeds* them. Featuring all kinds of intricate and obscure snaps (some of which don't even exist in the current set of snap divisors), HiroK and uone perfectly capture the incredibly chaotic essence of the song in a way that's both fun and challenging to play.

[Rocma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276)'s [**Jea - snows \~Soshite Kiseki\~**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1960673) takes the spotlight of osu!catch's *Community Choice*!

The beatmap is basically 1 very long stream, but the real magic is in the execution of its patterning. Utilising concepts such as symmetry, repetitions, and other convert-styled conventions, it provides a very unique experience that's equally fun to play.
