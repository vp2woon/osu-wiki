![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-03-30-spring-fanart-results/banner.jpg)

With only **15** votes to distribute over **110** entries, it's no secret that choosing the finalists has been a tough nut to crack. But alas, the community has spoken, and now we have our latest batch of Spring 2024 seasonal backgrounds for all to behold and admire here and in the game's main menu!

Enough waiting, let's go through each winning entry in order:

### Finalists

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/Tofumang.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/Tofumang.png)

Taking first place by a sizeable margin, [**Tofumang**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4817223)'s stunning depiction of pippi relaxing in a field of tall grass and enjoying flowers from a more appropriate vantage point, much like the pink butterflies keeping her company, captivated **2203** voters who decided to appreciate this particular moment alongside her.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/KAITO%20thighs.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/KAITO%20thighs.png)

**1915** voters agreed with the vibes of [**KAITO thighs**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233)' (better known as *Dreamxiety*) playful rendition of a catgirl pippi experiencing direct contact with a field of anemones.

By voting on this entry, they've also agreed to play osu!catch. Friends, it is on your honour to uphold your end of this one.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/LeeNarie.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/LeeNarie.jpg)

**1855** onlookers took the invitation by [**LeeNarie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2667849) for a picnic with pippi, Aiko, Chirou, Mari and Mocha by the fresh airs of a canal path lined with cherry blossom trees. Don, Taikonator and an oddly familiar cat are there for the ride, too.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/Kwms024.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/Kwms024.png)

**1833** voters were divided into two groups: those struck by nostalgia upon the sight of "pippi Goku" on a Flying Nimbus along with Mocha, Don and Yuzu in an amazing and unexpected crossover, and those who simply appreciated [**Kwms024**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11516014)'s detailed artwork of a hard-working gardener pippi.

There's probably some overlap between the two.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/Amplui.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/Amplui.png)

**1741** voters dipped their toes into the obscure quietude of [**Amplui**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24820805)'s pippi resting herself in a place that just seems more aligned with her own style, y'know.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/tehfire.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/tehfire.jpg)

**1508** of you could not resist taking a closer look at [**tehfire**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7082924)'s rosy scene of pippi and Mocha in a rose garden, where Mocha in her roseate attire seems to have made herself too captivating for pippi to handle.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/kohiibeans.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/kohiibeans.png)

[**kohiibeans**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/34834104)'s chill pippi in a field of white azaleas and a cherry blossom tree resonated with **1424** astute watchers, who we're sure also noticed the *FREEDOM DiVE* orbs and our frequently appearing feline friend.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/Black%20Lynx.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/Black%20Lynx.jpg)

**1409** voters saw a cute maid pippi and mocha (and Don) doing cute things at a picnic, and just couldn't help but be jealous of the tasty snacks [**Black Lynx**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1193814) is letting them have.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/Partyu.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/Partyu.png)

Mermaid Mocha, perhaps not entirely content with her predicament, managed to entrance **1359** viewers of [**Partyu**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12659629)'s gorgeous rendition of her surrounded by water lilies (alongside a certain Don-chan chilling unhelpfully in the background).

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/mocapixel.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/mocapixel.png)

Mocha relaxing by a creek lined with a colourful selection of flowers, complete with both familiar characters and interesting guests, did not cause hesitation in **1318** pixel art enthusiasts giving [**mocapixel**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11596939)'s artwork the attention it deserves.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/Kourihase.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/Kourihase.png)

**1286** individuals were brought to a smile by [**Kourihase**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13298982)'s lively scene of our cast up to some picnic shenanigans.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/Sjao.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/Sjao.png)

**1214** people followed [**Sjao**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7295733) pippi in appreciating some floral nature together with pippi, who is wearing a stylish outfit complete with a cute lily hairclip.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/Type.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/Type.png)

[**Type**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7520534)'s more elegant, aristocratic, chestnut-haired pippi charmed **1202** voters with impeccable class, an equally exquisite rose, and what looks like very large lilies.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/roadcrow__.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/roadcrow__.png)

[**roadcrow__**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11752694) stole the breath of **1106** voters, catching them eternally dwelling in pippi's absolutely mesmerising gaze, entranced in what could only be interpreted as a splendid view of a cherry blossom landscape.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/Dika312.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/Dika312.png)

**1051** voters were delighted to see [**Dika312**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/741613)'s rendition of pippi rocking her own Chirou-themed attire while basking in a sea of diverse flora.

### peppy's Picks

Whenever we're hard at work in the osu! offices preparing the grand reveal of our beloved fanart contests, it has been said that a certain Dean "peppy" Herbert keeps a stark but subtle gaze upon the entries, waiting for that one piece to truly capture his heart to bless it with the almighty power of The Pickâ„¢, should the public not give it its deserved justice.

This time, **6** entries have left The Dean in a state of awe, so, we did the one thing that must be done and included them in here!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/MapleSpe.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/MapleSpe.jpg)

[**MapleSpe**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/20991449) has pippi, Chirou and Mocha visit a breathtaking garden lined with trees full of blooming cherry blossoms lit by *INCREDIBLY* bright sunlight.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/-_Y_u_m_i_J_i-.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/-%20Y%20u%20m%20i%20J%20i-.jpg)

[**- Y u m i J i-**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7656048)'s incredibly unique style permeates a scene of a stylish pippi elegantly glancing at her appropriately pink-coloured backyard from atop a tree branch... Oh dear, be careful up there!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/Yuri%20Enjoyer.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/Yuri%20Enjoyer.png)

peppy was questioned for his choice of this artwork by [**Yuri Enjoyer**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6961543). Here's what he had to say for himself:

![but cuteness factor](/wiki/shared/news/2024-03-30-spring-fanart-results/peppy-response.png)

...Can't argue with that.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/AyoLie.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/AyoLie.png)

[**AyoLie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/29186645) shows us what pippi, Mocha, Mari, Chirou and Aiko are up to while there's some downtime from their studies. What better way to spend it, than to gaze upon flowers and butterflies of all colours!

Also, someone seems to be up to date on the newest trends, having acquired one of the coveted "Don" keychains...

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/Maqmoon.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/Maqmoon.png)

[**Maqmoon**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/33452645) lets us peek into a lovely tea time between pippi and Mocha, feeling the breeze of the outside and the floral fragrances of the indoor garden... where a conspicuous Don seems to be having a lovely time too.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/banners/Loichuu.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/205/winners/Loichuu.png)

[**Loichuu**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/460210) brings us pippi and Tama on a break from gardening duties, but oh no! Tama drops her water bottle and it bounces off in the direction of a whole slew of osu! mascot characters! Can you identify them all?
