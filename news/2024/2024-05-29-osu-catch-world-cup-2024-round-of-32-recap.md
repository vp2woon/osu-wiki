![](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2024/img/cwc2024-banner.jpg)

As the qualifiers concluded, the top 32 teams that will battle it out for the title of osu!catch World Cup winner were announced. At the top of the pack is the big favourite to win it all this year, the United States, qualifying 1st for the second year in a row with 7 top scores out of 9 maps. Joining them on the qualification podium this year are Poland and Finland, both teams getting their best qualification result to date.

Going further down the list, we see Estonia qualifying 32nd, just right above the cut-off for the first time in ten years. Iceland, the sole debutant of this year, defied all expectations and ended up 30th on the qualification list and are making their World Cup debut in the Round of 32.

Let's get into the mappool, the results and the highlights of last week's matches.

The Round of 32 mappool is a clear step down in difficulty compared to the difficulty of the qualifier mappool. This makes it more comfortable to play for all teams and provides more exciting points between teams that are closely matched.

The most picked map in the pool this weekend is [Ironical Parade](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2183882#fruits/4615165), the HR1 mapped by [wwwww](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8434466) and [Yoshi_green](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1035891). The fairly conventional mapping with a focus on various stream patterns provided for a pleasant experience for both players and viewers. Our fruit catchers aren't very fond of the no-mod bracket as both [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184377#fruits/4617105) and [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184055#osu/4615558) only saw 3 appearances over all matches.

## Match highlights

### ::{ flag=SE }:: Sweden vs. ::{ flag=AU }:: Australia

Starting off the weekend early on Saturday, Sweden faced off against Australia. Sweden, seeded 14th, has joined the tournaments with high hopes as their roster this year managed to acquire their best qualification result since the format was introduced in 2022. However, their adversary Australia has managed to end up in the top 16 of the three past world cups and therefore isn't to be underestimated.

Australia managed to convert their own pick on [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184033#fruits/4615512) into a point and were also able to grab a first breakpoint against Sweden on their [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184059#fruits/4615567) pick, V-Pop. To make matters worse for Sweden, Australia were able to also win the next two maps ([HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2183882#fruits/4615165) and [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184044#fruits/4615540)) to already put themselves on match point. Sweden, the higher seed in this encounter, were with their backs against the wall, but were able to grab a breakpoint of their own on Australia's [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184049#fruits/4615549) pick. Unfortunately they were not able to stop Australia on their second match point as they won [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184054#fruits/4615557) with a double FC from ::{ flag=AU }:: [Beerus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5529199) and ::{ flag=AU }:: [TheTixTop](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19236870), ending the match in 5–1 in favour of Australia.

Sweden will drop down to the loser bracket where they will face Iceland in the Round of 16, whilst Australia continue their run in the winner bracket and are preparing themselves for a matchup against Finland.

### ::{ flag=CN }:: China vs. ::{ flag=NL }:: the Netherlands

Another matchup on Saturday saw three time world champion China, albeit with a newly revamped roster, take on the Netherlands. The Netherlands have made a name for themselves as giant killers after their amazing comeback and match victory against top seed Indonesia in the 2023 World Cup, and many expected them to achieve a similar feat this year against team China.

The Netherlands took an early 2–1 lead and were on the brink of winning the next two maps as well. However, on both [MM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184097#fruits/4615639) and [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184033#fruits/4615512), China were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat as they overtook the Netherlands twice in the ending sections of both maps. Not too demoralised by their two losses, the Netherlands tied things up at 3 a piece going into the last pick of each team. China were able to win on their [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184055#osu/4615558) pick even when the Dutch star player ::{ flag=NL }:: [b-a-d-s123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3656717) SS'ed the pick. Going into the final pick of the match, the Netherlands opted to go [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184044#fruits/4615540) and drafted a roster of ::{ flag=NL }:: [Dutchman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10552580), ::{ flag=NL }:: [Sartan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4100941) and b-a-d-s123. They start off really well and build a substantial lead of 13,000 points going into the last 20 seconds of the map. They've lost MM2 in the ending sections of the map, they've lost NM3 when it was already in the bag, surely they won't lose now, right?

In an absolutely dramatic turn of events, a single drop from the Dutch team overturns their lead in the final seconds of the map, giving China a 5th point on the board and securing them the victory. Heartbreak for the Dutchies.

### ::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina vs. ::{ flag=DK }:: Denmark

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

</div>

To close out the weekend on Sunday, seed 7 Argentina took on seed 26 Denmark. Argentina, fielding ::{ flag=AR }:: [-Story-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8172283) as the highest ranked player in the entire tournament, were caught by surprise by team Denmark as they were able to convert the first two maps into two points. Denmark found a surprising weakness in the Mixed Mod bracket on the Argentinian team and utilised it to perfection. However, before the third map started, the veteran for the Argentinian team ::{ flag=AR }:: [VelperK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/348467) joined the lobby. VelperK's first appearance in the osu!catch World Cup dates back to 2013, and he used this experience to absolutely obliterate the entire lobby for the next 30 minutes. He started off with a full combo on [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184377#fruits/4617105), then proceeded to SS [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2183882#fruits/4615165), before continuing on and full combo-ing the remaining three maps to close out the match 5–2.

## Round statistics

To top this week's recap off, here are a couple of interesting statistics to share:

- ::{ flag=RU }:: [KitsunIvy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7055384) and ::{ flag=AR }:: [VelperK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/348467) both managed to full combo all 5 maps they played in this round, both having zero misses on their record for the bracket stage of this CWC.

- ::{ flag=US }:: [Lexii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7226149) managed to top the performance leaderboard on both the qualifiers and the Round of 32.
- We saw a couple of triple FCs over the weekend, such as Chile on [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184059#fruits/4615567) and Netherlands on [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2183882#fruits/4615165), however team Argentina was the sole team to achieve a triple SS this weekend, achieving this incredible feat on [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2184034#fruits/4615516).
