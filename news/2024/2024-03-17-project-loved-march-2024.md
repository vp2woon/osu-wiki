Celebrate St. Patrick's Day with some jolly Loved picks!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

In case you've been at the other end of the rainbow, or are new to the community, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As always, thanks to all the participants in the voting for the February round! If you would like to view the results from the previous round, visit the following links:

This Popular Playcounts pick is also a bit of a Ranked Reject... and also an Outstanding Oldie. But we're not taking spots from anyone here, as the playcount here shows why this map was so popular in the day.

[xi - Glorious Crown](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/460515#osu), mapped by [Anxient](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4561368), has beautifully crafted streams, finger control, kicksliders, and just the raw feeling of an overwhelmingly intense song. It's *FREEDOM DiVE 2*, as most people have described it. It's also quite accessible, which is why we see this beatmap still get plays even after seven years. It also features a full mapset, courtesy of difficulties by [toybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2848604), [SnowNiNo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2506267), and [Lama Poluna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4581039). There's a little something for everyone, and it really makes you FEEL like the *Glorious Crown*.

Azer isn't so great? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a mapper with such marathon mapping ability and knowledge with an editor? Alex puts the mapping game on another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a mapper with his skill and passion for the game again. Skystar breaks records. jonathanlfj breaks records. Azer breaks the rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the magic.

The Small Spectacles pick for this month is *asteria - i didn't need you anyway* by nooj.

Blasting a mixture between dariacore and hyperpop on full blast, [nooj](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8271086) has created one hidden gem of a modern tech map. Don't let the star rating of 7.19★ trick you — the map is filled with high-velocity sliders and unorthodox patterning that suits the chaotic nature of the song, so hitting slider ends is a difficulty of its own. These 3 minutes of high-end and fast-paced intensity are beautifully crafted and it manages to be fun and engaging throughout, so if this map seems to be part of your taste, then make sure to vote it for Loved!

*description written by [Skill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7802027)*

The Daredevil Difficulty for this month is [BarkingMadDog](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3475189)'s map of [wowaka - Unhappy Refrain](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1075607#osu/2250670). Overdue, isn't it?

This was originally mapped for the [2019 osu! World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2019) as NM1 in Grand Finals, as some might remember this was the map USA closed off the most dominating performance in osu! World Cup history. Since then it's become a very iconic map as most people's go-to when playing an aim map, reflected in the 70,000+ plays and 150+ favorites.

This map is very self-explanatory if you're familiar with the infamous duo of BarkingMadDog and NM1's. Big jumps, consistently difficult, spaced bursts to finish off the kiais, just an overall difficult **7.35★** consistency aim map. [I'll let the OWC VOD do the explaining if you've still never seen the map.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUCCO6Vt7-Q&t=3870s)

First uploaded in 2013 and unfortunately left to the throes of the graveyard after all of these years, [Lyapis Trubetskoy - Tantsuy!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/129658#osu/327496) created by the legendary [Natteke](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/157177), and featuring guest difficulties by [Vass_Bass](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/188248), [Nemis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1635091), and [Jounzan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1848318) (also known as EvilElvis or Natteke desu), finally gets its chance to shine!

This fan-favorite *Ranked Reject* is a short yet sweet experience with a runtime of 1 minute and 51 seconds, and has a difficulty for all skill levels, so there's definitely something to enjoy for everyone. The mapset itself features rhythms, patterns, and difficulty settings common for Natteke's offerings, all from an exciting song choice. There really isn't much else to ask for.

Give the mapset a spin — there's a lot of enjoyment to be had within its difficulties. And if you want this mapset to finally earn the leaderboard it deserves, now is your chance to vote!

Gameplay Gimmicks: Introducing the *reading map*

Originally mapped for [banger bonanza](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1282642?n=1) and featured later on in [OWC'23](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2023), [ScubDomino](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8972308)'s [SUNKiSS♥DROP](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1498309#osu/3070802) has cemented itself as an anchor in any reading player's arsenal. Perfect overlaps, awkward aim, the clock pattern, AR8 density, the clock pattern, the clock pattern, did I mention the clock pattern yet? Don't worry about it though surely you won't develop any mindblock on it... for sure...

Anyways... give it a spin! Whether you're actually trying to play the map, playing it for the fire DDR track, or [missing on the clock pattern](https://www.twitch.tv/rrelrel/clip/AntsyAssiduousSaladPupper-7f-AhceIspXl61wq?filter=clips&range=all&sort=time), I'm sure you'll be having a wonderful time!! (haha get it time clock yeah)

Ohhh my gahh! This is it! The day [CatPiss](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1229831#osu) is getting picked for Project Loved!! I wish I were a bird...\
Live Osaka reaction: 😐

Mapped by world-class mappers [Dayno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10634465) and [MrPotato](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2787415) and inspired by the name of the song, *CatPiss* features a, well.. CatPiss mapping style with an insanely well-crafted storyboard!! I mean, come on!! *CatPiss* is literally the opposite of—, oh wait, I can't say that one can I...?

Moving along, it's probably best to mention that if you will manage to somehow FC this map, Chiyo's father will bless you with eternal happiness! But wait!! Sakaki might steal your height if you miss! How awful!!

And that's just the tip of the iceberg!!

Come on! What can go wrong?! Are you really planning to let *CatPiss* from Azumanga Daioh slip through the Loved category? Vote now!!

Akin to his other Loved map [fffff](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1290926#osu/2679663), *Rave 2 Rave* locks you in with non-stop cutstreams and crazy aim control patterns awaiting at each corner of your screen.

*description written by [vyper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9948665)*

The second *Wildcard* pick for this month will be [Riverside - The Magic Valleys of Dark Wolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1267263#osu/2633689), a custom map for Corsace Open 2020 mapped by none other than [LMT](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7262798)!

The map is 185 BPM and sits at a respectable low 7-star range, making it a fun challenge for stream players alike. Clocking at 3 minutes and 49 seconds, you'll be treated with the highest quality of crazy, winding, and spaced streams to get your fingers moving. This is the kind of set where you mostly don't have to worry about lots of wide-angled jumps or unorthodox patterns, so you can just focus on the streams.

Personally, I think this set is awesome, and if you think so too, then make sure to give your honest vote!

A lot of people *love* this one, don't they? Nearly 90,000 plays and over 130 favorites definitely shows that. The **7.18★** top difficulty is similar to the already well-known and Loved [Nyan Nyan Drive](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/106318#osu/279140) but with bigger, less awkward jumps and more streams. **7.18★** AR 10 too difficult for you? Don't worry, there's a **6★** difficulty allowing more players in on the fun!

Vote if you want to see this enter Loved!

Some of you may recognize this map from the [SGTS 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1703263?n=1) Grand Finals pool, and for those who don't, what are you waiting for?!

If you like high SV, low SV, tech or speed, make sure to give to map a try. I'm sure you will at least enjoy one of the sections if you said yes to any of these!

*katagiri - Sendan Life (katagiri Bootleg)* is such a popular track in the entire osu! community that the lack of a taiko version in the Loved category is quite astonishing, considering that every other mode has one. [iceOC's Ranked version](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1118054#taiko/2335441) certainly covers for it with its astounding 170K+ plays, but perhaps due to its Ranked nature, lacks the ''extreme'' characteristic the song normally excels of.

[Roxy-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11931563) and several other known mappers decided to fill that hole, compiling their different approaches into a mapset with over 5K plays. Each diff provides a challenge of its own, and all of them exude an air that can only truly be found on the Loved section of our game mode.

As always, the final say is on you, the players: make sure to give the set a try if you haven't!

This map has aged beautifully with time, still remaining a huge challenge for players at the highest level of skill. Featuring lots of technical movements with unconventional snappings (1/24s!) and overall difficult patterns, this map is definitely not one to be slept on.

A true 2019 classic that would spark a competitive leaderboard among the players who remember the tournaments it was used in.

This map features all kinds of crazy patterns like difficult spacings, cross-screen hyper left-rights, difficult stair and wiggle sections and precision-based stacks.

2017 was 7 years ago.

In seven years, we've seen many discoveries and much progress in the realm of SVs, but once in a while, it's refreshing to dive back into old files and see how things used to be back in the day. [Mastermile's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7312902) *Super Anime Groove 3d World* is one of such mapsets that will send veteran players back into a nostalgia trip.

I've seen this map being thrown around in random multiplayer lobbies before, and this may very well have been one of my first exposures to SV at all. And I'm sure this is the case for many other players, even nowadays. android52's anime remixes have historically made their way on the internet as perhaps one of the major pillars of modern electronic interpretations of pop music as a whole, giving way for future funk's critical acclaim across many parties and living rooms. And to me, it goes without saying that osu! mappers would be drawn into creating content from it.

*Super Anime Groove 3d World*'s approach as a map is quite simplistic: the song choice itself induces the player into a sense of predictability and vibe, and the flow is very much snapped to the main beats. Along with Mastermile's no-nonsense approach with the map, this makes for perhaps one of the best entry points of the SV skillset as a whole, as this map is overall pretty intuitive to grasp, even for non-SV players.

Are you ready to party? Don't headbang too much while playing, because it doesn't necessarily translate into a good score! Instead, give us a vote in the thread, will you?

*description written by [Silhoueska Elze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

*Vocaloid Chordjack Pack* is a plethora of maps made by \[[Crz\]Rachel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8369409), \[[Crz\]hinako1804](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13747903), [7912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14875348), and [Ice V](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12302642). With the amount of chordjack players present nowadays, I'm sure you'd love to have a set of jack maps get into Project Loved!

To start things off, what makes this pack so popular? Well, again, chordjack is one of the more popular patterns in the present era of the 4K scene, and it certainly helps a lot with your physicality overall, as it can benefit other skillsets too due to how much stamina and reading is involved.

Maps like [Electric Angel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1005234#mania/2103854) would dwell more into the physicality range because of its high BPM, and density, with this map potentially being the most difficult out of the entire pack. However, then we have maps like [Heart Chrome](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1005234#mania/2103853) which tests your stamina and reading consistency, and [Baby Maniacs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1005234#mania/2103856), which gives you a run for your money when it comes to single hand–oriented jack patterns.

This pack certainly is a well-balanced trip. It has so much to offer as a jack pack, since it is able to go through most, if not all of what makes chordjack difficult.

Do you want to see how well you'd fare against other top chordjack players? Or do you just want to see how much you have improved in that skillset? In any case, I'm sure the creators of this pack would be glad to receive a favorable vote from you!

[Mipha-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5767941) is certainly no stranger to having created tons of high-quality beatmaps, and one of them has to be [Yozakura](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1180451#mania/2956560).

This beatmap was featured in a few tournaments, particularly the [Springtime Osu!mania Free-For-All Tournament 5th Edition](/wiki/Tournaments/SOFT/5), and also [MWC 4K 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2021_4K) on a faster rate (1.2x). What makes this such a tournament-worthy map would be the mere fact that it tests how well you could execute those speed patterns, which could be difficult because of numerous reasons.

It may not be the fastest speed pick out there, but once again, the patterning makes up for the difficulty of the chart. Being able to read speed picks may be one of the most challenging aspects of ironing yourself out to be a well-balanced tournament player, as this forces you to essentially be both physical and accurate. Let's not forget how relentless this map can be, as it has two speed sections that continue for a very long time. At the very least, there is a long break section, but even that part has some speed sections thrown into it.

Overall, it's a great map that tests your speed capabilities, accuracy, and also consistency, as you get a mix of challenges that can really make you struggle if you come unprepared. Once you can play 1.0x without problems, definitely try these maps at a faster rate!

Do you want to see how well you stand amongst the top players in the rest of the world? Then why not give this map YOUR favorable vote!

Going straight back to 2017, we have a legacy tech pick, [Monk2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/605573#mania/1279446) by [Elekton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4990211).

Used all the way back in the [MWC 4K 2018](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2018_4K) Round of 16 mappool (before the typical pool structure was finally established), *Monk2* still stands out and holds up as an enjoyable chart, being enjoyed by many today. The chart mostly consists of 1/8 bursts and 1/4 minijacks, which aren't much of a challenge at 153 BPM, allowing for something that feels very satisfying to hit. There are definitely harder bursts throughout (ESPECIALLY the part at 01:44:700), but ultimately the accuracy it keeps with the nature of the song just makes this, well, enjoyable.

Don't let the chart's age fool you! Regardless of your skill, go give it a play!

Well, this is certainly something.

By now, you should be no stranger to [BringoBrango](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10274043) and the insanely unique way they chart. If you're familiar with anything of theirs outside of the Ranked section, then you should be no stranger to [Gaucho (cut)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1328388#mania/2751773).

This chart needs studying in a lab. The thought process behind how this was made is something I don't think anyone (including me) will understand. This takes the entire concept of a dump chart and flips it on its head, as majority of the wubs in this song are represented through minijacks, and even some longjacks in smaller parts. Not to mention, but there's a good amount of long notes scattered throughout to add more detail, primarily in the vocals, yet the whole addition of them add to the flow of it very nicely. To sum it up, the end result is... difficult. The already high star rating is severely deceiving, and the song representation is not one I'd imagine many could think of.

It's a shame we may never get the full version, but it definitely isn't a shame that this one-of-a-kind chart is getting a chance at a spot in Loved, so go vote!

As a result, enough time has passed for it to be appropriate to put up something from last year's 4DM, [4DM2023](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/2023), so why not start with [doctormango](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13370527) and [Akatsumi Chan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11306351)'s chart of [Lilith](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2146659#mania/4521765)?

Excluding 2023's [Grand Finals tiebreaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1943786#mania/4021083), *Lilith* ([which had its set ownership transferred](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1942613#mania/4018366)) was without a doubt one of the biggest standouts out of every custom map made, and was also featured in the Grand Finals mappool as a long note coordination pick. As expected of coordination (270 BPM at that), it's going to be VERY tough to hit accurately, and the constant 1/4 note bursts make it no easier. Not to mention, but this is longer than 4 whole minutes? 4-digits are scary...

Anyways, whether you're a 4-digit or not, this is definitely going to pose a challenge on your coordination skills, so it'd be appreciated if you all coordinated your mice to vote yes on this chart!

Cutting straight to the point, [Slaughta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1747998#mania/3575494) was made as a custom for [MWC 4K 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K) and recently found itself in [4DM2024](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/2024), both being used on the 1.1x rate. At this point, it's almost a challenge to have not seen this chart if you're even slightly invested in the tournament scene.

Aside from the song just being good, the chart really reflects the jumpy vibe of the song, as almost every hard pattern consists of 1/6 notes, which are primarily paired alongside some longer streams. Combine that with the releases and column usage, you get a *really* unique long note wildcard.

It's 2024 and you're still playing JAKAZiD? Yes. You're going to vote yes in the thread? Yes.

This chart is a great introduction to hybrid maps with its basic patterning with no gimmicks and straightforward style.

The chordstreams with LN holds are very satisfying to play since the notes are placed in an easy-to-read way throughout the whole chart, which serves as a way for beginner players to get used to intermediate-level patterns and overall higher-density maps.

We believe that Lude deserves another spotlight in the Loved section with this map, so if you agree go ahead and vote for it!

With it sitting at 225 BPM, being close to 5 minutes long, and with its outstanding quality it is truly a challenge that deserves its place in the Loved section. If you agree go ahead and vote for it!
