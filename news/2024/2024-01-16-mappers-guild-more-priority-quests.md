You've mastered the art of placing circles and sliders in the editor. Now it's time to put those skills to the test through this new batch of quests from the **Mappers' Guild**!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/mappersguild.png)

For those out of the loop, the [**Mappers' Guild**](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild) is an MMO-inspired mapping system surrounding osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists).

Mappers can [earn rewards](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#rewards) for completing mapping-related tasks, like ranking maps, participating in contests, and collaborating on [quests](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#quests) (which is what this article is about!).

The Mappers' Guild is open to mappers of any skill level, including those without Ranked maps! See [the system's website](https://mappersguild.com/) or the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy)'s `#mappers-guild` channel for details!

## What are priority quests?

[Just a few months ago](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild), the Mappers' Guild introduced a new way to get involved: [**priority quests**](https://mappersguild.com/missions). These are an alternative to [ordinary Mappers' Guild quests](https://mappersguild.com/quests) with a few key differences:

- **Anyone can participate in priority quests.** Unlike normal quests, you don't need to claim priority quests in advance.
- **Quests are tiered by difficulty:**
  - Tier 1 ![bronze icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/bronze-small.png) (easiest, most common, and lowest reward)
  - Tier 2 ![silver icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/silver-small.png)
  - Tier 3 ![gold icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/gold-small.png)
  - Tier 4 ![platinum icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/platinum-small.png) (hardest, least common, and highest reward)
- Depending on the quest's completion conditions, **multiple users can earn prizes for the same quest**.
- **Priority quests don't last forever.** Maps can be added to priority quests until a deadline is met or a beatmap completes the quest.

By completing priority quests, you can earn some special rewards too:

- All the usual [Mappers' Guild rewards](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#rewards) for ranking beatmaps
- A [**customised keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) based on a pattern in your map
- A profile badge upon completing 3 priority quests

## New priority quests

**6** priority quests have been completed so far. Another **6** have just been added to the [priority quest listing](https://mappersguild.com/missions)!

Unless otherwise stated, each quest ends on **April 30, 2024**.

Here's a quick overview of each quest:

### [Underappreciated Artists v2](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=65a3451cf3b11461108e6fa7)

Some of osu!'s Featured Artists haven't seen much love recently. Create and rank a map from any artist who hasn't received a Ranked map since their announcement on osu!. (Relevant artists are listed on [the quest page](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=65a3451cf3b11461108e6fa7)!)

### [Speedrank Specialist](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=65a34492f3b11461108e6fa3)

The most difficult part of mapping often isn't even the mapping. Your goal is to create a new map from any Featured Artist and rank it as quickly as possible.

This quest is open for **3 weeks** (until February 6, 2024).

### [From the Grave](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=65a34956f3b11461108e6fc6)

If you're an older mapper, this might be your chance to bring a map to the forefront of osu!.

Your goal is to rank any beatmap that was submitted over 2 years ago!

### [True Cooperation](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=65a3376e48f36f2622ef2f44)

The Mappers' Guild is built on collaboration. With this quest, you and a friend will be proof of that.

Pair up with another mapper to create a spread of at least **5 difficulties**, each of which is half mapped by you and half mapped by that other mapper! For extra clarity, this means there must only be **2 mappers** involved in this mapset — and one is you.

The first 5 maps to be ranked will win. Both mappers per map will receive quest rewards in this case!

### [Above and Beyond](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=65a348b1f3b11461108e6fc2)

It's time to show off your mapping endurance:

Create a map with a song that is **over 1 minute** with **at least 10 difficulties**, or create a map with a song that is **over 5 minutes** with **at least 2 difficulties**.

### [The Hurdle v2](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=65a6e6a3fa448adc05ab6bc5)

As any new mapper can attest, this might be the hardest quest of all.

Create and rank your first beatmap.

Good luck.

## Other changes to the Mappers' Guild

The **Mappers' Guild** is an ever-changing system. In addition to this big batch of quests, we have one major change to publicise:

**Hitsounds can be separately added to Mappers' Guild beatmaps!**

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-01-16-mappers-guild-more-priority-quests/hitsounds.png)

In the past, a map's host almost always created hitsounds, but trends have changed lately. Nowadays, more and more mappers ask other mappers to create hitsounds for their maps, sort of like [guest difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap/Guest_difficulty). 

The Mappers' Guild is following this trend, allowing guest hitsounders to earn the rewards they deserve!
