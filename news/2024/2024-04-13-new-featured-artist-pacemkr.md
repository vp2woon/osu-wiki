**PaceMKR**'s sound has crawled its way into our Featured Artist library!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/414/header.jpg)

More specifically inspired by horror films they watched growing up, **PaceMKR**'s grimey melodies, combined with eardrum-shattering bass, leads to a one-of-a-kind sinister style (which is, of course, now part of [osu!'s library](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists)).

Take hold of **8** tracks, conveniently pre-timed and available as beatmap templates on [**PaceMKR**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/414)!

Experience some of **PaceMKR** for yourself through a scary number of mods in osu!(lazer):

[**PaceMKR**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/414) has more tunes to headbang to (while placing circles).

Another Featured Artist is on pace for being revealed next week — this time with a special osu!taiko touch.

Stay tuned.
