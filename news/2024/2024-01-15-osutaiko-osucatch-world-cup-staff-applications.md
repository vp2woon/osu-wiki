As with every year, we rely heavily on community members for help with many aspects of tournament production. This time, we're mainly looking for mappers and playtesters for the modes listed below.

Mappers will be tasked with creating beatmaps (many times of tailor-made, yet-to-be-released [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals)) based on a specification given by each mode's mappooling team. Mappers will be expected to incorporate feedback from the mappoolers and/or playtesters in an iterative process to refine the map until it is in a shippable state.

Playtesters will be responsible for playing and giving feedback for a plethora of beatmaps (as requested by the mappooling team) to gauge aspects such as difficulty, suitability for a certain slot, and/or skill representativity among others (specific workflows vary for each team). Playtesters are generally expected to have considerable skill on their respective game mode.

Please note that if you are accepted into either team, you will not be eligible to participate as a player in the corresponding tournament.
