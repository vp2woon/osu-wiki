Mappers should be very happy, as this month's changes are mostly focused around the editor! Sit back, grab some tea, and indulge yourself by watching one [pishi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) go over each notable change in detail, or keep reading for the summary:

## Editor changes

- **The timeline toggles controls have been moved.** After community feedback the options have been moved into the `View` dropdown menu, giving more space for the actual timeline.
- **Editing per-node slider hitsounds has been added.** Another small change that aids the current goal to achieve feature parity between the two versions of the game.
- **Breaks are visible in the editor, are automatically generated, and can be manually added or amended.**
- **The positional snap grid spacing, rotation and position can be edited.** Fans of grid mapping can rejoice! This change opens many possibilities for mappers to implement more abstract concepts to their maps directly within the editor.

## Other changes

- **New rank/grade display skinning element.** One small step for osu!(lazer), a giant step for the skinning community.
- **The Traceable mod is now ranked in osu!(lazer).** For now the pp multiplier will be the same as Hidden, but that's bound to change in the future.
- **Judgments are now visible and properly displayed for the Magnetised, Repel and Depth mods.** They were previously hidden while the devs were figuring out how to properly code that in, but they'll now clearly show you how many 50s (meh's) you're dropping.
- **The Constant Speed mod has been added for osu!taiko.** This mod was previously only available in osu!mania, but has now been added to osu!taiko as well after community feedback.
- **The Relax mod has been implemented for osu!taiko.** Staying on topic with osu!taiko, you can now play maps without having to worry about which buttons you are hitting.
- **You can now change the speed modifier for mods with shortcuts.** Press `Ctrl` + `Up` or `Down` to change speed modifiers for the last selected speed mod.
- **Daily challenges are almost ready to be released.** The devs are working hard to set everything up, and we should be seeing them in the next release.
- **Basic support for pass and fail storyboard layers have been added.** This means that the storyboard will change based on the amount of health you have during gameplay (above 50% for passing, below for failing).
