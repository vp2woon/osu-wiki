The pool for the Round of 16 is bigger than the Round of 32 with 3 Hidden and 3 Hard Rock maps, thus automatically providing a bit more variation in those mod brackets.

This week also features the very first [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals) of this CWC. [technoplanet](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/193)'s *Insomnia* was mapped by [autofanboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114) in the low approach rate [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187441#fruits/4624959) pick for this week.

## Round of 16 results

These are the match results from the Round of 16. Compared to the [previous round](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-05-29-osu-catch-world-cup-2024-round-of-32-recap#round-of-32-results), there were more close matches and upsets in terms of seed order, but still many sweeps from the more skilled teams as is to be expected of these earlier rounds.

## Match highlights

### ::{ flag=FR }:: France vs. ::{ flag=CN }:: China

The last time France and China met was only two years ago, in the Quarterfinals of CWC2022. China, qualifying first that year, were able to clear France with relative ease in a 6–1 victory. However, this year the roles are reversed as France has managed to qualify 5 seeds higher than team China.

To start off the weekend, China quickly found a weakness on the Hidden bracket on the French side and were able to win points on both [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187488#fruits/4625050) and [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187441#fruits/4624959). An impressive FC from ::{ flag=CN }:: [Nene Sakura](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701104) on [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187391#fruits/4624826) in between the Hidden map, made it so the Chinese team got a breakpoint and led the match 3–0.

The French team struck back by winning three consecutive points of their own with FCs from ::{ flag=FR }:: [Electr0o](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9484428) on [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187382#fruits/4624812), ::{ flag=FR }:: [Zelepha](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6201167) on [MM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187434#fruits/4624950) and ::{ flag=FR }:: [Holloh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7612994) on [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187388#fruits/4624822). The following two picks were won by each team respectively. With a 4–4 scoreline, team China opted to go for the tech-heavy [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187370#fruits/4624784). However, this was a crucial mistake as team France completely overpowered the Chinese team score and got within one point of winning the match. Their final pick was [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187458#fruits/4624995) and with a double full combo from Zelepha and Holloh, team France guaranteed themselves a spot in the winners' Quarterfinals.

### ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada vs. ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia

Canada and Indonesia are two countries that have had multiple top finishes over the past couple of years, as they often decorate the Finals week with close matches. This year however, they already face off in the round of 16 as Indonesia had a slightly lower qualification in comparison to previous editions. The stakes were high as both teams were eyeing on a spot in the winners' Quarterfinals.

Starting things off, both teams were able to convert their first two picks into points. At a 2–2 scoreline, Canada was able to find a first breakpoint on Indonesia's [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187488#fruits/4625050) pick. Canada was able to win their next [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187385#fruits/4624818) pick on the back of a full combo from ::{ flag=CA }:: [Unlucky_w](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4820793). Indonesia struck back and won their [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187441#fruits/4624959) pick with a 2 1 million scores from ::{ flag=ID }:: [Chroneko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5472877) and ::{ flag=ID }:: [EpanPan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13194580).

Both teams won their next pick as well, so going into map 10 of this match, Canada needed to win their [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187368#osu/4624782) pick to finish off the match whilst Indonesia had to find their first breakpoint of the match to secure themselves a shot to win the match on the tiebreaker. However, Canada confidently won by a margin over 160,000 points with an impressive 980,000 score from ::{ flag=CA }:: [fuhie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7620002). Canada also secures themselves a spot in the winners' Quarterfinals.

### ::{ flag=LV }:: Latvia vs. ::{ flag=NO }:: Norway

Team Latvia managed to qualify for the very first time in their CWC history and were also able to win their very first point versus team Canada last week. As a first-time qualifier, most would consider this a very successful world cup campaign. After dropping down to the loser' bracket, Latvia had their work cut out for them as they faced team Norway. Team Norway is known for being veterans, having competed for many years at a relatively high level. Their captain, ::{ flag=NO }:: [Cameragod](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4974088), is playing in his 10th successive CWC this year, a milestone.

With only 3 people out of 85 voting for team Latvia in the pick'em, many expected this to be a sweep for team Norway. Cue in [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187368#osu/4624782), the second map of the match, and Latvia is able to put themselves on the board after an amazing 1,000+ combo from ::{ flag=LV }:: [AnApple7](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12567935). However, it didn't stop there: on Norway's next pick, [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187370#fruits/4624784), Latvia were able to grab their first breakpoint of the match after another great team performance led by AnApple7. [MM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187434#fruits/4624950) was the next battleground for these two teams, and once again team Latvia reigned supreme and got themselves a third point on the board.

Team Norway, who came into this match as the clear favourites, were looking towards a 2-point deficit against rookies. Cameragod however, in his 10th CWC, led Norway to 4 points in a row with an MVP on [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187388#fruits/4624822) and an SS on [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187441#fruits/4624959). Latvia were able to win [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187381#fruits/4624811) with an impressive double FC, but on their second match point, Norway were able to close out the match 6–4 and knock team Latvia out of the tournament.

### ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan vs. ::{ flag=RU }:: Russian Federation

Japan and the Russian Federation are closing out the weekend and this recap with one of the closest matches of the entire weekend. Japan, seed 8, were facing off their neighbours just one seed below, the Russian Federation. These kinds of matches are the most likely to bring out very close battles and this one was by no means an exception to the rule.

Starting off this match, the Russian Federation won the first map picked by Japan, [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187441#fruits/4624959). Japan then proceeded to take a break point back from the Russian Federation on [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187388#fruits/4624822). Both teams follow this with point wins on their own picks. As their third pick of the match, Japan opted to go for the convert [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187368#osu/4624782) but they weren't prepared for the 2.8 million team score the Russian Federation produced.

It was now vital for Russia to confirm this break point with a map win on their own pick, [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187346#fruits/4624746). Three quarters in, [Kimitakari](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4741164) disconnected from the stream, causing lot of confusion regarding which team actually won the point. After all the dust settled, it was proven Kimitakari's score was high enough to secure Russia the point. They also won [MM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187434#fruits/4624950) to get themselves to match point. Japan, three points down on Russia, had a spirited comeback winning both [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187385#fruits/4624818) and [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187382#fruits/4624812) before the Russian Federation closed out the match 6–4 on [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187391#fruits/4624826). The Russian Federation is now guaranteed a top 12 position and a place in the winners' bracket Quarterfinals.
