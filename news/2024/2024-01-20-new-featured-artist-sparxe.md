Homegrown musician **Sparxe** makes their way from osu!'s leaderboards to osu!'s Featured Artist listing!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/398/header.jpg)

**Sparxe**'s music has been at the forefront of the competitive side of osu!taiko for years. From [the former highest osu!taiko pp score](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/taiko/173764399) to 17 [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals) (most of which were for various tournaments), practically everyone invested in osu!taiko knows **Sparxe**.

**6** of those tunes are at your fingertips (assuming you touch your screen after heading to [**Sparxe**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/398)).
 
**Sparxe** specialises in an interpretive mix of ZUN's *Touhou* themes and Camellia's... Camellia-ness. Hear what that sounds like for yourself through this video of *Zinnober* and the rest of these previews:
