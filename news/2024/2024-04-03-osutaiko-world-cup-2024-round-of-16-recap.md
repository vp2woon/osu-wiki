Nothing happened in the osu!taiko World Cup between the 30th and 31st of March 2024.

In a surprise to no one, the Round of 16 match-ups went as good as any seasoned TWC spectator could have imagined. Not straying from previous years' patterns, the previous week has been full of sweeps, which turned out to be a great week for the lazy [pick'em](https://pickem.hwc.hr/tournaments/140) voters who put down all of their picks as 5–0 — but fear not, as we still have the mappool showcase along with lovely [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals), so let's jump right into that.

## Mappool showcase

The Round of 16 pool aimed to level out the playing field when it comes to difficulty while still putting emphasis on consistency, with teams sometimes taking great risks with overmodding in order to grab the slight edge in their picks. The pool itself features 3 osu! originals, and we recommend you take a second to get familiar with them if you haven't already.

## Match highlights

Usually, we highlight matches that have some kind of back-and-forth, that tell some kind of story, that show the struggle of players fighting tooth and nail. Due to reasons so eloquently noted above, there haven't been any spectacular matches that we can highlight this week for you.

As the bracket slowly moulds into its final form with the usual suspects showcasing their dominance and cementing their place in the upper bracket, it's only a matter of time until the clash of titans begins, and when the true underdogs start to appear.
