**Whispered** proves that even a samurai can become a Featured Artist.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/347/header.jpg)

Finnish symphonic death metal band **Whispered** is held up by two pillars: insane stream-oriented beatmapping potential and a background in Japanese mythology. Ever since 2016, they've been a continuous presence in the Ranked and Loved sections, and as of today, they're part of our Featured Artist catalogue too!

**15** songs have forged a path to [**Whispered**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/347). You're responsible for the beatmaps that follow.

See for yourself what's in store:

If there's one thing that holds you back from mapping, it shouldn't be timing. Every song on [**Whispered**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/347) is available as a pre-timed beatmap template, so you can spam 220 BPM spaced streams without hesitation.

One more artist is planned for this week, and it somehow also sticks to the samurai theme by some definitions. Figure out what this unreasonably ambiguous hint means by checking out the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) this Saturday.

Stay tuned.
