You heard it right, the Beatmap Spotlights are back with its **10th Season**! With how moody autumn days can get, you can fix that by competing on the best beatmapping creations of last months right now!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/beatmap-spotlights.jpg)

After taking a brief pause to address some of the management challenges surrounding Beatmap Spotlights, we'd like to announce that we are back with the **10th season of Beatmap Spotlights**. With Autumn 2023 season commencing, we'd like to thank you for staying with us through the many iterations over the years of playlist-oriented history of Beatmap Spotlights! Even though this season's playlists will remain rather regular, we are preparing some bigger-scheme changes for the next ones, so stay prepared for that!

If you just can't wait to try everything out, **the Beatmap Spotlights lobbies are open for play *NOW* on osu!(lazer)**, so go get involved and start setting scores.

If you still don't have any idea about what this *Beatmap Spotlights* thing could be, just read on below to find out how to jump into the world of playlist-oriented competition now:

## How do I participate in the Beatmap Spotlights?

To participate in the Beatmap Spotlights, go grab yourself the latest version of the osu!(lazer) client from this [download page](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/download).

Once you're done installing and logging into your account, head on over to the `playlists` tab in the `play` section and find the Spotlights lobbies, denoted by a little pink bar. You can also toggle the filter to show only the Spotlights playlists in the top-right corner.

Changing game modes is as simple as clicking one of the four mode icons at the top left of your screen — and it'll be whatever game mode you played last on osu!(lazer) by default.

## Updates

### The end of the gimmick era

After some of successful gimmick season runs, we decided that it's time to move on as they became too limiting or challenging to implement for certain game modes. Rather than forcing new and unimaginative themes, we would like to make a return to the good ol' classic three-playlist format filled with great beatmapping creations testing a wide variety of skills and fitting to all kind of niches.

That being said, we are planning to experiment a little with the shape of Beatmap Spotlights as is, so take this rather as a tactical step back to prepare for a big step forward coming along with the future seasons!

## Beatmap of the Season: Results

As always, we would like to introduce you to the best maps of each game mode according to the spotlights competitors of Spring Season 2023.

The creator of each winning entry will be awarded with **3 months of osu!supporter** for their hard efforts.

A big thanks for each of you that put a hand up to help with selecting those!

### osu!

After a long and fierce battle, osu! ended up with a tie. Therefore, we've got two winners for this particular vote!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-10-23-beatmap-spotlights-season-10-autumn-2023/7380.jpg)

**[Caramell - Caramelldansen (Speedycake Remix) [LESJUH DIFFICULTY]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/7380#osu/43423)**, mapped by [Lesjuh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/44308)\
*primarily suggested by [Zelq](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8953955)*\
*described by [Venix](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5999631)*\
*amazing lyrics provided by courtesy of [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335)*

Did somebody mention the word *nostalgic*? Couldn't go further than this one certain LESJUH DIFFICULTY.

Despite its technically perceived age, Lesjuh's creation aged like fine wine and remains vital, hooking, and a significant achievement both gameplay- and mapping-wise with its timeless flow and rhythm usage, all coalescing into a drowning and challenging experience.

13 years down the line, one couldn't tell it's really *that old* if not for the *eccentric* song choice, taking us straight to a different era. Let's all dance together to the rhythm of Caramelldansen!

*I wonder, are you ready to join us now*\
*Hands in the air we will show you how*\
*Come and try, Lesjuh will be your guide*\
*So come and move your hips sing oh-wa-ah-ah*\
*Look at Spotlights clips do it la la la*\
*You and me can play this classic beat*

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-10-23-beatmap-spotlights-season-10-autumn-2023/29691.jpg)

**[Hatsune Miku - With a Dance Number [0108 style]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/29691#osu/98415)**, mapped by [val0108](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/243917)\
*primarily suggested and described by [Nowaie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5428909)*

This absolute classic may not be the most stellar piece of mapping execution-wise these days but the fun aspects of the map still hit a relatively strong home run after 12 years.

Handling the speed of the guitar solos and Miku spitting some bars may still not be for the faint of heart but val0108's distinct mapping style still manages to make this challenge a fun ride for any player at any skill level. This map is jam-packed with alternating patterns and crazy sliders while being as approachable as possible. So take a stroll down the memory lanes and have some fun, with a dance number.

### osu!taiko

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-10-23-beatmap-spotlights-season-10-autumn-2023/1613520.jpg)

**[Camellia feat. Nanahira - POLKAMANIA (Faputa) [BLACK'S MUZUKASHII]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1613520#taiko/3304046)**, mapped by [BlackBN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6291741)\
*primarily suggested by [[Zeth]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966)*\
*described by [meiqth](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12565402)*

This season, our players decided to nominate BlackBN's simple mapping of *Camellia feat. Nanahira - POLKAMANIA* as their favourite.

When the harder difficulties on this set prove too difficult with their interpretation of the song's complex rhythm, this Muzukashii provides a light at the end of the tunnel by keeping all the song has to offer at a manageable difficulty for our learning players. Finding a solid balance between uncommon rhythm and the players' intuition, this map follows the song's offbeat and varying rhythms in a sense that'll give a fun and unique playing experience to an inexperienced player!

### osu!catch

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-10-23-beatmap-spotlights-season-10-autumn-2023/253969.jpg)

**[Halozy - Genryuu Kaiko [Distorted Scythe]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/253969#fruits/582801)**, mapped by [CLSW](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/531253)\
*primarily suggested and described by [SadEgg](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10278243)*

Truly a spectacle of a map, *Genryuu Kaiko* comes to mind to many as one of the many greats of osu!catch. Whether you're a rookie or a fruit catching veteran, you've probably heard about this map before. 8 years after its original release, this map has become a staple among profiles past and present and for the advancement of catch mapping overall. Whether it be streams, anti-flow, wiggles, or hyper chains, this map has it all without making it seem too out of place. Every section flows as smooth as water dripping off of a distorted scythe.

Boasting the history of catch over its shoulders such as the catch pp record multiple times, CLSW created a fruitful masterpiece that this game mode has come to love and enjoy.

### osu!mania

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-10-23-beatmap-spotlights-season-10-autumn-2023/376340.jpg)

**[Seiryu - Critical Crystal [[4K] Another]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/376340#mania/823920)**, mapped by [Sandalphon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2633753)\
*primarily suggested and described by [Antalf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8793773)*

*Critical Crystal* having won may not come as a surprise for many of you, as this timeless piece is for sure in your folder whether you're a new player or one of the oldies!

This map could be considered the cornerstone of some modern jumpstream maps within the osu!mania community itself. It features intense jumptrills and smooth jumpstreams for a very well rounded experience!

Even after a whopping 8 years of this map being submitted, it's still played and loved by many, seen as a comfort map to return to when the grind becomes exhausting. If you haven't played such an iconic map yet, I encourage you to go ahead and play a piece of osu!mania's history!

## Inside the Spotlights Team

This season was rather a calm one when it comes to amount of the faces swapping around, but we've got some huge qualitative-level changes to announce nonetheless!

[Crumpey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3518705), after long years of involvement in the Beatmap Spotlights as an osu!mania team leader, will be taking an official manager position from now on, helping the project achieve its long-term goals. [meiqth](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12565402) will additionally take over osu!taiko team leadership, replacing [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976) on that position.

We will also be saying farewell to [Axer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7299864), who served as a dedicated and passionate osu!taiko curator for the past 2.5 years. Thank you for your hard efforts!

## The future

What do *you* want to see happen for the next season? What needs to be fixed? What are your opinions on the current system? You can voice out all your opinions in the [osu! community Discord server](https://discord.gg/0Vxo9AsejDkGlk3H) (`#beatmap-spotlights` channel) and we will keep note of every suggestion, so please let us know how you feel about things.

We do hope you enjoyed the Spring Season 2023 Spotlights, and, of course, we do hope that you'll enjoy the Winter Season even more!

See you in the upcoming lobbies!
