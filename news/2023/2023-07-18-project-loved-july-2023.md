A hot summer day is never complete without a refreshing batch of Project Loved!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

To those who are new or unfamiliar with how this works, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to cast your votes! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As always, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the June votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

183 BPM, 2:11 | 2.02★ – 12.16★\
*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

Two years ago the [Theme for Psychopath Justice](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1263883#osu/2895995) took the osu! community by storm, and now in the present, July's *Popular Playcount* will take it again.

Coming from our very own Featured Artist [Kobaryo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/96), this renowned set has 13 difficulties that range from a measly 2.02★ to a monstrous **12.16★**!!! The star rating doesn't lie with the possibly deceiving low BPM of 183, as the 1/4 cross-screen spike will let you know. A leaderboard on a map like this only ages like fine wine, with the skill cap of top players ever increasing. One day, a truly legendary score will be set, so vote yes and help contribute to the legacy it deserves!

*Check check, one two!* This month's *Outstanding Oldies* pick will be [Eagle - S!ck (VIP)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/140945#osu)!

This early-tech rendition of S!ck embodies the title of an *outstanding oldie* by the icons themselves, [RLC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1047883) and [Leader](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/631530). It should be obvious why this map sits perfectly for this category, and personally, I felt like this nomination was inevitable from me. Every object in this map felt just intuitively right, and of course — it's got that 2013–14 magic, baby. Sitting humbly at only 66 favorites, I think that this was a little more of a forgotten classic; but, I do think that this was one of the most defining maps for the year. Believe me or not — just play the map for yourselves!

165 BPM, 3:43 | 7.31★\
*description written by [rHO](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1629553)*

This month's *Small Spectacles* pick will be [olc](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7081160)'s map of *Sheena Ringo*'s [TOKYO](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1813876#osu)!

Previously having cemented his name as one of the best newer mappers with his jazz maps such as [Madiba](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1301789#osu/2700108) and [The Way Up](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1485443#osu/3046041), olc (a.k.a. over_loadcode) is back with another one and boy, did he deliver. Originally mapped for COE 2022's LAN tournament, this alternate map pick is criminally underrated, sitting only at 2K playcount. If I had only a few words to describe this map, it would be... "elegantly aggressive". The difficulty name is *Tension and Release* and the map does embody that well, making you feel like you're constantly building up to something and rewards you for going through all of it, all on top of Sheena Ringo's beautiful and velvety voice.

If the words *jazz*, *over_loadcode*, and *Sheena Ringo* wasn't enough to convince you that this one is a hitter, I don't know what to tell you. Play (or look at) the map. That's an order from me, by the way.

Try your luck with both *Nanahira* and *Koko*'s angelic singing inspiring you to fight against this 9.91★, will you get the pass? Find out now! It may seem an easier challenge than expected, but those 190 BPM streams don't last... Click and clack your way to the 294 BPM slider stream pinnacle! Between the ever-increasing high-BPM streams, the absurdly fast jumps, and difficult tech aim, this map truly isn't for the faint of heart. However! I believe in you, and this pass is yours for the grabbing! Go out there vote yes. Now!

The *Ranked Reject* for this month is [Shira](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5728295)'s set of [Sasaki Sayaka - Atlantico Blue](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/499869#osu).

What an amazing song, *Sasaki Sayaka* never disappoints.

This map has been through a lot of trial and error for the past \~7 years, even with a full spread it has not been pushed enough for rank, so I'm possibly giving it a home here in Project Loved. This mapset has it all, 8 difficulties for all skill levels, featuring GD's from [tatemae](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5223028), [Akitoshi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4754771), [Kwstv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9629457), [small boob](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6023784), [Chihara Minori](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3714249), and the mapset host Shira. This also includes an amazing storyboard made by [Hokichi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/%40hokichi), and keysounds that go along with this masterpiece by Chihara Minori and [Februai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/%40februai), be sure to have them on for the full experience.

This month's *Gameplay Gimmicks* pick will be [Kaifin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596942)'s map of [PUP - See You At Your Funeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/957741#osu)!

You heard that right: more 2B goodness, folks! If you've been paying attention and playing Loved maps from the past, you might be familiar with Kaifin's map of [DVP](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/613989#osu/1295309). Ever since, she's already made [See You At Your Funeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/957741#osu/2005099) serving as a direct sequel, with double the 2Bs. I guarantee you, you'll feel like you were drumming alongside the song, making you mash your keyboard with nothing but pure catharsis. I'd imagine this would be the perfect beatmap to drum and hit your keyboard along to if you're trying to get over someone and letting them go since the song fits perfectly for that — not that I'd know anything about that. Uhm, anyways... PUP, Kaifin, 2B, you'll love this one. Check it out!

With a new diff from [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050) added since the last voting for those of you who prefer hexagons to squares, what more could you want?!

If that wasn't already enough, the map has been featured in a plethora of tournaments as both a precision and reading pick showing truly how diverse this map can be!

If you love this map as much as I do and want to see it in the Loved category, don't forget to vote yes!!

This beatmap has become a hit tournament classic, predominantly on Double Time, appearing in over 50 tournaments and played in at least 1,000 matches. *Nekomata Master* has provided the most gourmet ingredients for Nacrus to cook up this absolute banger of a beatmap. You'll be going in for seconds by the time this 3-minute slapper flies by.

There's jumps, there's streams, there's sliders! All in just a 4.65★ package?! Yes! Do you want a leaderboard for this beatmap to prove you're the Lionel Messi of osu!? Vote yes for this map now!

This mapset includes 3 difficulties, [Akitoshi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4754771)'s *Brand-new Insane* at 5.02★, [SnowNiNo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2506267)'s *Expert* at 5.93★ & AtHeoN's *Brand-new Extra* at 7.53★.\
What made this set most popular is the top diff, so we'll stay more focused on that, but you're welcome to play the lower diffs if you aren't up to par for the top!

This map has been around for a long while now, being one of the most iconic unranked maps in 2016–17. This map features incredibly high-spacing jumps littered with bursts, spaced triples and insane kiai spikes, and don't forget about the spaced stream at the 3-minute mark ! AtHeoN proves many times that he is one of the best "generic" mappers with this one, very well Loved by the community.

This map is overdue in its place in the Loved section. Want to see it finally have a leaderboard? It's up to you!

Space, [II-L](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15223576), and [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334). If those three words are not enough to scare you, I don't know what to say. If you're already familiar with OWC's [SPUTNIK-3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1312076#osu/2719326) (which I'm sure most of you are), hoo boy, you are not ready for this one, and even the mapper himself thinks so.

You might want to buckle up, since the relentless polyrhythms will make you feel like you're in for a space-themed slap in the face. I don't think the map needs further explanation, since I think most of you already have an idea about it, and because how iconic DeviousPanda with his II-L maps are already. The map's a *big bang*, so check it out and blast off!

While reggaeton maps rarely obtain leaderboards in osu!taiko, [PTAZETA || BZRP Music Sessions #45](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1784009) has attained such popularity that it would be a **cri**me not to put it up for Loved! This mapset has various diffs with unique approaches to mapping it such as high BPM, challenging SV, and even a gimmick diff that will keep you engaged while hitting the **cri**sp patterns. Are you ready to take up the challenge of bashing drums to this fast-paced **criminal** flow?

It is always nice to go back to the days when things were just simpler, maybe better. [Yu_Asahina - Gianduja](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1402196#taiko) really is a throwback to the stream meta, as it mainly consist of a high amount of SV changes but with easy-to-follow patterns, mostly 1/4 streams with a few sprinkled finishers that feel super classy to play, making for a pleasant experience to the player.

There are a few exceptions to this rule by nature of being a tournament pick for [TWC 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2021) as a Quarterfinals Free Mod meaning its exceedingly slow, techy parts are also needed in a setup meant to counter HD players just as much as these lightning-fast streams are to counter HR. It can only mean one thing: this is for sure going to be quite a ride both for newer players getting into the Oni/Inner Oni level and more experienced players that are able to use mods in this amazing beatmap. Have fun!

We don't see a map this diverse very often in the taiko mapping scene: [DANGEROOOOUS JUNGLE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1780890#taiko) by [Genjuro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3196091) has a lot to offer, so please, bear with me.

From the intro, we can already tell this is going to be an SV-heavy map, but it doesn't stop there. In classic Genjuro style, this map features lots of convert-inspired mapping techniques like strong finisher usage and overlapping SV!

Not only does the SV overlap, it also serves a purpose as an extreme reading challenge having SVs ranging from 0.30x to almost 6.00x!

Are you ready for this absolute nightmare?

This difficulties are all of high quality and capture the characteristics of the song well! Also, note the intense SV used in the map! This mapset will test your reflexes! 😎😎

Featured in the [Expert Global Taiko Showdown 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2022) Semifinals, this map has since earned its status as a hidden gem worth trying if you are looking to practise your mashing skills.

I think it's time for the 5th and final "you lose" map (thus far) to get a chance like the rest, so head on down to the polls today and seal this map's fate... hopefully as one with a leaderboard! (Hivie in no way forced me to write any of this ;><)

[GiGas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7300747)' *Paradise* mapset has been seen by osu!catch players quite a fair bit in the past 5 years since it was uploaded. For example, the more bouncy and low-BPM style of the map makes it a good candidate for tournaments. On top of that, it's a full set, meaning anyone can truly find their own difficulty and enjoy playing it.

Even if you're a much better player above the skill needed to FC it without any mods, why not try it with HD, HR, DT, or who knows, even FL? It's all up to you!

Come hit the bouncy sliders this map has, and land into paradise!

We don't see it that often anymore, but we have a first-time nominee this month! [Ilhamuharam](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7657968) is bringing you a great introduction to streams and wiggles.

Those patterns can be found in this map. With a higher approach rate of 9.8, they will be a lot more readable for most people. Now, the map doesn't really have any real difficulty spikes and it isn't too short of a map either, making it a great consistency test for all players alike.

Whether you are a newer player just starting to get into the Overdose difficulty range, or a more experienced player trying to play with all kinds of mods turned on, this map will give you a nice little challenge to become the *Little Star* of the leaderboard!

This is the 2nd time we see a [My Angel RangE](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6336713) map nominated for Loved. And yet again, a Camellia feat. Nanahira song, this time *Bassline Yatteru? w*.

What makes this map interesting is that it does not require the player to have a lot of speed or stamina, but rather focuses on having good reading and timing. It contains a lot of snappy patterns which could easily be missed if you mistime them, together with some tricky droplet spawns which make it challenging to SS the map. People that have trouble with the Overdose diff, or are still new to the game, can instead try the Rain diff.

Go ahead and try it, the map is fun!

After introducing *End Time* from CLSW, lets just put it out there that [Tenyo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1636577) is back on the Loved block again.

It's time to pull out those dusty books that your great catch grandpa read when he was a young, astute adult looking just to climb the podium. Now here I am, taking out that same book that hasn't been touched for 8 years and showing you just how much of a beast this really is.

Tenyo, being the creator of a survival-style map of [satori de pon!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/365254#fruits/801716), a co-creator of [Der Wald](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/406881#fruits/884085) (one of the most famous Loved maps in the section) and many other maps which he created during his arc as a mapper, also created this map.

So, let me put it quite simply and straightforward for you. This is *Dash Hopes 3*, one of the older creations from him, which was mostly forgotten about by players seeing as it was ridiculous to FC.

Being uploaded in January 2015, this map contains 300 BPM hyperchains and wiggles, all on top of the fact that it has an HP drain of 5. Quite the challenge for the top players of the 2015th year, hey? Well.

Give this map a chance and see how you can perform against this dusty beast.

[NovaSagittarii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11664177) is one of the few people in the community who not only are quite experienced as a mapper for a plethora of key modes, but also hold an outstanding amount of technical knowledge about SV.

*waitingforyou*, as a Semifinals entry in the [SVSE1](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1313374?n=1) mappool, is not trivial. It features a start-and-stop dynamic, with some pretty gnarly stream bursts spaced with quiet and slow parts that will leave you guessing whether you have to read hard or anticipate hard.

Raise your hand if you miss [Leo137](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1177817)'s JSOF packs. I bet a lot of people do, and even though I can't explicitly see you raising your hands because I'm in front of my computer screen (and it would require me to meet up with all of you), at least I can give you some insight as to why it would be worthy for the next JSOF pack to hit the Loved section!

After writing the first paragraph on this description, I was about to give you some insight that may strike your interest, but I feel like explaining this to you is not doing any justice for how widely known the JSOF packs are to everyone in the VSRG community. Not just the 4K, but also the solo charts (we call them 6K here).

There's plenty of content to go through here, and some of the popular ones, I'd say, are in this pack already for your delight. *Circus-Galop*, *Mission Complete* and even *Angelic Party* are popular scoring benchmarks as of today. Nothing much to say, just straight up joy and happiness can be found here.

So, are your eyes on this pack already? Give them your support if you want to continue seeing more of JSOF packs (and even the Dumpstream of Memes packs as well) in the future!

The best way I can describe maximalist charting that's still faithful towards the music is this chart right here, sitting in front of you. It's not a name that you would recognize immediately, but you definitely know who this person is. [Tadoru Kimi wo Koete](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/863309#mania/1805773) is a taste journey, in many more ways than one.

[Chrubble](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2594280) has been bringing up spicy content that works in tandem with a lot of other Loved picks, but this isn't just straight up popular because of it. The sheer amount of recognition behind this chart is one of the many things that may look to be underrated, because it is. Underappreciated as it may be, you really can't turn a blind eye on this chart since the technicality of it is one of Chrubble's strongest points, and that is something that people can get behind. The fast jumpstreams, chordgluts, and burst transitions are quite unique in a sense that they don't feel overpowered, even though you might want to say it is very overlayered.

It's a mixed bag of both popular (in a player's perspective) and high-quality picks. I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed once you are given the chance to see this chart in this particular wave. Do show your support for this pick if you want to see more of this in the future!

hej.

No, I'm not going on a tirade with you on this, it's just that simple. Today's wave is sort of an experiment on whether quality-based charts still exist in 2023, in terms of pattern construction or its similar principle. And if you [*think abt it*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1395079#mania/4213143), [Vortex-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4999669) has outdone himself on this one.

It's been about couple of years that Vortex- has had a place in the Loved section, hasn't it? And when you *think abt it* (I mean Vortex-'s charts), it's always about congruent structure, specific pattern flows, and cute attention to details. This one is an excellently made dump chart that has surpassed mappers' expectations, and it remains to be a work of art as of today. Not to mention, the song helps as part of the popular internet culture of a [certain anime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/339/Serial_Experiments_Lain) that makes it palatable to general ambient consumers. I'm sure this community has seen it all.

Now, if you ask me whether this chart should have a place in Loved in comparison to other picks in this wave, you bet I will say yes! And as always, there are fun little rates to hype yourself up for more challenges. If you *think abt it* enough, make sure to support this pick with your "yes" vote!

Long notes.

Don't you love long notes? And long notes that go very fast? Today's special, *NUCLEAR-STAR*, is one such file. [\[Crz\]Crysarlene](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5492871) has been a continuous contributor and veteran to the scene, with previous notable Loved entries.

Do you remember the days when players who reached the [last level of \_underjoy's LN dans](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1116467#mania/2332319) could be counted on one or two hands? As I am writing this description, I can't remember where to actually find the current amount of people who cleared Yume, so I'm probably just gonna make stuff up on the spot. Let's say this amount exceeds the amount of fingers on my two hands, shall we? That sounds about correct; people have gotten mad good at the game, right?

Ahem. Needless to say, *NUCLEAR-STAR* is one of the maps featured in the last course of \_underjoy's LN dans: Yume. And, since a number of people can actually be competitive on this map today, we are providing a leaderboard for you to enjoy!

If you are enthusiastic about this prospect, please vote in the thread!

[yak_won - Wind Tales](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1114801#mania) by [soulseason](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8369893)\

Welcome [soulseason](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8369893) to the Loved voting! We present his chart of yak_won's chart of *Wind Tales*.

*Wind Tales* is an easy-going chart designed for practice at an intermediate level. It is very straightforward to play, so we anticipate people setting very high scores on this if they are able to play this for accuracy.

This is easier than our typical 7K rice pick for Loved. We don't want to leave out the intermediate players who may be starting to feel a lack of 7K charts for their level in the Ranked section.

If you want to see more charts of this type and difficulty, make sure to give soulseason your vote.

[Mrs. GREEN APPLE - Ao To Natsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1510465#mania) by [emO_Oticon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12064488)\

[emO_Oticon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12064488) returns to the Loved nominations with a multi-key set of *Ao To Natsu*!

The 4K chart, *Our Blue Has Begun*, is mostly a simple LN density pick. The LN complexity for the 4K difficulty is not too high, so this is pretty approachable for people who want to learn how to play LNs.

The 7K chart, *Our Summer Isn't Over*, takes it up a few notches. It is patterned in a way that makes it very difficult to not LN break if you don't have the coordination to keep your fingers pressed down (especially in the middle column). It is rather easy to maintain good accuracy on, but it is surprisingly difficult to combo.

The \[PHNM edit\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [-NoName-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10400730)*

While [yellEx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8195584) may be new to appearing in Loved news posts, he is certainly not new to charting whatsoever. It is about time he gets a spot in the Loved vote. The last 7K LN nomination for this month is yellEx's chart of nowisee's *confusion*!

This is a higher-level LN chart designed with a mix of O2Jam and osu!mania charting styles. There is a mix of O2Jam-style brackets with other LN patterns more commonly found in typical 7K LN osu!mania charts. Most prominent is the way you need to play notes in between LN brackets, which demands a high degree of finger independence at this density.

A version of this chart was used in the Grand Finals round of the [2022 edition of osu!mania 7K Philippines Nationals](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1560227?n=1). The reception to this chart was quite good.

yellEx is long overdue for a Loved nomination. Now is your chance to vote for *confusion* and see it moved to the Loved category!
