**Ashrount** pounds through the doors into our Featured Artist library.

You're more familiar with **Ashrount** than you may think. While their newest productions are under the alias **Ashrount**, they also produced [Emptiness](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1210804) under the name *Xect.* for BOFU2017, and a heap of older songs under the moniker *Maverick*, like the multi-mode marathon set [Shironaga Star Jet -aquamarine mix-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1012634).

Regardless of how you may know **Ashrount**, it's clear that their songs are in a league of their own.

Pick your favourite from the **10** listed on [**Ashrount**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/352) whenever you're ready to begin your mapping journey!

## Featured Artist release schedule update

**We're returning to *one artist announcement* per week.**

We've been releasing new Featured Artists **twice per week** since September 2020, amounting to over **8,500 licensed songs** since the start of the Featured Artist program!

With this massive library (which we'd like to remind people is very possibly *the* biggest collection of licensed rhythm gaming music on the planet), the Featured Artist program has already met and gone far beyond its initial goal of providing osu! mappers with a wide variety of songs to choose from.

That library will continue to grow of course, but going forward we'll be taking on the approach of **involving the broader osu! community as much as possible in Featured Artist releases**. The past two and a half years have been fantastic for getting the ball rolling, and we now want to focus on helping people engage with our vast array of super talented artists, both old and new. If we're honest, releasing two amazing artists a week can get a bit overwhelming for people who want to really get involved, and cutting things back helps us figure out ways to make this happen.

*Experimentation* is how we're going to start this all off, particularly by pairing new releases with similarly new and exciting projects and events, such as beatmapping contests, streams and more.

So to really get things started, next week's Featured Artist announcement will also have an accompanying livestream on the [osulive Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) where [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) (a.k.a. the dude writing this) creates a beatmap from start to finish using the new artist's music. If you make a map too, it'll be reviewed on the stream as well!

...and that's all for now! To hear about what we'll be doing for releases *after that*, stay tuned. :)
