As the [osu!mania World Cup 7K 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_7K) approaches its climax, take a moment to explore some of the **5** brand-new songs created specifically for the tournament!

But first, some context.

Our Featured Artist program has expanded over the years, and we've only recently started dipping our feet into the depths of *original tournament track commissions* (also known under the [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals) label). You might've seen a few osu! originals already via Featured Artist announcements over the years, or perhaps from the recent [Twin Trials contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-02-01-twin-trials-contest-beatmapping-phase).

Thanks largely to [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718) and each game mode's world cup staff, you may have noticed a bunch of osu! originals in our official tournaments too!

In case you missed any of the new songs, this article highlights every osu! original showcased in [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_7K)!

### Toromaru - Uncharted Sky

This high-tempo jazzy tune by [**Toromaru**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/279) isn't what you'd expect from a rhythm game, but it's exactly what you need. This acted as a *Rice* pick in the [Semifinals map pool](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_7K#semifinals.1).

Play the [7-star map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1931471) for yourself, created by [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737) and [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750)!

### LV.4 feat. Yuu Ikeba - Sentimental Surge

If you know anything about [**LV.4**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/214)'s sound, you know exactly how awesome this song is.

[This beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1935688) created by [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750) was another *Rice* pick for the [Finals map pool](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_7K#finals)!

### Hino Isuka vs. s-don - Glooorious!!

[**Hino Isuka**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/272) worked alongside **s-don** to design this \[glorious pun\] song used as a *Hybrid* pick in the [Finals map pool](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_7K#finals).

Try [its beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1935691) created (yet again) by [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750)!

### SAMString - Ataraxia

osu! player turned musician [**SAMString**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/273) has given back to osu! through this stellar electro tune used as a *Long Note* pick in the [Grand Finals map pool](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_7K#grand-finals).

Check out [the 9-star beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1939418) created by [Remuring](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6522146) and [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737)!

### katagiri - Kyuukou

The [Grand Finals tiebreaker](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_7K#grand-finals) is a coveted position for any beatmap, and this masterpiece by [**katagiri**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/176) has the slot secured.

If you can somehow play a [10.76-star beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1939261), give this collab by [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750), [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737), [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092), [Remuring](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6522146) and [MapleSyrup-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1192936) a go.

Look forward to hearing this song in a potential tiebreaker this weekend on [osu!'s Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive)!
