Choose one: a fulfilling and longlasting life, or the world-shattering sounds of **Hitori Tori**.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/395/header.jpg)

Here on osu!, **Hitori Tori**'s claim to fame goes hand in hand with another artist: *yambabom*, who remixed **Hitori Tori**'s tune *perthed again*, ultimately leading to [this legendary mapset](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/268693).

That's only one song of course — even more of **Hitori Tori**'s talent shines through their solo works, each of which we're proud to finally have in our Featured Artist collection!

**6** songs are ripe for the picking from [**Hitori Tori**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/395), including that classic *perthed again* remix and another collaboration with renowned breakcore-ist [goreshit](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/57)!

We never skimp on an opportunity to showcase a classic. Relive some memories through the video below, or make some new ones by exploring the rest of the previews:
