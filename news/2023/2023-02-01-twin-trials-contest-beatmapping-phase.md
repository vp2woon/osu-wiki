How do you define a *classic beatmap*?

Back in the day, [*Kuba Oms - My Love*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/163112) was bundled with every new installation of osu!. It was an experience shared by a whole generation of circle clickers, turning it into **an undoubted classic**.

In 2019, *My Love* was retired. [Hide and Seek](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/972932), [Reaction](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/994104), and [Birdsong](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/972810) took its place, amassing tens of millions of plays from new players along the way. All of these beatmaps feature one artist: [James Landino](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/39), the musician responsible for **a modern generation of classic beatmaps**.

---

[**Twin Trials**](/wiki/Contests/Twin_Trials_Contest) is here to usher a new creation into the realm of classics.

Your task: find a partner and design a full difficulty spread (Easy/Normal/Hard/Insane/Expert) for any of the [**5 new custom-made songs**](#songs) by [James Landino](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/39).

The winning beatmap (from the game mode with the highest submission count) will be used as the base for the **storyboarding phase.** If the winning beatmapping duo and storyboarding duo agree to it, their creations will be combined and **bundled with new installations of osu!(lazer).**

Let's break everything down.

## Schedule

This contest is split into **two phases**: *beatmapping* and *storyboarding*.

## Prizes

The beatmapping phase of this contest is essentially four simultaneously running contests — one per game mode. That said, each mode has its own set of prizes!

### Mapping judge panel

| Placing | Prize(s) |
| :-: | :-- |
| ![Gold crown](/wiki/shared/crown-gold.png "1st place") | 6 months of osu!supporter, [*Elite Mapper* contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points), *Mappers' Pick* profile badge |
| ![Silver crown](/wiki/shared/crown-silver.png "2nd place") | 4 months of osu!supporter, [*Elite Mapper* contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) |
| ![Bronze crown](/wiki/shared/crown-bronze.png "3rd place") | 2 months of osu!supporter, [*Elite Mapper* contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) |

As mentioned earlier, the winning beatmap (from the game mode with the highest submission count) will be used as the base for the **storyboarding phase**. If the winning mappers and storyboarders agree to combine their creations, their collaboration will be **bundled with new installations of osu!(lazer)**.

### Community Vote

Top beatmaps will be published for a **community vote** and featured in **5 lazer playlists per mode** (one per difficulty level). At this time, teams may reveal their beatmaps to the public.

To participate in the community vote for each game mode, you will need to play through any of the relevant playlists on lazer. This ensures anyone voting has actually considered all of the options!

| Placing | Prize(s) |
| :-: | :-- |
| ![Gold crown](/wiki/shared/crown-gold.png "1st place") | 4 months of osu!supporter, *Community Pick* profile badge |
| ![Silver crown](/wiki/shared/crown-silver.png "2nd place") | 2 months of osu!supporter |

Once the playlists are closed, whoever has the highest score on each leaderboard for each game mode will receive a minor prize too:

- **Easy/Normal/Hard/Insane playlist leaders:** 1 month of osu!supporter each
- **Expert playlist leader:** 1 month of osu!supporter + *Twin Trials Champion* profile badge
