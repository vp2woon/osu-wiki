Don't know what lazer is? Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut_SOreClcc)! In short: it's the new osu! client, where the devs have been putting in all the marbles lately to bring you new features and improvements.

### Changes

Here's what's new in this update:

- **New mod "Synesthesia".** This is beat snap colouring for the osu! game mode as a mod, just like osu!mania already had but as a setting... That'll probably get sorted out later, but whether it actually makes rhythms easier to read is the big question.
- **Search bar in the mod select screen.** There will only be more mods in the future — more than the screen can fit.
- **Lower threshold for stacking objects during placement in the editor.** In other words, you can place circles closer to each other without osu! thinking that you wanted to stack them.
- **Visible beat snap grid in the osu!catch editor.** Copied from osu!mania.
- **Editor setting to lock distance snap placements to the current point in time.** This makes distance snap behave like stable, something 99.999% of mappers are used to.
- **Song select performance improvements.** The client handled beatmap background previews and some other things inefficiently. Now it doesn't.
- **A bunch of cosmetic changes.** osu!taiko's hit receptor now flashes either red or blue instead of white, osu!mania's lane colours have been adjusted, all the bar lines now render behind the notes, etc.

Armed with such information, there's only one thing to do. Go download the latest update (or [osu!(lazer) itself](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/download), if you haven't already) and check the [changelog](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog/lazer/2023.621.0) for all the changes in way too much detail, including the tiniest stuff.

osu!(lazer) update videos like the one you see above can be found on the [osu! YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@osugame), but did you know that these videos are also viewable right in the [changelog on the website](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog/lazer/2023.621.0)? (That's a recent addition, like from 2 days ago.)
