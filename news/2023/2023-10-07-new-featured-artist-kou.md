osu!'s Featured Artist catalogue has been missing one thing until now: **Kou!**

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/383/header.jpg)

Composing with a self-proclaimed "undefined" style, **Kou!**'s works combine more genres and subgenres than any sane person can reasonably identify — high-speed dubstep, J-core, hitech, chiptune, oriental, uptempo, hardcore, speedcore... we'll stop the list there.

These songs are unlike anything you've heard before, and **6** of them are up for grabs from [**Kou!**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/383)!

Need a sample of **Kou!**'s musical dexterity? (Hint: the correct answer is *yes*.) Take a peek at [Accolibed](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9269034) as he tries an 8-star map live at [COE](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event/2023)!
