As always, every song above and a bunch more can be found on [**Minstrel**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/349). If you've ever considered mapping the 6th rendition of *Yotogibanashi no Kamikakushi*, now's the time.

If you'd rather map a song from our next Featured Artist instead, keep watch over the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for another release this Saturday!

Stay tuned.
