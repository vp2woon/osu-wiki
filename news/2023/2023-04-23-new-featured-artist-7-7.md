Anarchy enters our Featured Artist library through top-tier osu!taiko player **7\_7**'s chaotic sound.

Before even touching music production, [**7\_7**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7491106) was one of us.

Peaking at **global rank #5** in osu!taiko, **7\_7** has encountered and endless slew of insane songs through his drum bashing journey, leading him to produce a highly specific style of music that's perfect for rhythm games: *ultra-dense breakcore tracks with intensity that no other songs dare to match.*

**25** of those songs are ready for mapping from [**7\_7**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/356), including the [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals) *7\_7 feat. kasane vavzed - 7D* that debuted in the Grand Finals pool of [TWC 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2023) (which happened a few minutes ago, by the way).

If you're struggling to map something by **7\_7** (or any of our other Featured Artists), check out the `#featured-artists` channel in the [osu! Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ppy).

If all you need is some inspiration though, check out [the map from TWC in the video below](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1980743#taiko/4113017), along with the rest of these previews:
