Art aficionados of the osu! community rejoice, for our amazingly talented assembly of artists have once again conjured forth a veritable smorgasbord of seasonal surprises. However, with only so much room in our proverbial stomachs (also known as the main menu), we're now left with the Herculean task of trying to pick only so few from so very, very many.

To aid in our digestion of this dangerous conundrum, the distinguished Mr. Fat joins us once again in conjunction with [*you*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/389) (the Featured Artist) to create the video equivalent of an appetiser below:

The voting will be open for just **7 days** from the date of this post, so make sure you get in the door quickly, lest you find out all the cutlery is gone. We just simply couldn't let someone vote without a spoon, after all.

As usual, a selection of the top-voted entries will make it onto the main menu as our Winter 2023 seasonal backgrounds, and all these esteemed finalists will receive 3 months of osu!supporter for their efforts. The top 3 entries nab a little extra gift in the form of a bespoke profile badge cropped directly from their own winning piece — neat!

Big thanks to everyone who was brave enough to tackle the theme and submit an entry — you're what make this contest tick at the end of the day, and the art enjoyers of the osu! community very much appreciate your efforts.

For now, the rest of us must now consider our choices in this most wonderful agony...
