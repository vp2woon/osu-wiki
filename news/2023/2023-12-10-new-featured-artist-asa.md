**Asa** has subtlely reached into every corner of osu! throughout the last decade, and at long last, they're part of our Featured Artists!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/394/header.jpg)

In collaboration with [KOAN Sound](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/49), **Asa** released *Sanctuary*, a 5-track EP with circle clicking classics like [Starlite](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/294496) and [Tetsuo's Redemption](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/617995). In a similar vein, **Asa** and KOAN Sound also co-produced *Movember*, another EP with contributions from a vast spread of their creative peers, including tracks like [Beyond The Shadows](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/583372) and [Cascade](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1464050). 

All **9** songs from both of those EPs are officially part of [**Asa**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/394), pre-timed for you to splash your circles (or drums (or fruits (or piano keys))) onto.

You thought it was over, but [COE](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event/2023) is clearly still kicking, as evidenced by this multi-keyboard play of *Starlite* by resident mapper [Okoratu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405) from the venue. Check that out, along with some of the most varied tech maps on the market:

Given KOAN Sound's involvement in these tunes, we've included pre-timed beatmap templates on both [**Asa**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/394) *and* [KOAN Sound's Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/49). Feel free to download the base for your next map from either place — there's no difference.

...Anyway, that'll do for this week's Featured Artists! In case you missed it, we highlighted **20** osu! originals in the [OWC recap news article](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-12-10-osu-world-cup-2023-concludes#osu!-originals), so give that a peek when you're ready, and stay tuned for another artist reveal next weekend!
