Swap out your pen nibs and prepare your eyeballs — it's time for 2023's first art contest!

Our much-beloved art contests are back again for 2023, and we're starting things off with one of the themes of all time. So much of a theme in fact, that it might just be the most creative one yet: the *Journey into a Beatmap World Art Contest*!

Ahem, anyway, the theme is simple, if you haven't figured it out yet:

**Draw any of the official or community osu! mascots inside a beatmap!**

Yes, you heard it right. Isekai and Tron aficionados alike rejoice, for you now have an actual reason to shove your favourite mascot inside a rendition of your most beloved beatmap.

The possibilities are almost limitless, but we'll give you some hints to help get things rolling:

- A mascot engaged in freedom diving
- Who's afraid of the Big Black rollercoaster
- Riding the Blue Zenith aurora
- Stealing the Cold Green Eyes lady's parasol
- Sitting by the foggy trees from Gold
- Fleeing in terror from the ghost sliders of Solace of Oblivion
- ...and basically anything else you can think of that you can clearly relate to a beatmap!

Backgrounds, deathstreams, sliders, spinners, storyboards, — anything that you can artistically wield to make it obviously relate to any particularly famous or iconic beatmap is fair game. Hell, it doesn't even have to be a super famous set, just make sure that anyone who's played the map before will recognise it, and you're good!

Think about what the mascots might be doing in this beatmap — are they escaping from the cursors of doom? Are they chilling in an especially recognisable spot? Are they interacting with the other denizens that live in this beatmap world?

As before, you'll have **27 days** from now to mull over your creation, so you've got plenty of time to make it all work. The top three finalists will receive a custom profile badge of their winning work (as is tradition), and every finalist will receive 3 months of osu!supporter.

Naturally, this is a very broad and exciting theme, and we're very curious to see where people go with it... but not before we're sure they've read the rules below:

## Rules

- **By submitting your artwork to this contest, you grant us permission to use your artwork in the main menu client should it win, and to use it in promotional material for both the game (osu!) and the contest (Journey into a Beatmap World Art Contest).** You retain all rights to your creation and you can sell it and distribute it however you like — it is your work, after all. We're just saying here that if you submit your piece to this contest, you should be okay with us using it.
- **All entries MUST follow the contest theme ("mascots inside a beatmap") and contain AT LEAST one of the osu! official or community mascots.** Double-check and make sure your piece can be related back to at least one Ranked or Loved beatmap and be prepared to justify this if you're asked by the contest organisers!
- **All entries MUST be suitable for all-ages viewing.** We're not entirely sure how people could get weird with this particular theme, but we also know that where there's a will, there's a way. So just don't. Graphic depictions of Truck-kun will be upgraded to garbage truck-kun (and thrown into the disqualified bin) instead.
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK. REDRAWING AND COMPOSITE WORKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** Plagiarism sucks. Don't do it. Someone in the comments will call you out for it as has happened every other time someone's tried and they're going to do more damage to your reputation than us removing your entry from the voting will do. Use only your own work — brushes and the like are fine, but that's it! Don't redraw someone else's work.
- **AI art generation methods are not allowed.** This includes any kind of software that has you supply a written or visual prompt and fills in large amounts of details for you. We also acknowledge that this stuff is everywhere now and we have *science* employed to help detect it.
- **Artist attribution (names, social media handles, etc.) must be limited to no more than three lines total and confined to either the bottom left or bottom right corners of your entry.** Being proud of your work is good, just do it in a reasonably small spot of your work. One thing unique to osu!'s history is that we really don't like forced advertisement, and attribution that is too large can come across like it.
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece — namely 2732x1536.** But no worries, the contest system won't actually let you mess this up anymore! Progress!
- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed on the main menu and during the voting process.** Very simply: anything in the big white circle won't be seen during the voting. Don't leave a big white hole in your piece either, please!
- **Do not leave the dotted osu! cookie template visible in your submission.** The osu! cookie template is not featured in any known beatmaps and it should also not be featured in your works. That's just how the cookie crumbles.
- **Treat copyrighted characters from other intellectual properties with respect, and use them sparingly in your work.** Remember that every character, mascots included, are someone else's treasured creation, so please wield them with the same love and adoration you'd give your own OCs and work. Egregious or otherwise excessive use of other copyrighted characters (to the point where they're very much the main focus over our mascots) may disqualify your entry.

Once you've nestled all that into your noggin, head on over to the [Journey into a Beatmap World Art Contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/175) to submit your entry!

Until then, the rest of us are just going to have to wait to behold the forthcoming majesty.
