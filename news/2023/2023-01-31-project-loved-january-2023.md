Missed us? Come get a taste of this fresh batch of Loved picks made just for you!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

To those who're new to what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As always, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the December votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

Before we proceed, here's some updates straight from Project Loved HQ:

- We'd like to give a warm welcome back to [Kasumi-sama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263)! They have decided to wear the osu!catch captain's hat again in order to bring you the (not so) freshest beatmaps to your favourite section!
- Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, as we have to bid farewell to [UberFazz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8646059) and [Roxy-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11931563) from the team, they have decided to move on. We'd like to thank them for their dedication as osu! and osu!taiko captains respectively o7.

That should be all in terms of updates for this month. Don't forget if you're interested in participating in Project Loved discussions of a certain game mode, or have any questions, that you can reach out in one of the Project Loved Discord servers listed below:

[Various Artists - Square Jump Practice Maps](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/112651#osu) by [Jemmmmy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1921587)\
149 – 200 BPM, 3:43 | 5.18★ – 7.63★\
*description written by [Skill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7802027)*

Have you been around osu! long enough? If so, you'll remember how the Square Jump Legends were made on this beatmap.

Here I start the new years with a bang and bring to you [Jemmmmy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1921587)'s very iconic *Square Jump Practice Maps*. At an outstanding near 3 million plays and 1.8K favorites, there is no doubt that this is one of the most *loved* maps in the entire game. This is one of those maps that feel as if everyone has it sitting in their graveyard of collections — just waiting to be resurfaced. As for the mapset, the title is pretty self-explanatory, but believe it or not this map is *not* entirely squares, because there's some spice to the mix in each difficulty. This map features multiple difficulties with different skill ranges, featuring 4 songs in 1 set.

In rising difficulty, the set starts with B0UNC3's *Distorted Reality* at **5.18\***, Getter Jaani's *Rockefeller Street (Nightcore Mix)* at **6.03\***, Hommarju feat. Latte's *masterpiece* at **7.06\***, and last but not least t+pazolite's *cheatreal* at **7.63\***. Each song has AR9 and AR10 difficulties for those who prefer the lower/higher AR side of things.

If this map passes voting, it's time to show everyone how good you are at geometry!

[Nanahoshi Kangengakudan feat. Matsushita - Dance Number o Tomo ni](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1682758#osu) by [apoq](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4349246)\
296 BPM, 4:20 | 9.65★\
*description written by [Skill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7802027)*

More [apoq](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4349246) maps for Project Loved voting? Yes.

apoq's attempt at *Nanahoshi Kangengakudan feat. Matsushita - Dance Number o Tomo ni* is a crazy one. This alt-style aim map is no joke, at a massive **9.65\*** this really pushes the boundaries of aim as a skill. If the corner-to-corner full-screen jumps don't scream unrelenting to you, maybe those jumps being at a whopping 296 BPM will. apoq always finds a way to structure these maps in such a fun to play way, making for truly one of the best aim mappers that, in my opinion, osu! has ever seen.

A lot of popularity was gained on this map from [WhiteCat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101)'s incredible ["GODMODE" run from June 25th, 2022](https://youtu.be/PNmi50whDbA). Since then it's made its way through the community, even being featured as one of the last maps in the [osu! 16 Player Aim Battle Royale](https://twitter.com/osuallstars/status/1561790519797325831), where it had even more eyes on it.

Do you think this should be Loved? Vote now!

[Machine Girl - Infinite Potentiality (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1719598#osu) by [rnuxk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10643960)\
147 BPM, 4:08 | 7.06★\
*description written by [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334)*

This pick features a map by an up and coming mapper that absolutely deserves the recognition this map has gotten.

[rnuxk's map of *Machine Girl - Infinite Potentiality*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1719598#osu/3514241) is a perfect blend of a catchy song and an extremely fun alt map. When I found this map, I was honestly blown away by how well it represented such a cool and complex song, so I hope that anyone discovering this map for the first time catches the same feeling.

Make sure to give this map a try!!!

[goreshit - xenobeat](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1306568#osu) by [fergas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3144542)\
237 BPM, 2:29 | 7.35★\
*description written by [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334)*

This next map has become something of a stamina staple among the playerbase after being created for OWC 2020.

Sitting at 237 BPM, [fergas' map of *goreshit - xenobeat*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1306568#osu/2708952) keeps the pressure on throughout its deceptively short 2:30 length, clocking in at a staggering 1.8K combo. For such a short song, this map serves as a perfect benchmark to test your stamina and speed skills.

If you like stamina tests then be sure to give this a try, and cast your vote on whether this should be Loved!

*description written by [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)*

For the month of January, both of my picks will involve beatmaps that have been at the top of the Loved website for years, but were never chosen due to some resistance on whether we should or not pick "mapsets that could go for Ranked". As we want to make Loved closer to the community as we go along (and you'll see some news about that rather soon), these maps stood out to me as long-awaited by people to be given a chance in the Loved voting. With that being said...

*chase (TV Size)*, mapped by [Shiguma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4404784) in September 2017, might make you think at first that this is just popular because of *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*. However, as soon as you start playing the map, you're welcomed by a very distinctive style, full of fullscreen jumps that don't feel overdone, and a structure that feels reminiscent of [Milan-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1052994)'s high-star beatmaps of the time. Thoroughly enjoyable over its seven difficulties, it can be appreciated by players of all skill levels, especially considering there are lower difficulties mapped by quality mappers such as [yaspo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4945926), [Cheri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5226970) and [frogyfro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7010859). Give it a try and tell us with your vote whether you want this map to have a leaderboard!

[Kairiki bear feat. GUMI, Kagamine Rin - Inai Inai Isonshou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/932530#osu) by [Lavi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3399877)\
294 BPM, 3:39 | 2.44★, 3.95★, 4.71★, 4.74★, 5.91★\
*description written by [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)*

For this second pick of mine, I chose a map that honestly blew my mind when I saw it on the Loved website listing. If you know all the other VOCALOID songs with extremely high BPM and alternator-like patterns that have been around in osu! for over ten years by now, then you know what to expect here. Lots of patterns that require finger control, linear aim, and fast snapping are what await you in this extremely fun and popular beatmap.

*Inai Inai Isonshou*, mapped by [Lavi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3399877), is a great take on the style previously mentioned. With its balance of chaotic patterns and well-designed visual patterns, it takes the player on every direction the song goes, creating quite the unique experience. Again, for this map you'll have a wide range of difficulties to try out, including an extremely fun Insane difficulty mapped by [Chaos](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2628870). Again, if you feel like this map deserves a spot in the Loved section, make sure to give it a try and tell us what you think!

246 BPM, 4:36 | 6.84★, 6.98★\
*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

Nearly 2 years ago, I found this map and by accident saved it as a bookmark on my profile. For 2 years, I have been using this map as a landing page to navigate the website from, and more than anybody I believe in its chance for Project Loved.

*ennb* is one of my favourite maps in the game. The patterning and music are impeccable, combining to make create a magical flow state while playing that rivals the best of maps. A dance between yourself and the map, whether that be along the vocal's intensity or the guitar riffs, nothing about this map can be overstated.

Please check this map out.

[Pendulum - Propane Nightmares](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/755844#osu) by [nhlx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3827077)\
174 BPM, 5:10 | 6.83★\
*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

[nhlx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3827077) does it again, bringing a high-slider-velocity map to an amazing Pendulum song. Don't let the star rating of 6.8\* deceive you, as hitting slider ends is a difficulty of its own, ignoring keeping combo up. These 5 minutes of fast long sliders are masterfully made, with the entire map packed with indescribably fun patterns. If you find yourself on osu!(lazer), I'd recommend trying this map with uprates for a challenge.

I hope you enjoy it!

[Playboi Carti - Fell In Luv (feat. Bryson Tiller)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/841693#osu) by [-Tochi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3664366)\
163 – 240 BPM, 2:15 | 1.36★ – 4.62★\
*description written by [rHO](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1629553)*

Let's face it — osu! needs more hip-hop. Thankfully, [-Tochi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3664366) is here to bring one of the modern classics, that is Playboi Carti's *Fell in Luv (feat. Bryson Tiller)*.

I feel like this mapset is kind of a hidden gem for newer players, hence the big number of play counts. With multiple difficulties and the hardest one just being shy of 3.5 stars, -Tochi successfully mapped this banger of a **LUV**ed song that's not only accessible, but is immensely fun for all players. I'd personally give this my own badge of Certified Bangers, so check it out!

[Marmalade butcher - Floccinaucinihilipilification](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1331748#osu) by [melloe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2367616) and [Marr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6751036)\
200 BPM, 3:35 | 8.37★\
*description written by [rHO](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1629553)*

If anyone can represent and show you what it feels like to be a rockstar using just circles, sliders, and the osu! playfield alone, I'd bet on [melloe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2367616) and [Marr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6751036), specifically their collaboration on [Floccinaucinihilipilification](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1331748#osu/2759110).

Yup, it's another "yummy guitar riffs" map nomination from me. If you liked [Smile of the End](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/775541), the map I nominated last November, you will absolutely like this one too! Sitting humbly at 8 stars (yes, don't take the 8-star marker lightly, folks!) — filled with unforgiving stacked streams and even more, melloe and Marr absolutely went nuts in this map. It's aggressive, daring, and beautiful in the most chaotic and best way possible. I don't think enough words can tell what's really the deal with this map, so I suggest that you check it out on your own and rock out to it.

Starting off this new year's taiko picks with a bang, featuring [\[Zeth\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966)'s gimmicky and aesthetically pleasing *NULCTRL*. Not only does this map include some amazing SVs, it also makes use of extremely creative barlines and kiai flashes which go very well with the song.

Even though this map isn't very hard mechanically, I believe many players should experience this original and innovative map. So what are you waiting for, are you ready to play this satisfying map to please your eyes? 👀

*description written by [Roxy-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11931563)*

Japanese mapper [nananass](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7231722) made a map with the [Katagiri](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/176) song that everyone loves!! At 320 BPM, it's fast and difficult, but the mainly 1/4 patterns make this map a great exercise for players practicing high BPM. Also, even for players who are not confident in their skills should play and practice with the goal of passing the map. It will surely be good practice and you will hopefully see improvement. I urge you to play it yourself!

In this issue, I will introduce a song by [katagiri](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/176). osu!taiko has several katagiri maps, but I would like to introduce *katagiri - AMEN KATAGIRI GENERATION* created by [Gamelan4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9856910)! This map is also popular because it was used as HD2 for the qualifying round of [Expert Global Taiko Showdown 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2021#qualifiers).

Being a breakcore song, the notes are very well matched and it is a fun map to play. Would you like to try your hand at this map? I think this map should be Loved!

Along with this cute and catchy anime song, 24 diffs are made by various mappers. Even with the sheer amount of difficulties, each map has its own character and has been enjoyed by many since 2017. *a e i u e o ao!!*, the opening song from the *Hinako Note* anime, already features plenty of enjoyable rhythmical variations, yet here they are expressed in 24 different styles. The beatmap has a wide difficulty range from the lowest 4.15\* to the highest 8.76\*. If you haven't already, try looking for the one that fits your taste!

*description written by [Kasumi-sama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263)*

For this month of January, I've decided to come back to Loved with one hell of a throwback from osu!catch, with this *perthed again* map by [Minato Yukina](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4133477), having been used as a Finals pick all the way back in [CWC 2016](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2016#finals)!

Even if it's not too intimidating for today's top players' standards, as a low 6-star, it's definitely challenging to say the least.\
The first half reels you in, with fairly nice and classic patterning, to then hook you in right at the ending, with some extremely mean jumps.\
This map is by Minato Yukina's usual standards extremely well mapped, and I can guarantee you that there is no way you're not enjoying yourself playing this.

If that's the case for you, then time to go ahead and give this map a Yes vote!

[Fayew](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12498861) stole all the Machinegun Psystyle in the world... **We can't get any more Machinegun Psystyle.**

But please let me off the hook boss! I truly believe that the world can be at peace with *We Could Get More Machinegun Psystyle* being introduced into the loved section. It is truly mapped wonderfully, with few gimmicks but with very few inconsistencies as well. I do think high-end players will enjoy playing the map. Next to that, it is not often we see psystyle into the loved section, given that fayew stole all of it. We haven't seen ANY since CIC 2021, where this map was used as a tiebreaker! So, shall we let it slide...?

If you do want to let it slide boss, do take the map for a spin and vote yes, I will wait for your judgment.

(I hope you enjoyed being a Jerry-rigged osu! mafia boss throughout this roleplay now hush go check out the map for real!)

For this month, we have a nice little spread by [Nosuri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2150415) et. al., ranging from a Cup difficulty all the way up to a Deluge: at least one difficulty for every type of player to enjoy!

Now, because almost every difficulty is mapped by a different mapper, you can see everyone's personal twist on how the difficulties are put together. Whether you are playing Kielzu or Joakh's Overdose (and the same goes for Nosuri's and Secre's Deluge), you're never really playing the same thing over again, so there's definitely quite a bit of variety between the difficulties.

Give the mapset a go, enjoy the variety of difficulties, and cast your vote!

This month, we got a special type of map for you. One that does not play like most of the other maps out there, and it is mapped by none other than [Emiru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3306180), who is well known in the community for mapping a lot of notorious and challenging maps.

Extremely challenging is what probably describes this map the best. Not because you need an insane amount of stamina, nor the fastest finger speed, but instead, it requires pixel-precise movements almost throughout the whole map. Most of the map has very difficult edge dashes that are just barely not hyperdashes. Most players won't even be able to come close to passing this map, and if you lose your timing just once, it could already be the end of the run as it is really tricky to get back into it.

This is a high-end map catered towards high-skilled players with fine-tuned catcher control and it will surely bring them to their limits.

Many people have heard about [Jole](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2883132) from their numerous stream maps, many of which have been featured in major tournaments. This is not one of them.

*Weeble Wobble* is Jole's first personal and experimental mapping approach to SVs, and while the concepts are fairly simple in mapping execution, it provides a really solid and challenging reading challenge. This is a map that will make you question at which scroll speed you should tackle it, and as an SV player myself, I don't actually have any foolproof advice in that regard.

Combining both extreme slowjams and mild fastjams, *Weeble Wobble* requires a lot of training to get right. It literally weebles and wobbles. Don't get discouraged if you can't get it right from the get-go: this is definitely not an easy one.

I hope you have been enjoying the content that we have been promoting — let's make 2023 an even better year for SVs!

Haha, I bet you didn't see this one coming up for this wave, did you? Now rev up your gigachad energy ladies and gentlemen, because we got a true delight of a high-difficulty dump file from the returning figure of your resident Brazilian notecharter, [Guilhermeziat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3661387), introducing *Can You Feel My Heart*!

It's hard to describe this chart without fully understanding the premise of dumps, and Guilhermeziat has taken it to a whole new level with representing different intensities of the pattern usages in several different occasions. Let me say this right now — this chart does have its core elements bang on, and the choruses especially are expressed really well with pinpoint dump utilisation, so it does not feel uneventful at all. It wasn't long after it gained traction from being used in two different tournaments, such as [SOFT3](/wiki/Tournaments/SOFT/3) and [Speed of Light 2: Lucha Libre Edition](/wiki/Tournaments/SOL/2020), and funnily enough, this was also featured in [Lemon's Fruit Snacks 1](https://etternaonline.com/pack/56662), the prequel of the pack that I have already mentioned about [Adcar](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/911470#mania/1902611) from the last Loved wave. Guess there's no doubt in saying that the pack definitely features a lot of good stuff inside, and this entry also does not disappoint.

With the added rates for your own true personal challenge, it surely does affect your gigachad moments, and the role model behind it will definitely inspire you to some degree (definitely in a good way!), so why don't you vote Yes to give out your support for this entry? Don't miss out on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity before the voting phase ends! Come on, quick quick quick quick quick!

Hi, may I have another chordjack map of a Skan's song? Sure! From the first CJ pick of 2023, [Xingyue](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9614083) will continue to bring you some murderous jacks!

Maybe this isn't the first time you've heard of [Xingyue](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9614083), since he already had a map loved a year ago, [Kitsune no yomeiri](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1624095). As a "rice" mapper who has been active for no less than five years, his maps have been widely circulated among the osu! community and have really helped many people practice and improve.

Just like this map, *Hustler*, which was inducted in [Compulsive Chordjack Collection 2](https://etternaonline.com/pack/99938) in 2021, currently one of the most influential CJ pack series in *Etterna*. I guess there is not much else to say about chordjack maps except to watch your wrists and do not ruin them.

At the beginning of 2023, don't you want more fierce music and jack maps in the future? Just vote for it!

*description written by [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063)*

\[Crz\]hinako1804's Complexes packs shouldn't be new to anyone by now, each iteration offering a well-crafted collection of charts that cater to a specific theme or pattern. We'd want to welcome to the Malody group of mappers who are now on the Loved spotlight!

The name of the pack should be self explanatory. There's something for everyone! It goes from mid-level jumpstream difficulties up to more challenging charts as the star rating increases. My personal favourite? Can't go wrong with [Kake Nukeru Anime Song Medley VII](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1595301#mania/3258311)! If you enjoy consistency challenges and actual marathons, you might take a liking to this one. See how far you can go without screwing up.

Other than that, we'd like to thank hinako for arranging these packs. The community has seem to grow fond of them. And while we cannot nominate every single pack at the same time, we'd like to know what the rest of the community thinks of these once leaderboards go up. Enjoy!

And we have yet another newcomer in Project Loved! Quite a few ones this month around. Auraah's first nomination is none other than *Indomitable Spirit*. A run-of-the-mill long note chart that has garnered the attention of quite a good chunk of players! Props to said players actually practising LN picks before jumping into tournaments. We all know what happens when that's not the case...

Players should expect this to be quite a fair, entry-level chart into LN density maps. Quite easy honestly, but definitely requires practice for those who aren't all that used to the pattern yet. Expect the choruses to be the densest parts with arguably the trickiest releases here and there. The rest of the chart will prove a consistency and accuracy test for everyone to enjoy.

We want to know the reception this pick will have. While some of its popularity came from its appearance on certain unnamable courses, a good chunk of it came from being able to stand on its own as a decent long note chart to get your hands on. Have fun setting a good score in DT!

Despite our recent nominations of speed-based charts, the Loved section (and osu!mania leaderboards in general) is still lacking in the speed department for 7K. With that said, we introduce [MapleSyrup-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1192936) to the voting stage with his chart of *Swim in the sea of quarks*!

Used in the Semifinals stage of [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_7K), this chart can be difficult to obtain a good accuracy score on. However, because the patterns are relatively straightforward, it is also appropriate for a wide range of skill levels. This is significantly more approachable than a [previous 7K speed nomination](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/756792), so more people will be able to enjoy this.

MapleSyrup- is long overdue for a Loved nomination, so we hope you support *Swim in the sea of quarks* in the voting stage. After all, osu!mania needs more speed charts.

[paulkappa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7115625) has been around making 7K charts for some time now, and it is time for a shot at the Loved voting stage.

*MOON*, specifically the Slave of Sadness difficulty, was used as the LN Density pick for the round of 16 in [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_7K). It is quite easy and most 7K mains reading this can play this. If you need something a little harder, try the Search for Happiness difficulty instead. Don't let the shields catch you off guard here.

You may have noticed that we have begun to nominate many charts from those used in last year's 7K MWC. This will continue to be a trend as many of the charts managed to retain popularity long after the tournament concluded. However, we will still be balancing MWC picks with other charts too, so don't worry about this — our aim is for a wide variety of picks.

This is paulkappa's first Loved nomination. He deserves a chance at getting a Loved chart, and now is the time to make that happen. Make sure to cast your vote for *MOON*!

Are you ready for more LN coordination and control? [9eater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6556530), a newcomer to the Loved voting, is here to deliver with their chart of *Taiyou to Himawari*!

In a similar vein to [another recently Loved LN coordination chart](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/867748), 9eater's *Taiyou to Himawari* is a slow, LN-heavy chart designed to test finger coordination and overall control. This skillset is rarely practiced and often underappreciated in comparison to other 7K skillsets, but this chart has quite a high play count for this skillset due to the lower difficulty overall. Whether you are just getting into learning 7K LNs, or you want to push accuracy (or in my case, not missing) on these kinds of charts, *Taiyou to Himawari* is suitable for you.

We are always glad to introduce people who deserve a spotlight to Loved, and 9eater is no exception. If you want to see more LN coordination charts in Loved, don't forget to vote for *Taiyou to Himawari*.
