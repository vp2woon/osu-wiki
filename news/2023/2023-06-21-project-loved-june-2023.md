Vibe through the start of summer by voting on some fire Loved picks and collecting our all-new medals! üèñÔ∏è

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

To those who're somehow still unfamiliar with what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As always, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the May votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

So, let's get into June's pi‚Äî

Oh, hold on a moment, a certain [swole seagull](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335) has informed me that we forgot to mention one more thing, which is the release of **Project Loved medals**!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-06-21-project-loved-june-2023/medals.png)

Play through the beatmap packs that are present in the Project Loved section of the [beatmap packs page](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=loved), and earn yourself a total of **6** shiny new medals created by our talented designer [Tanza3D](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10379965). Each pack consists of a curated selection of beatmaps that were added to Loved in a given season, and depending on how well these medals are received by the public, we may continue releasing them on a seasonal schedule, so don't forget to leave any feedback in the comments below!

In other news, [huu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6044237) has returned to the Project Loved team after a well-earned break! He will be assisting with keeping our monthly workflow running and occasionally hosting some Loved rounds. *Remember, you're here forever*.

With that out of the way, let's get into June's picks (for real):

The Popular Playcount for this month is [Tatan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5646529)'s map of [El Alfa "El Jefe" x CJ x El Cherry Scom - La Mama de la Mama](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1491754#osu).

You might have seen this map around somewhere, whether it be in a multiplayer lobby, Twitch, TikTok or YouTube, and for a good reason too, because Tatan does an amazing job making this an addictive map just like the song. This map features a 260 BPM raw aim that tests your geometry with near full-screen squares and repeating back-and-forth patterns, all at a whopping 8.92\* ‚Äî it's no small feat.

I would love to see a leaderboard on this, and I hope you would too. Leave it your honest vote.

*description written by [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)*

For this month's Outstanding Oldies pick, I would like to tell a story from a far, far away past.

Back in the *old, old* days of osu!, people, even top players, would join multiplayer lobbies for fun and play with others. The competitive scene was mostly unheard of and we were still happily farming score instead of pp. Yet, there was no shortage of extreme beatmaps in these lobbies, because what could be more fun than slapping a nearly 7\* beatmap on a multi match when most people couldn't even play Insane difficulties?

[Welcome to my Fuckin' Flower Garden!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/21863#osu), mapped by [nollarg](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290058) in 2010, is basically the [Galaxy Collapse](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/396221) of its time. It's not the pinnacle of mapping technical expertise, but it is a hell of a fun challenge to try and pass. I mean, I'm sure a lot of people could FC it nowadays, but don't get too confident with that star rating ‚Äî the high HP drain, coupled with low overall difficulty and a multitude of spaced streams, is sure to make your passing experience, at the very least, slightly frustrating. But isn't that the fun in old maps?

If you want to see people competing for cool scores on a leaderboard for this beatmap, make sure to vote yes!

[fanzhen0019](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/418699) is here to present to you this month's Small Spectacles pick with [Camellia - HINODE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/651710#osu/1382030)! I'm sure the one and only rhythm game giant and osu! Featured Artist [Camellia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31) doesn't need an introduction to you all.

In classic fanzhen fashion, this masterfully made map sits at a bit of a deceitful 7.37\* and is littered with tricky rhythms and unrelenting aim control patterns ‚Äî don't let those 1/6 bursts trip you up! That said, even *HINODE* manages to be on the tamer side of fanzhen's creations.

Be sure to give your vote if you want to see this in Loved, as this one is going to give you a run for your money.

Brace yourselves for yet another [Asphyxia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1715720) and [Axarious](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2614511) collaboration, a Daredevil Difficulty pick featuring [DJ SHARPNEL - Marunouchi surviver](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1349505#osu)!

Immerse yourself in this near 5-minute banger from the legendary DJ SHARPNEL, accompanied by Asphyxia and Axarious, pushing you to your limits and testing your skills on streams, aim, finger control and stamina. With cut streams, cross-screen sliders, and varying flow aim, this map is ready to pack a punch and more.

At a staggering 8.46 star rating, this won't be an easy challenge to survive. Vote if you'd like to see what the greatest players are capable of!

The Ranked Reject for this month is [apoq](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4349246)'s map of [yanaginagi - Outside](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1368755#osu).

As always, apoq delivers with the song choice and mapping. Unfortunately, this map was not able to enter the Ranked section for being *just* 134 ms too short. We have found it a home here in Project Loved, though. This map is one of the tamer maps you'd see from apoq, at 6.84\* and 190 BPM it's a pleasant experience. Littered with jumps, bursts, and streams, it's what most would call a "generic" map.

Pay attention to this month's Math Messages ‚Äî I mean Meme Monstrosities... Today, we're learning about triangles!

[-N a n a k o-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1407516) has brought us [RHS - SAS, SSS, ASA, AAS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/445835#osu/975374) to teach the troubled youth basic geometric principles, and after seeing the apparent inverse relation of playtime to math grades among many osu! players, I think this is an important piece of media that we can all appreciate.

But that's not all! -N a n a k o- has accounted for this generation's shorter attention span and increasing need of content, and has also included remixes, such as Ievan Polkka, Metal, and J-core versions. This wide range of genres is further accompanied by the wider range of difficulties, spanning from 3.80\* to 7.66\*, with additional contributions from [\[ Drop \]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2391299) and [MinG3012](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1583218). Sharpen your reflexes, embrace the synergy of music and mathematics, and let their expertise guide you through the fascinating realm of Euclidean geometry!

Brace yourself for a captivating journey that will not only test your skills but also ignite your passion for the wonders of geometry.

This rather unique and atmospheric song features a top difficulty of 6.47\* and a whole set of guest difficulties down to 2.46\*, making this accessible to everybody. With each difficulty giving its own interpretation of the song utilising a wide range of rhythm choices, fancy sliders, and neat patterns, maybe you'll be as entranced as me looking at this map.

If you look through the majority of osu!taiko maps with leaderboards, you start to see a trend! Speed maps, tricky patterns, or everyone's favourite TV Size anime maps. This month in Project Loved, I want to go in a different direction with [WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1171259) hosted by [JarvisGaming](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8601048).

This is a marathon spread of Billie Eilish's first studio album, featuring every song included mapped in unique ways. From captivating SV to enticing patterns, each track is an experience meant to be savoured. Included are separate difficulties so you can pick your favourite or opt for the marathon, which combines this mapset into a 42-minute masterpiece, which despite the low BPM will struggle to bore you.

I hope you have the opportunity to play this work of art and vote for it today!

It has been a long time since we have last seen the popular rhythm game song [furioso melodia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1811904#taiko) in taiko. But fear not, the talented mapper and player [Skull Kid](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3044264) is here to deliver.

This 2017 VIP version offers a more aggressive rendition of the song, making it perfect for a speed, tech and finisher challenge map. Skull Kid's WRATH difficulty features all of this, making it a great candidate for Project Loved!

This month I present the [7_7 - 7_7 Appreciation Mapset](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1401944#taiko), a [X a v y](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3738344) mapset with 7_7's unique songs mapped on it.

What a surprise! In order to have it loved this time, 7_7 has created an exclusive song for this event and a version of Meriba that has not been released at [TWC 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2023)! (The diffs in this mapset are the diffs used in TWC 2023 before nerfing, and the SR is a whopping 9.31...??????????)

This mapset contains 20 diffs mainly for advanced players from SR 6.52 to 9.31. All of them are very top notch and you will be drawn to the world of the song as you play along a mapping style that matches the exciting tune of 7_7!

Can you pass all the maps? Take the challenge now!

Just go ahead and give this map a try. It certainly does not bite... right?

We are back again with the June picks, this time with a new guest to the potential "Loved" scene.

[Nidoking](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7034422) is one of the more "underground" mappers of the scene, and isn't talked about much. However, he has made some incredible maps for people with specific likings to maps without any hyperdashes and this map says it all. [Beatdrop - Phase 1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1202004#fruits) is a pretty *special* map as the difficulty name says, and a great challenge at that. Don't let the semi-low star rating trip you up and get your hopes up. This could be the challenge you're searching for as well as a great skillset to develop.

What's your say on letting this unique challenge have a leaderboard?

[ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) has introduced many different mapping styles and niches throughout his many Loved maps, and this time he introduces his 1986 mapping style.

In *Yeti* we have a good mix of old style‚Äìspecific and convert patterns shown through the mix of very low AR, strange spacings and massive sliders that force all kinds of crazy movement. This is especially shown in the top diff of the set, "yeti", which gives a ton of super harsh spacings, full-screen sliders, difficult stacks, and to top it off, an AR of 7.2! This will make playing the map with any mods very difficult and is a great experience for players wanting to improve their low AR ability.

You know those mappers who we all agree on are actually very decent, but somehow never really seem to make the spotlight, right? If you do, then it is most likely that you would also agree that [Seija](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6443263) is one of those mappers! Here, Seija makes their second entrance to the Loved section with another beatmap that you truly cannot hate. To start off, [Kamah](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1173438#fruits) is an absolute fire song. I can say with certainty that there is not a single soul that doesn't enjoy it.

Then, the beatmap is quite conventional, although a little challenging, yet definitely still playable by most of the three-digit playerbase; it's fun to play and not a drag in the slightest, despite its semi-marathon length. It has some good kiais with fun streams and jumps, which makes it feel very flowy. Combining these two makes for a good time, and I truly believe that is all that needs to be said about this map! As ever, it was a Seija map that sort of slipped under the radar, and I think it is deserving of a spotlight.

If that description wasn't satisfactory I will give you a riddle: what do you call a smiling man holding a scythe? A grin reaper! I hope you were as *exscythed* to hear that joke as I was, ha! Now go and play the map you doofus.

Either way, this decade-old map from [eldnl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/285756), namely, *Rare Respite* is perfect for you! Featuring both a Cup difficulty and an easier Rain, this map is great for both beginners and returning players alike.

You might also recognize this map from [CWC 2016](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2016), where it was picked as a Double Time map in the Quarterfinals! This map is jam-packed with a bunch of history throughout the course of catch history. Make sure to give it a try, even if you are a more experienced player, as it is one of the oldest catch-specific maps!

A 24-DIFFICULTY MAPSET .  .  .  .  .  .

Enjuxx is already known to be feared when it comes to the difficulty that he can create to absolutely shred any player's hands with muscle cramps and mental pain. This new mapset created by [Enjuxx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10727985), [BoberOfDarkness](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3427748), [Dahcreeper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6926006), [Stats-Kun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8611935), [Trent](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3438241), and [Xinnoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4236057) has a wide plethora of difficulties ranging from 1.13\* to 13.98\*, as well as specific skill tests, mainly being one of speed, obviously.

Enjuxx's previous map, [Sendan Life (katagiri Bootleg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1431102#fruits/3881697) created by the artist *Remo Prototype (CV: Hanamori Yumiri)* was already an incredible difficulty spike and we've seen some amazing scores coming from Netamaru and Motion, two skilled players known for their speed and raw skill in all the realm!

The question is, do we open the floodgates that is a leaderboard for this mapset and bring out the ETERNAL PAIN to the playerbase? Up to you.

[Yumeno Himiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1806962) is coming back to the Loved section once again after two years now, this time with a very, VERY, different map from his last two Loved sets, which had either streams hard to read, or the weirdest low-AR wiggles known to man.

Here though, we get a pretty classic jump map, 4 minutes of pure 6\* fun, and a very well-mapped one at that. This pick is an effort so that the lower 3- and 4-digit players can get a bit more variety to play in this section, so we hope you appreciate it!

[dionzz99](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2545604) is an old-school name. *Very* old-school. Their oldest mapset dates all the way back to 2013 ‚Äî can you believe 2013 was ten years ago? Anyways, I definitely wasn't around long enough to witness nor confirm this, but dionzz99 seemed to be one of the few pioneers of scrolling variation, slider velocity gimmicks on osu!mania, also affectionately known as "SV". *Tenkai Rising* is unequivocally their most infamous creation.

Do you remember [ecafree2's map of *Bizzare Nation*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/906808#mania/1892295)? The gimmicks here are pretty similar, albeit the difficulties themselves are more physically demanding. Remember: there's no issue with your monitor, it's the map itself that works that way! You can feel free to enjoy the "Tenkai" difficulties without SV, or you can dive into what makes this beatmap really infamous: the "Tachyon" difficulties. The "Rising" and "Madness" sets of difficulties also provide you with different kinds of physical and patterning challenges.

Do you feel like traveling back to 2017 yet? Feel free to cast your vote in the thread!

Listen man, I don't think we as Loved team captains are looking prepared enough to introduce this pick to everyone, and especially just by looking at this mapset's link alone should tell you how dark those difficulty icons are. But on the opposite side of the spectrum, people are crazy enough to do this chart even at normal rate... that scares us quite a bit. Today, we present to you yet another chordjack pick that is, as expected, one of the hardest chordjack marathons that has ever been made, and it is [G e n g a o z o -Noize of Nocent-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1979161#mania/4130350) by [ade_maine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14814632).

Look, I'm not going to beat around the bush telling you why this is very popular (even though the upload date is fairly newer), but that's because it is ‚Äî it was uploaded by [someone else](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13799949) and then... the original mapper came by and gladly uploaded this mapset by themselves. I'm sure some of you are pretty skeptical about it, but you can look it up on this chart's [link](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1753144#mania/3747680) before this was uploaded by the original mapper.

I'm sure most of us already know what to expect in this chart (I'm already telling you in the first paragraph, excuse me), so I believe we don't need to further elaborate you on what's inside this chart. You can see it for yourself, and make sure to do your hands a favor by warming them up before you attempt to tackle this chart from start to finish. We are not responsible for any complaints about any injuries you may have, so you've been warned!

As ominously fitting as the background is, this mapset prepared you with a set of downrates to make sure you get the full experience if you can't finish the normal rate. But that would take longer for you to finish, so take your pick. With that said, if you are a very strong supporter of crazy dense chordjack marathons, do show your support and maybe you will see another one of these in the upcoming waves!

Oh boy. I don't think we've warned you about this Loved wave being heavily stacked during June 2023, so we're kind of sorry about that... (but also not sorry), so I guess we are going to make sure you have a week of breather to warm up your muscles quite a bit. This time, we are entering an insane territory of super dense charting from [11Bit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14804526), which is [STRONG 280](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1393858#mania/2877294) by [katagiri](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/176)!

This chart really does not need any further introductions of what to expect in terms of patterning here. Strong 280 BPM handstreams, sometimes even broken up into chordgluts that are insanely dense. As if it wasn't enough already, this chart doesn't let you miss a beat with heavy hand-quadjacks in the middle section. You get a breather after that insanity, but later on it will go up from zero to a hundred almost instantly.

It really does garner a lot of attention from the players and mappers alike (mostly the players, because they are simply looking for challenges that breed excellence in due course), so I believe this would be a fantastic addition to the Loved catalogue, if it does get in. For other players who aren't simply up to how insane this chart is, don't fret, this mapset has downrates for you to build up those muscles.

Are you feeling strong enough to tackle this massive gauntlet? If you are, then you will have to vote yes for this mapset! Stretch those muscles up!

With many Loved entries to their name, it's time to finally add one of their most iconic maps of all time: *Salamandra no Odoriko*.

Back in the day (think around 2018‚Äì2020), this was definitely a mind bender. With incredibly demanding coordination, reading, stamina, and release control, *Salamandra no Odoriko* is, even to this day, not a simple cookie to bite. As such, this was often picked and considered in late stages of many tournaments. Even with the incredible progress that the LN tournament scene has gone through in terms of difficulty, *Salamandra no Odoriko* still stands as one of the classics that players will come back and train on.

Ska (/sk…ëÀê/; Jamaican: \[skj√¶\]) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. It combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. Ska is characterized by melodic and catchy instrumentals and wholesome vocals, which puts the genre as one I like to vibe to, even though I honestly haven't dived deep at all into it. Oh yeah, [Ska](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10313023) is also an incredibly influential tech dump mapper across multiple mania scenes.

Soooo, [Matusa Bomber](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1505962#mania) doesn't exactly belong to the ska genre. However, it does have some summer festive vibes, if not a little bit too hardcore for the common taste. Ska (the mapper), being iconic and revered for their mastery of flow and patterning as they are, translates *Matusa Bomber* into an incredibly intense, physical and technical boss chart that is begging to be played by top players who are looking for a challenge. With rates up to 1.1, leaderboards will truly surface the ones who have done their due training.

There are no pipe bombs in the voting thread ‚Äî feel free to cast your vote!

You are probably wondering and would ask the Loved captains: "Hey, most of the 4K picks are very hard in this wave..... can't we get an easier pick this time, please?" It is true that we aren't lying about this month's wave being stacked, but hey, we have a slightly easier pick for you this time. Introducing [Violent Arcade](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1245864#mania/2589660) mapped by [Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811)!

The thing about this chart is that this was a small nod to the [*Flash Flash Revolution*'s chart](https://www.flashflashrevolution.com/levelstats.php?level=2614) when this was being used in the [MWC 4K 2020](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2020_4K) Finals. You can see how they are quite similar in terms of the chart's construction, and it demands a solid finesse to grasp what's going on in this chart with broken-up jumpstreams and long notes littered into smaller synths and melodies. Sometimes, it gets into full-blown fast LN semi-inverse, transitioning in and out into the nitty-gritty bursts.

This pick, while being popular, was quite a pivotal moment during a MWC Finals match with [Brazil against Japan in guaranteeing a top 2 on the podium](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive/v/739608962?sr=a&t=4610s), and you should watch that! Aside from that, with the uprates being added to test your limits in adapting a barrage of different patterns, this was a treat to tournament players and even the casual players involved. So, are you up for this easier pick in this wave? Don't forget to cast your "yes" vote!

[Holo Bass & Spikey Wikey - 300 Nuts Per Minute](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1353659#mania) by [arcwinolivirus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2039089)\

For this month's popularity pick, we present to you a large 4K and 7K spread of [300 Nuts Per Minute](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1353659#mania), made by [arcwinolivirus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2039089).

This set is representative of an older, more simplistic style of Ranked charting that draws quite a large audience because of said simplicity. A 6-digit play count in osu!mania's Graveyard is indicative of said popularity. In addition, this set of *300 Nuts Per Minute* covers a wide range of skill levels.

With that said, while this set is as straightforward as it gets, be mindful of the 300 BPM. Make sure you're ready to handle this speed. Some of the bursts, especially on the top 7K difficulty, can be rather abrasive at 300 BPM.

People have requested more very-high-popularity picks for nomination, so hopefully this pick does not disappoint. Make sure to give arcwinolivirus your support if you want to see this in the Loved category!

[pporse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4991434) has not had a Loved pick since 2019, and he is back with his set of [OVER DRIVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/239964#mania)!

This is a 7K legacy pick with an initial upload date going all the way back to 2014. This is typically what a set looked like back in the day. Despite many charts from around 2014 being infamous (or a guilty pleasure for some people) for having ridiculous SVs and awkward patterning, *OVER DRIVE* is simply a generic hybrid with simple chordstream and LN patterns in each difficulty. You will find the patterns very pleasant.

Also, give both the *Trails* and the *Ys* series a shot while you're around. Some of you out there are huge fans of those games, and I know you'll be glad to see this pick here.

If you want to see more legacy picks like this in the Loved category, don't forget to vote for *OVER DRIVE*.

The \[Gott ist tot (ETT Edit)\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [-NoName-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10400730)*

Our very own [Remuring](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6522146) returns to the Loved voting with his chart of Tsukino's [God-ish](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1596941#mania/3524338)!

This chart was used in the [7K Extraterrestrial Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1506203?n=1). It is a highly technical LN pick focused on bursts, minijacks, and other awkward patterns. It isn't very dense though, so if you have enough technical skill to handle these patterns, it is actually pretty easy.

Also, with the many covers of *God-ish* out there, we hope that Tsukino's version will be favored by many while playing.

There aren't many 7K LN picks like this in the Loved category, so if you want to see this and more charts like this in the Loved section, make sure to give Remuring your support.
