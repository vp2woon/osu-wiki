Another resident of the osu! community joins the ranks. Welcome **Krimek** to our Featured Artists!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/371/header.jpg)

Avid osu! mapper, former player, and tournament/contest host **Krimek** has expanded their osu!-related repertoire of skills even further by producing their own twist on tons of electronic subgenres. From breakcore to hardcore to techno and to drum 'n' bass, **Krimek**'s sound covers anything an osu! player could be looking for, inspired heavily by major producers in the rhythm game scene like *Supire*, *Taishi*, and our very own [*Camellia*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31).

**16** songs make up [**Krimek**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/371), including every tune from **Krimek**'s debut album *GALAXY OF MIND/MINE*!

If you're debating whether or not to map one of these tracks, gain some inspiration from [ChillierPear](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9501251) warming up to an intense tournament while vibing to one of **Krimek**'s many chill and soothing soundscapes:

## Featured Artist playlists

[At the start of last month](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-06-03-new-featured-artist-andora#featured-artist-playlists), we launched a batch of [**Featured Artist playlists** in osu!(lazer)](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-06-03-new-featured-artist-andora#featured-artist-playlists) for osu! and osu!mania. Now it's time to showcase the prize-winners!

For those out of the loop, playlist leaders earn prizes based on [this cumulative leaderboard](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists#cumulative-leaderboard). More specifically, anyone with 10 total points earns their own shiny profile badge!

### Cumulative leaderboard updates

Scoring algorithms in osu!(lazer) were adjusted while this playlist was ongoing, so scores set using the previous algorithms have been reprocessed to match the current scoring formulas. In some cases, users couldn't improve their scores because plays set with the previous algorithms generally resulted in higher scores.

Because of this, we've decided to reward users based on their **highest placement** in the playlist *before* reprocessing or the playlist *after* reprocessing.
