**Down** is living proof that the osu! editor is just a stepping stone towards becoming a music producer.

...as if [VINXIS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/22), [tieff](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/34), [happy30](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/27767), [Kurokotei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/398275), and [Nakagawa-Kanon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/242) weren't enough proof already.

**Down** is a beatmapper-turned-musician whose first steps into music production came from the [A Labour of Love](/wiki/Contests/A_Labour_of_Love_Contest) beatmapping contest, where he designed a *questionable* remix for the classic [Kuba Oms - My Love](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/163112). Since then, he's branched out into every genre known to man, taking influence from different composers and designing primarily *Touhou* arrangements in all sorts of styles.

[**Down**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/350) has **13** songs for you to experiment with, more than half of which are named after mappers.

You probably know **Down** from his beatmap [Ekoro](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1683876) (yes, that's the name of the song). This tune blatantly showcases **Down**'s love for rhythmic complexity in a way that only a mapper could imagine. See what we mean through this play set by [Ekoro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/284905) (we're talking about the player this time!), then try out any of these other maps:

Start mapping any song above (and more) from [**Down**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/350)! If your name is something like [UberFazz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8646059), [Halfslashed](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4598899), [Lince Cosmico](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6070370), or [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334), the Ranked section is waiting for your debut.

It's the weekend, which means there's two more Featured Artists to look forward to next week! Glue your eyes to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for more details and we'll see you again very very very soon.
