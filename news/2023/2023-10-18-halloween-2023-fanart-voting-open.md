As always, Halloween remains the most devilishly attractive art contest theme of the year. However, this popularity comes with a *grave* cost... namely the torment inflicted upon all of those who must choose so few out of so many amazing pieces!

The venerable Mr. Fat has risen from the earth to conjure forth an especially ghostly preview video to provide a quick rundown on what's what. How is it ghostly, you ask? The osu! cookie is partly transparent. Yes, we're very creative. Team Grimoire and [siromaru](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/226) are doing the heavy lifting with their piece *Glasya-Labolas*, so make sure to give it a watch (and maybe crank your volume up if you're in the mood for the *danse macabre*):

[**Click here to start voting in the Halloween 2023 Fanart Contest!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/186)

The vote will be up for just about **7 days** from the date of this post, so get in quickly, or forever hold your peace!

A selection from the top-voted entries will be enshrined eternally as our Halloween 2023 seasonal backgrounds, and their creators will nab a neat little dollop of osu! supporter to the tune of 3 months for their artistic acclaim.

The top 3 voted entries will also earn their authors a bespoke profile badge sampled directly from their own creation, prompting visitors from across the globe to point and go *"damn, they made it"*.

A big thank you to everyone who took the brave step of putting their work forward in the first place! Lots of creative costumes and settings this year, truly a real treat for the contest followers among us.

For the moment however, we march towards our doom... a hellish wasteland where only *20* votes await us...
