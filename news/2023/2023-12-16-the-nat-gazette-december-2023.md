Time is a flat circle. The QAT Gazette returns with a new look and goals! Get updated with the latest changes being deployed on the Ranked ecosystem.

It's been a while since the last issue of this series of posts! So much so it had its name slightly modified. For those unfamiliar with the [Quality Assurance Team Blog](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team/Quality_Assurance_Team_Blog) and its ensuing [QAT Gazette](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-09-07-qat-gazette-september-2017), this was one of the main ways updates to the Ranked section and its systems were announced by the hands of the [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team).

Fast-forward five years later, the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) has decided to reinstate the Gazette with similar goals in mind — to connect with the community and issue updates on a periodic basis!

Without further ado, let's get to the nitty-gritty of this month's series of updates, shall we?

## Updates

For better organisation and to give users some time to adapt, the NAT will be deploying updates in batches. Once enough changes have been discussed and approved, these will be implemented in one fell swoop. The Gazette will try to keep up with this sporadic update schedule.

### Within the Ranked section

#### Blocking Qualified maps with pending problems

Qualified beatmaps with open suggestions or problem stamps in the discussion board **will not** move to Ranked.

In the case of a beatmap reaching its supposed ranking time and there are unresolved suggestions or problems, an NAT member will shortly step in and either resolve the post or disqualify the map depending on the validity of the concerns raised.

#### The ranking criteria cleanup project

There's currently a community-driven [ranking criteria cleanup project](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1836226) in the works which aims to overhaul the current RC to make it much clearer and more accessible in general. If you believe you can contribute something to it, we encourage to give it a shot to help the team out!

#### Ranking criteria changes

| Type | Change | Link |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **General** | Changes on how the `Featured Artist` tag should be used, and a special mention on how to credit AI-generated media in the beatmap's description. | [View changes](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/pull/10175) |
| **osu!** | Clarification on how to use hitsounds on actively clicked parts of objects. | [View changes](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/pull/10082) |
| **osu!taiko** | Relaxed the rest moment guideline for Kantan and Futsuu difficulties from 16/1–20/1 to 32/1–36/1. | [View changes](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/pull/9942) |
| **osu!catch** | Changed the CS and HP guidelines for Rain and Overdose difficulties respectively, and an extra guideline on how to use higher-snapped hyperdashes was added. | [View changes](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/pull/10505) |
| **osu!mania** | Key modes over 10 keys are now rankable so long they follow an allowed [playstyle](/wiki/Beatmapping/osu!mania_10K_plus_playstyles). | [View changes](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/pull/10138) |

### Within the Beatmap Nominators

#### Changes to activity requirements

Beatmap Nominators rejoining in good terms are now expected to reach their mode's [minimum activity requirements](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators/Rules#requirements) in the first 30 days since their rejoin. Make sure to take this into consideration before asking to join back into the team!

Additionally, we've decided to remove the probation-specific activity requirements and allow NAT members again to apply their own judgment when deciding if a BN needs to have their probation extended for the lack of enough nominations to evaluate. Do note that the regular minimum activity requirements still apply!

#### Joining & rejoining

All modes will now require **150 [kudosu!](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu)** to be able to apply, bringing osu!'s requirement in line with the other modes. Moreover, Beatmap Nominators leaving in good terms can rejoin the team instantly **up to one year** (as opposed to 6 months previously) after their departure! Members who got kicked for their low activity however, will now be able to submit a new application right after their removal, instead of having to wait 30 days.

Finally, cooldowns for failed applications have been reduced all across the board! The standard length is now reduced from 90 days to **60 days**, with reduced cooldowns being only **30 days** now. Failing an application will not be as punishing as it used to be, so don't be afraid to [apply to join the Beatmap Nominators today](https://bn.mappersguild.com/bnapps)!

#### Better visibility for BN preferences

Beatmap Nominators can now set their map and song preferences in the [BN Management website](https://bn.mappersguild.com), alongside their custom request criteria in a much more detailed way. This will make it easier for users to know who to request by parsing through the list of open members and their respective preferences.

Simply click on any user in the [home page](https://bn.mappersguild.com/home) to see their detailed request preferences as seen below:

### Within the Nomination Assessment Team

#### Evaluation changes

Activity evaluations will (mostly) be automated. The consensus and feedback will be set automatically, but these will still need an NAT member to check them before they can be sent. Additionally, a Beatmap Nominator's evaluation cycle can no longer be extended past 3 months.

#### The impact of our actions

To put it shortly, [SEV ratings](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team/SEV_rating) are no more! Beatmap Nominators will not have to worry about these numbers any longer. Instead, the system has been changed to aid NAT members when assessing the significance of a disqualification or nomination reset.

These will be measured by their **impact**. A reset can either be marked as *Minor* or *Notable* depending on the severity of the issue. As a rule of thumb, anything that used to be 1/1 or above in the previous SEV system should be considered as *Notable*, whereas anything below should be considered as *Minor*. Impact ratings are currently only visible to NAT members.

This change should hopefully help BNs not stress too much over arbitrary numbers, and help NAT members assess resets by their importance and not just by the accumulation of severity numbers alone.

## Milestones

Let's take a short breather from all the news above and go through some fun milestones gathered from the past 4 months!

### Badges

The following users have devoted some immense dedication to their craft and have had their efforts recognised through some shiny badges. We're very thankful for their dedication and drive to help keeping osu! awesome, either through nominating beatmaps, or administering the mapping ecosystem.
