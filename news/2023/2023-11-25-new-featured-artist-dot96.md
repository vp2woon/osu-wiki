**DOT96** makes their mark on our Featured Artist collection!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/390/header.jpg)

From *CHUNITHM* to *maimai* to *Tone Sphere* and more, **DOT96**'s diverse sound has been showcased across the rhythm game spectrum.

Here on osu! though, **DOT96** had a not-so-conventional introduction via [MAKE IT FUNKY NOW](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1485845) — a beatmap featuring storyboard trickery by [Aspire](/wiki/Contests/Aspire) contest champion [Mr HeliX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2330619).

[**DOT96**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/390) has **4** new tunes to sort through, one of which is bound to be the template for your next map.

Looking for some inspiration? Witness that storyboarding spectacle through the video below, then let your ears do the rest of the work through these previews:
