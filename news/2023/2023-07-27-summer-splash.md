Somewhere in the world right now, it's summer. And it's also (probably) the 27th of July, which so turns out to be an excellent day for a big Summer content drop featuring all your favourite things: art, audio, and achievements.

If you just want to get stuck into the thick of things, open up your game client and hop right into some new spectacular summery tunes by [Redside](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/184), one of our very own stupendously talented Featured Artists. This bouncy track is very aptly named as ***beachballs!***, and if you can stop uncontrollably dancing for ten seconds after hearing it, you might notice that it's a summer-tinged spin on the osu! theme song that we all know and love:

<div align="center">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aGBwDMIbATo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Especially intrepid mappers will also find that the track is now available over on [Redside's Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/184), so why not try making a seasonal creation all of your own?

With the mood set, let's delve into the winners from the Beach Episode Art Contest as voted by the community:

### Beach Episode Art Contest winners

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/banners/RedcXca-banner.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/winners/RedcXca.png)

**3003** adherents shed a single tear at the majesty of Alisa and Chirou basking in the cosmic sun that is fat Yoshi. Art contest veteran [**RedcXca**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14056601) is of course responsible for this artistic achievement, making this their first-ever top-voted entry. Congratulations, and well earned!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/banners/Saeka-banner.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/winners/Saeka.png)

[**Saeka**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18025047)'s striking rendition of a straw-hatted pippi, Alisa enjoying a popsicle and a suspiciously pale feline mascot splashing in the water trailed in close behind at **2905** votes, remaining neck and neck with first place for most of the contest. So close! The summer vibes are substantial in this one, and you know we love to see it.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/banners/LeeNarie-banner.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/winners/LeeNarie.png)

**2883** voters never saw the beachball coming from [**LeeNarie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2667849)'s rendition of pippi, Mari and Mocha soaking up the sun with a smidge of sports. The Taikonator watches on in horror as Mocha absolutely botches it. This one is another *really* strong entry in regards to the overall theme of the contest, colours, composition and all. Fantastic work!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/banners/KAITO-thighs-banner.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/winners/KAITO%20thighs.png)

[**KAITO thighs**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233) (more likely known as Dreamxiety) makes her return to our art contests, casually collecting **2779** votes with a candid shot of pippi, Mocha, and a don all playing around in the surf. Who knew the game mode icons worked so well as a pattern for a ring float?

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/banners/Tofumang-banner.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/winners/Tofumang.png)

It's an all-star cast this time around, with [**Tofumang**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4817223) entering the fray and scoring **2512** votes with his front-and-center piece sporting a positively *radiant* pippi spending some time with Alisa in the surf, and a don not far behind. Simply superb. What more needs to be said?

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/banners/Sjao-banner.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/winners/Sjao.png)

**2507** voters got caught up in the tide of [**Sjao**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7295733)'s creation, showcasing a lounging (and sparkling!) pippi in summerwear beneath a shining sun. It really is a battle of the art contest regulars this time around!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/banners/DGen-banner.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/winners/DGen.png)

**2329** voters joined [**DGen**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13290907)'s pippi for some refreshing treats on the beach, while Chirou and Mocha labour over a sandcastle in the background. There's glamour, there's glitz, and there's the ever-present summer sun. A scintillating entry, indeed!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/banners/Hecatia-banner.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/winners/Hecatia.png)

**2280** voters were prepped to catch some sick waves with [**Hecatia**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8244635)'s surfer pippi. That's gnarly, dude! The good kind of gnarly. By the way, does anyone else think that surfboard design is seriously legit?

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/banners/ksenikust-banner.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/winners/ksenikust.png)

[**ksenikust**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8938068)'s seriously stylish pippi enchanted **2146** voters with her overwhelming star power and many osu!dachi™-branded drinks and accessories. Any resemblances to a tiny squealing Bocchi are purely coincidental.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/banners/Type-banner.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/winners/Type.png)

[**Type**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7520534) comes out of left field with an INCREDIBLY cinematic entry, gaining the attention of **2127** voters! Air, earth and sea are the name of the game here with this absolutely beautiful rendition of their signature style that we first saw only last year during the New Beginnings Art Contests. Amazing stuff!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/banners/ZunK-banner.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/winners/ZunK.png)

**2112** voters couldn't help but smash the like button on [**ZunK**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1070783)'s piece portraying pippi, Mocha and Aiko trying to nab the perfect summer shot to put in their scrapbook of memories. W-wait, Aiko wasn't ready! Redo!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/banners/Novarece-banner.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/winners/Novarece.png)

**2082** people waited in line to order from [**Novarece**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18728833)'s beachside stall featuring a smoothie-toting pippi expertly multitasking while preparing delicious food and drinks. This begs the question, if you order a set of beatmap pancakes, do they come in a set? We may never know.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/banners/tehfire-banner.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/winners/tehfire.png)

**2039** voters kneeled before [**tehfire**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7082924)'s insanely stylish pastel portrayal of pippi, Mocha, Mari and the Taikonator living out the good life on a beach in perhaps the most painterly piece we've seen yet. What a creation!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/banners/Amplui-banner.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/winners/Amplui.png)

**2012** divers held their breath along with [**Amplui**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24820805)'s Mocha to see who'd tap out first. Hint: it's not going to be her, since you'd never want to make that adorable face frown, right?

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/banners/Infinity21_EXE-banner.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/179/winners/Infinity21_EXE.png)

**1809** voters shared a peaceful moment with [**Infinity21_EXE**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23873884)'s take on Alisa enjoying a picturesque rest by the seaside. Less is often more!

### peppy's picks

Wrangling code and configuring lasers is hard work, but rest assured, the Dean "peppy" Herbert has taken some time from his schedule to wield the mighty power of The Pick, as is our tradition (sometimes). When we asked to describe his choices, he simply opted to unleash a defensive beam into the ceiling and fled without further explanation.

That's summer for you!

Much like combing for shells on the beach, you never quite know what you'll find when the Picks get involved — that is, unless you open up your game client and go looking! Know that any entry not featured in a banner up above that appears on the main menu was one of peppy's personal picks, and that there are **eight** of them to search for.

### New Hush-Hush medals

AND THAT'S NOT ALL!

To really crank up the heat, we've dredged the darkest depths of the distant seas to summon forth **eight** new Hush-Hush medals for the ravenous achievement hunters among us to prepare themselves for.

Dive into some of the most confounding creations since [some girl in a forest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-09-09-how-zetera-became-a-medal-hunter) thwarted people back in Halloween 2017. View them all below, courtesy of the meticulous medal mavericks over at [Osekai](https://osekai.net/home/) (who are solving these riddles as we speak, at an alarmingly quick rate actually):

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/727-medals.jpg)

Yes, you read that right — perhaps we've just lost our minds from the summer sun, but we're so confident in the challenge posed by one medal in particular that we're going to spice things up with a seaside bounty:

The very first person to successfully unlock the **Internment** medal will receive the highly coveted *Medal Hunter* title.

That's it! Decipher the clues and unearth any of these eight seaside treasures for fun and glory.
