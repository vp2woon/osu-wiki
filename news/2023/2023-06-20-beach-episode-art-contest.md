The most requested fan art contest theme has finally arrived: the hallowed beach episode!

Yep, you read that right. It's officially swimsuit time!

It's been hot as hell this year, so what better way to welcome things in than with everybody's favourite anime staple:

**Draw any of the official or community mascots having fun at a beach!**

That's it! If it's an activity someone can, might, or reasonably has had at a beach before, it's fair game if you draw any one of our mascots doing them.

In case you live in a cave and have absolutely no idea what a [beach episode](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode) is even referring to, here's some ideas to get your creative cogs churning:

- Mascots engaged in high-stakes hit circle beach volleyball
- Yuzu and the Taikonator engaged in sand castle siege warfare
- Mari decimating a watermelon with a stick alarmingly close to Mani's head (who is of course, buried in the sand)
- Mocha hunting for crabs in the surf
- pippi surfing a bitchin' shorey with a pair of shades on (no we will not elaborate on this slang)
- Seaside cooking stall shenanigans with a shop owner suspiciously similar to the Dean "peppy" Herbert
- Cinematic scenes of playing with fireworks on the beach at sunset (do not forget the bucket)
- ...and basically anything else you can think of that might feature in a beach episode!

Go hard on the trope. Channel your inner kid — what makes the beach fun? Inflatable beach balls, umbrella... seaside dune buggy racing? As you can probably guess, this is a very wide theme and can be *so much more* than what you might initially think. Do whatever brings you joy (as long as it fits within the rules)!

Got that? Great! Now, sit down a second, since we need to get a bit serious here. **If you intend to enter, please read the next paragraph.**

We know that *historically*, people have gone a smidge overboard with the whole swimsuit thing. Like somehow assuming less is more (a.k.a. not having very much swimsuit to speak of), or *more* is **MORE** (a.k.a. imbuing the mascots with overly large breasts). Please keep your choice of attire *and* configuration for the mascots you draw tasteful, reasonable, and suitable.

There will be no hidden badges or prizes for drawing comically inappropriate pieces — they just won't go up for voting.

With all that out of the way, you've got **30 days** from the date of this post to make your creation happen. We know that naturally, this means most of you will forget about it for 27 days then frantically scramble to whip something up in the last 3 days, as is tradition. The top three finalists will receive a custom profile badge of their winning work, and all finalists will receive 3 months of osu!supporter.

Also, we have a little bit of a *surprise* planned for the culmination of this art contest. We hope you look forward to it!

Check out the full set of rules before you begin:

## Rules

- **By submitting your artwork to this contest, you grant us permission to use your artwork in the main menu client should it win, and to use it in promotional material for both the game (osu!) and the contest (Beach Episode Art Contest).** You retain all rights to your creation and you can sell it and distribute it however you like — it is your work, after all. We're just saying here that if you submit your piece to this contest, you should be okay with us using it.
- **All entries MUST follow the contest theme ("beach episode/having fun at the beach") and contain AT LEAST one of the osu! official or community mascots.** We don't think any of you will have problems with this one!
- **All entries MUST be suitable for all-ages viewing.** See the entire paragraph above for more details, but to summarise, keep any mascots, swimsuits and anything thereof you draw tasteful. Think the kind of thing you'd see on a Pokemon episode aired on TV, and you'll be alright.
- **Be sane about your swimsuit designs, if using them.** Yes, we feel this warrants mentioning twice. If you're uncertain whether what you want to draw will be okay, you can [email Ephemeral](mailto:ephemeral@ppy.sh) about it with an attached sample of your design and he'll let you know where to go from there. Please allow at least 48 hours for a response.
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK. REDRAWING AND COMPOSITE WORKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** Plagiarism sucks. Don't do it. Someone in the comments will call you out for it as has happened every other time someone's tried and they're going to do more damage to your reputation than us removing your entry from the voting will do. Use only your own work — brushes and the like are fine, but that's it! Don't redraw someone else's work.
- **AI art generation methods are not allowed.** This includes any kind of software that has you supply a written or visual prompt and fills in large amounts of details for you, and features in software like Adobe's generative fill, etc. We also acknowledge that this stuff is everywhere now and we have *science* employed to help detect it.
- **Artist attribution (names, social media handles, etc.) must be limited to no more than three lines total and confined to either the bottom left or bottom right corners of your entry.** Being proud of your work is good, just do it in a reasonably small spot of your work. One thing unique to osu!'s history is that we really don't like forced advertisement, and attribution that is too large can come across like it.
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece — namely 2732x1536.** But no worries, the contest system won't actually let you mess this up anymore! Progress!
- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed on the main menu and during the voting process.** Very simply: anything in the big white circle won't be seen during the voting. Don't leave a big white hole in your piece either, please!
- **Do not leave the dotted osu! cookie template visible in your submission.** The osu! cookie template is not featured in any known beach episode and it should also not be featured in your works. That's just how the cookie crumbles.
- **Treat copyrighted characters from other intellectual properties with respect, and use them sparingly in your work.** Remember that every character, mascots included, are someone else's treasured creation, so please wield them with the same love and adoration you'd give your own OCs and work. Egregious or otherwise excessive use of other copyrighted characters (to the point where they're very much the main focus over our mascots) may disqualify your entry.

When you're ready to submit your entry, head on over to the [Beach Episode Art Contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/179) and follow the prompts.

Good luck!
