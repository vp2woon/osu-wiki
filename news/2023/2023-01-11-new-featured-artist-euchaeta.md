**Euchaeta** brings some novelty into our Featured Artist catalogue!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/333/header.jpg)

Japanese-style instrumentation, folk-inspired vocals, and VOCALOID are some main ingredients behind **Euchaeta**'s eclectic music. A master of his craft, **Euchaeta** has been designing musical journeys since 2010, and they've only recently been noticed by our circle-clicking community!

**9** tracks unlike anything you've ever heard are available at your digital fingertips via [**Euchaeta**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/333). Grab them while supplies last (a.k.a. until the internet stops existing).

If you haven't heard **Euchaeta**'s sound yet, that's about to change. Witness [Regou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/419954) play through [A Songwriter's Cosmos](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1858201) with mouse only, then follow your gut by clicking on every other preview:
