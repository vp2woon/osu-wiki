Japan may have won the [osu!taiko World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC) for the 10th year in a row, but this is the first TWC with **5 brand-new songs** created specifically for the tournament!

We call those songs [**osu! originals**](/wiki/osu!_originals) because... they're original songs made for osu!. While our names lack creativity, the creativity in the new songs from [2023's osu!taiko World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2023) makes up for it.

Check out the new tunes for yourself:

### Toromaru - Sleight of Hand

High-tempo jazz is [**Toromaru**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/279)'s specialty, and it perfectly suits the rhythmic complexity that osu!taiko needs.

[Sleight of Hand](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972518) mapped by [Nurend](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9905079) slotted into the [Semifinals mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2023#semifinals) as a *No Mod* pick, and led to *two* matches that were decided by less than 20,000 score!

### LV.4 feat. Mawata Spica - Vortex of Sorrow

As a master of hardcore and trance, [**LV.4**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/214) ensured that anyone listening to *Vortex of Sorrow* would be immersed in endlessly pounding bass and classic synth melodies.

[This beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1980701) by [uone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5321719) acted as a *Free Mod* pick in the [Grand Finals mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2023#grand-finals). If you think you can handle peak osu!taiko gameplay, give it a try.

### Aquestion - Umami Blaze

Considering [**A? / Aquestion**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/173) is [an osu!taiko player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12011880), it's no surprise that they know exactly what it takes to create an engaging song for osu!taiko.

[Umami Blaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1976814) mapped by [youtune3](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6442010) was part of the [Finals mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2023#finals) as a *No Mod* pick. Even if speed is your specialty, this **336 BPM** map might be a bit fast for you.

### 7_7 feat. kasane vavzed - 7D

[**7_7**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/356) was [revealed as a Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-04-23-new-featured-artist-7-7) alongside the [Grand Finals mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2023#grand-finals) showcase just a couple weeks ago, pulling yet another osu!taiko resident into our Featured Artist catalogue!

For pure chaos, give your best attempt to [this map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1980743) created by multi-talented mapper/composer [7_7](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7491106)!

### Gram - Sigrdrifa

The **Grand Finals tiebreaker** has always been the climax of any tournament's mappool, so bringing [**DJ Genki / Gram**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/295) on board was a must.

Prepare your hands for over 5 minutes of [this 8.5-star map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1981053) created by [Nifty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4956097), [rubies87](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4949934), and [_mtk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9468283). Try not to get any 100s on those last 4 notes too. :)

Of course, if you're interested in mapping any of these new tracks, they're available as pre-timed beatmap templates on each artist's listing!

- [**Toromaru**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/279)
- [**LV.4**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/214)
- [**A? / Aquestion**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/173)
- [**7_7**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/356)
- [**DJ Genki / Gram**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/295)

We'd also like to give [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718) a pat on the back for coordinating the creation of these original songs with TWC's mappoolers. None of this would've been possible without his help!

Keen ears may have also noticed something special about this year's osu!taiko World Cup mappool: **every song was part of our Featured Artist library!** This is the first time any world cup has used exclusively licensed music, showing just how much music we've licensed over the last few years. (Thanks for that too, mango.)

That's all for now! A new Featured Artist will be arriving this weekend, so stay tuned for that.
