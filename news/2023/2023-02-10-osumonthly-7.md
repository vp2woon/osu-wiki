New year, new osu!, right? Catch up with all that's changed since last year!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-02-10-osumonthly-7/banner.jpg)

Welcome to the 7th edition of osu!monthly! It is hard to believe that it has been 7 editions, 7 months of writing for the community. While the new year brings in new changes and more excitement for the upcoming year, know that if it happens in osu!, we've got it covered, though we cannot always cover everything and are always looking for content curators, writers, and osu! enthusiasts to come and help out. If you are interested or have feedback don't be shy and let us know in the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy).

This one came out a little later than usual due to unexpected delays, so thank you for being patient.

The osu!monthly [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1614314?n=1) has somewhat been disbanded after a lengthy discussion in how to reduce bloat and improve readability of the newsletter. Instead, it has now been transformed into a permanent [osu! wiki page](/wiki/Community/osu!monthly#contributors) listing the "osu!monthly team" that'll be used to sign the newsletter.

If you'd like to look at the previous editions of osu!monthly then make sure to check out the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/osu!monthly) that lists not only this revival, but all other editions of the infamous project.

Now that we have finished rambling, let's check out what January had in store for us!

## What's new in osu!(lazer)

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6Y9B1pyIcw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

As osu!(lazer) is getting closer and closer to what the community would consider a "full release", more people have been getting engaged with the game, submitting pull requests and reporting bugs. This has resulted in (along other things) many cool features being added, such as the dynamic BPM counter, various versions of the judgement counters and a new song progress display bar. No longer will live streamers and players alike have to download and use 3rd-party plugins in order to show these details, a common trend seen in osu!(lazer)'s development.

As you are probably aware of, in December a change was made that allows for users to obtain performance points for playing maps in osu!(lazer), albeit still having separate rankings from the current game. The launch was not ideal, but there was still a huge increase in player numbers — and most importantly, a lot of feedback was given to the team. That being said, as mentioned in the above video digest, peppy is communicating with various community members in order to discuss what balance changes should be made to the game, so be on the lookout as to what future changes might bring.

January has been full of small changes that add up to a big changelog, so if you are interested in the nitty-gritty of everything that's been changed or updated, feel free to either look at the video above or [read the full changelog](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog/lazer/2023.121.0)!

A huge feature of osu!(lazer) that's a complete game changer for people coming over from osu!(stable) is the fact that you do not need to have an osu!supporter tag in order to download maps directly — you can now do it directly from the in-game browser! You might also notice the fact that once a map is downloaded, it is automatically imported in the background (no need to press F5 anymore), and the in-game browser will show you which maps you already have!

## Community recap

### osu!stream available on Android

Back in the ancient days of 2011, [osu!stream](/wiki/osu!stream) was released onto the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/osu-stream/id436952197) on iOS, and it has been maintained up until 2020. For many years people have been asking for an Android release, but ever since the start peppy knew this would not be an enjoyable experience due to audio latency issues that were deemed inevitable at the time.

Well... 12 years later and [ThePooN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/718454) along with various open-source contributors finally made it happen! You can now [download osu!stream](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sh.ppy.osustream&pli=1) on your Android phone and enjoy unique beatmaps with mechanics only found on osu!stream (one example being the hold circle).

A few years back, all song DLCs were made free, so everyone will get a chance to fully experience osu!stream without needing to shell out money for the later additions to the song pool. Have fun!

### GMT applications

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/gmt-generic.jpg)

After a whopping 2 years since last time, the [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Global_Moderation_Team) [opened up applications](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-01-19-gmt-apps-now-open) for upcoming members last month. Specifically, they were looking for new chat moderators for languages where manpower was lacking.

The GMT is a group of community members who moderate chat, forums, beatmap discussions and also check for inappropriate user-uploaded content. New members are usually added through an internal [recommendation and nomination process](/wiki/People/The_Team/Global_Moderation_Team#how-to-be-considered).

These have already closed as of February 2nd. Good luck to all applicants!

### 4 Digit osu!mania World Cup (4DMWC)

It's surprising how much the tournament scene has evolved throughout the years in osu!mania. Even more so given how many people take it for granted. But after many years of unyielding dedication, we finally got to where we are!

Having been active users in the osu!mania tournament scene, players [Polytetral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8612061), [HowToPlayLN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10879600), and [DannyPX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11253722) alongside other contributors have [briefly gone through its history in article form](https://github.com/4digitmwc/media-centre-articles/blob/main/opinions/week3.md).

For anyone interested on contributing to or reading their periodic articles, you can find them all in the [official 4 Digit MWC website](https://4digitmwc.github.io/media-centre/) or by scouring through their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/4digitmwc/media-centre-articles). Also, a good way to stay updated with their ongoing tournaments is through their [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/4digitmwc)!

### Bosphorus Invitational

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-02-10-osumonthly-7/bosphorus-banner.jpg)

Hosted by [Zeus-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5464437) with the help and support of the [Boğaziçi University Gaming Club (BUOK)](https://buok.boun.edu.tr/), and sponsored by [Estanbul Esports and Gaming Center](https://www.estanbulgaming.com/?lang=en), [**Bosphorus Invitational**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1696844) is a 1v1 invite-only LAN tournament organised at Boğaziçi University South Campus, located right next to the Bosphorus Strait where the event derives its name from.

The tournament featured some of the best osu! players among Turkish rankings, who were invited to participate in a friendly 1v1 showdown throughout the day. Having taken place on 29th of January, the event featured approximately 70 attendees, all of whom hyped up to cheer for their favourite participant in the tournament and enjoy the engaging atmosphere.

Congratulations to [Raikouhou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8007528) for winning the tournament, and thanks to the players for their participation! If you've missed out on the event, you may give the below video clip a glance to witness some of the fun moments recorded at the venue:

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lunyl8O2ie8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*Special thanks to [emptypudding](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11003085) for the video clip.*

In case you wish to see how the matches went on, the livestream VOD can be found on the [BUOK Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1722657266).

### Community Choice 2022 voting open

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/162/header.jpg)

Last month, [votings were opened](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-01-24-community-choice-2022-open) for polls in all four game modes in order to decide the best beatmaps of the last year. Any map ranked during 2022 automatically showed up in the polls if you had played it at least once.

These votings have recently closed, so check out the results for each game mode below:

- [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/162)
- [osu!taiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/163)
- [osu!catch](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/164)
- [osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/165)

The winners of each game mode get profile badges, and finalists get 6 months of osu!supporter. Anyone who got their beatmap ranked in 2022 will also have their vote count towards the *Mappers' Favourite* category, the winners of which will be announced in a separate news post soon and receive a separate badge.

### Ranked statistics across osu!

The [Ranked section](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=ranked) is undeniably osu!'s poster child. New players, casual users, and diehard gamers all end up coming into contact with the content featured in there, and ever since it was first introduced, it has been evolving across the years. But how has this affected the amount of content being pumped out if we were to put it into numbers across all modes? In this article we'll compare 2021's content output with last year's numbers and its potential why's!

Starting with osu!, during 2022 **18,620** difficulties were ranked across **3,406** sets for a total of **37,954** minutes of content. This is a **3.9%** increase from 2021. While it might not seem a lot, we have to realise that the ranking queue during this period of time was almost always full! And the [small bump in the queue's size](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/issues/8547#issuecomment-1022821624) from 10 to 12 at the end of January may have helped just a bit.

osu!taiko, on the other hand, saw **4,873** ranked difficulties across **1,116** sets for a total increase of **37.4%** from 2021, amounting to **12,778** minutes of content. Thanks to the efforts of the taiko NAT and BNG, they were able to pump out quite a good amount of content, with no signs of stopping in 2023!

On the other hand, osu!catch couldn't *catch* a break, having an overall increase of **0.2%** with **1,780** difficulties across **364** sets being ranked or the equivalent of **3,593** minutes of playtime. We'd really hope that bringing these numbers up will encourage more people to help with the mode's content output.

Finally, our biggest outlier is osu!mania with **4,622** difficulties ranked across **891** sets for a MASSIVE **115.73%** increase, totalling to **12,000** minutes of content. This is *huge*. There are various reasons for this growth to have happened. Let it be a good increase in the number of BNs, recent and impactful changes to the way hitsounds and spreads are handled in the mode, or the community's proactiveness at making the mode better, just to mention a few examples.

We really want to thank everyone who was involved in making content for the game. It keeps it alive and well! Even just a small grain of sand can build big sand castles, and we hope for the numbers shown to put that into perspective.

Many thanks to [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335) for giving us this data to work with. We hope that it is as interesting to us as it will be for you, the reader!

### osu! Rankdle

Experience a unique project brought to you by [clxxiii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10962678)! [osu! Rankdle](https://rankdle.clxxiii.dev/), a spin-off of [Rankdle](https://rankdle.com/) will make you put your skills to the test and guess a player's rank based on their osu! gameplay. The site is currently in beta, and clxxiii is continuously improving it to provide the best experience. Be sure to check it out and see if you can rise to the challenge.

### Notable osu! plays of the month

2023 started off with a bang, with [lifeline](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11367222) being the first person to [HDDT FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4356860873) the top difficulty of [Reol - No title](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/320118#osu/714001), one of the most played maps ever. Next to that we have [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902)'s [2nd 3 mod FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4357810044) on [KOTOKO - Wing my Way](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/12035#osu/46827), which was previously FC'd only by Adamqs (one of the greatest 3-mod players of all time).

Alongside these two, we have a couple of more cool plays such as [MineFrostID](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12159899/)'s [2nd HR FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4368139903) on [Ekoro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/284905)'s map of [UNDEAD CORPORATION - Everything will freeze](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/158023#osu/555797), [xootynator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598)'s first [HDHR FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4363537357) on [DragonForce - Inside the Winter Storm](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/613814#osu/1294935) and [chocomint](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493)'s first [HDHR FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4367683519) on [Roselia - Ringing Bloom](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1066605#osu/2233275).

Check out lifeline's play on *Reol - No title* below:

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nz29w31jpM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Notable osu!taiko plays of the month

[shinchikuhome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3174184) strikes again! This time, being the first FC on a map considered by many to be one of the hardest maps currently Ranked. This map is Nepuri's set of [Kobaryo - New Game Plus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/797710#taiko/1675265), a 9* map that remained un-FC'd for nearly 4.5 years, until this month. Known for its near-impossible 400 BPM dense speed sections, it was recently FC'd by shinchikuhome with a solid 97.46% accuracy, earning them #1 on the map. If you haven't seen this play before, or want to rewatch it again, please check it out below!

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AI1OZBOkxMM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Another notable play worthy of mention this month is [Majimanjiwwwww](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12337864/taiko)'s HDNC 1218 pp play on [Null Specification - Aletheia (fake lover, fake summer)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1895850#taiko/3907074), earning themselves the pp record and #1 on the map! This map is notable for its 300 BPM streams, only made harder with Hidden and Nightcore, making it well deserving of the record. Feel free to check it out below!

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbtrG3OCdsw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Notable osu!catch plays of the month

You might be surprised to see [Imperial Circus Dead Decadence - Yomi yori Kikoyu, Koukoku no Tou to Honoo no Shoujo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/461744#fruits/1031991) in the osu!catch section, but believe it or not, this map has enjoyed great competition over the years, culminating on the play [ArMa79](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4982799) set this January, marking the first-ever FC on this more than legendary map that's jam-packed with insane tech and precision patterns.

The incredible effort put out by ArMa79 to defeat one of the hardest convert maps in the game is truly admirable. However, this is not the only convert map this month, as we've seen a new DT PP record for this category of play. We are of course talking about [Aryssiel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2389481/fruits)'s 1-miss play on [AKB48 - Heavy Rotation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1524839#fruits/3119805) with DT, tragically choking an even more impressive 860 pp play.

To put this into context, the [previous record](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/fruits/207475584) held by [b-a-d-s123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3656717) on [Bliitzit - Team Magma & Aqua Leader Battle Theme (Unofficial)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1002271#fruits/2097898) is only 724pp, we wish the best for Aryssiel if he ever tries to fix this choke.

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3gvbI7qierI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Notable osu!mania plays of the month

Unfortunately the monthly team did not see any mania plays worth mentioning this month, but if you believe this is incorrect feel free to reach out to us either via the osu!dev Discord server or reach out directly to [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063) and [kadoen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12780575) who are in charge of this section.

## Mapping recap

Our team is growing, and we are trying to meet your expectations by being as objective as possible and offering content that will appeal to as many people as possible. But this section is still a work in progress, so we invite you to come and give us your opinion if you have the time! The beginning of the year has been quite productive in terms of mapping, and we'll see about that together.

If you want more official information about mapping, BNs or the NAT, please go to the [Mappers Guild website](https://bn.mappersguild.com/home).

### Mapping highlight

Like most osu! players, you may be content with the beatmaps already installed on your computer, but new extraordinary and trendy beatmaps are released every month and pass the Ranked status. In this section we will keep you up to date with the most popular beatmaps among mappers & players.

By the way, even if we don't mention all the beatmaps that have been ranked this month, you should know that they are all great, so don't hesitate to take a look at the beatmap section of the osu! website and check out the most recent beatmaps!

#### Leah Kate - Life Sux (Sped Up Ver.) - Community favourite

After the great success of the Leah Kate maps [10 Things I Hate About You (Sped Up & Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1881428) and [Twinkle Twinkle (Sped Up & Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1901049) mapped by [Log Off Now](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4378277), [Life Sux (Sped Up Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1905234) mapped by the same person was equally well received. Leah Kate is an artist who has not been seen much in the Ranked section so far and who was a real discovery, thanks to her catchy music and her beautiful voice. With beatmaps that are always pleasant to play no matter the situation, and new music, Log Off Now has definitely the winning wicket to please the players!

#### 15 Voices - Non-breath oblige mapped by Delis - Community favourite

If you checked Twitter even once this month (or towards the end of December), you'll probably have seen clips of the best osu! players trying out this map to get the best plays. We're obviously talking about [Delis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1603923)' set on [Non-breath oblige](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1889729), which was more than well received as the mind-blowing number of favourites the set showed us — reaching almost 1,800 in a month thanks to the fact the mapset had a difficulty that was able to challenge all skill levels thanks to the multiple GDers in the set.

#### Pmarusama. - S'il vous President - osu!monthly Mapping Team's favorite

Are you *-w-* or *-v-* ? If you haven't understood yet, we are obviously referring to [S'il vous President](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1763440) hosted by [TtmnZk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2495509) and more particularly its Extreme difficulty by [nika mika](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3878832) with its more than amusing concepts on a lively song, with many patterns in the form of emojis and punctuation throughout. It's definitely a conceptual yet fun way to represent such a catchy tune, making for one of many reasons we appreciate the map and encourage you to go and have a look at it!

#### HOYO-MiX - The Stellar Moments Vol. 2 - Bonus

With such a huge and ambitious project, we could not have failed to mention it here. Compiling almost thirty minutes of tracks from Genshin Impact, [The Stellar Moments Vol. 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1702721), a sequel to the already very popular [The Stellar Moments](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1588624) mapped by [Shurelia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3807986) and with participation from ~20 mappers, it's a real masterpiece. Linking two very popular games with excellent craftmanship and originality, whether it be through the amazing mapping, the perfect hitsounds, or the not too intrusive storyboard, this map guides the player through a stellar experience. We really invite you to go and try it out!

### Mapper highlight

Obviously, behind each beatmap and difficulty on osu! is a mapper and hours of work to produce this grouping of notes that you play, so we wanted to put here some of the mappers that have stood out from the rest this month. Keep in mind that all the mappers are doing a great job even if we only select some of them, so you should definitely check out everyone's work!

#### VINXIS - Best Mapper

[VINXIS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/22), besides being one of the most popular Featured Artists of osu!, as well having been the head of many community projects that have pushed osu! to new heights, like [Corsace](https://open.corsace.io/info), [MCA (Mapper's Choice Awards)](https://mca.corsace.io/2021/) or even the [AYIM (A Year in Mapping)](https://ayim.corsace.io/2021/), is a very-known mapper. This month he said goodbye to the community on January 1st, erasing all his digital identities to focus on his real life, but he still left us with 6 excellent maps that were ranked this month and we urge you to check them out, such as [Utada Hikaru - PINK BLOOD](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1490238) or [Kenshi Yonezu - KICK BACK (TV Size)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1864478) which have already been very positively received by the players. We obviously wish him the best and hope that people as involved as him will take over!

#### chaser01 - Rising Stars

Quite active in the Ranked section since the beginning of 2022, [chaser01](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18730172) is now starting to accumulate a large portfolio. With a total of 13 beatmaps, 2 of which were ranked this month, he often changes up his style. For example, there are beatmaps of his that can be visually rather classical like [Kaori Oda - Sekai no Hate de](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1829057), or more conceptual like [Tyler, The Creator - I Ain't Got Time!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1844850#osu/3789610), but they always represent the song so well making them all enjoyable to play. This is definitely a promising mapper that we should continue to see progress in the future with many beatmaps ranked to come!

#### KennethBBG - Rising Stars

Here is a person who is really on the rise. Until the end of 2022, [KennethBBG](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13032817) was still part of the big family of mappers with about five Ranked maps, but since this January, he hasn't stopped for a second and has ranked about 6 more maps! That's an astronomical amount that surely required a lot of effort, but it made him jump straight into the big league with rhythmic and Japanese music like [Akizuki Kanna (CV: McLaren) - Only you! (Short Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1853621). We hope that he will continue like this and that other people as motivated as him will do the same in the coming months!

### Mapping around the community

Numerous projects, small or large, managed independently or by large teams, and with the aim of reaching out to the osu! mapping community, are created regularly but often have too little visibility. We will therefore try to summarise in this section the various events accomplished by the community, throughout the month.

#### A Year In Mapping 2022

At the beginning of the year, this small project made by [YamYA](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4470854) was much talked about because it presents a very visual way of viewing the data of maps ranked throughout 2022. In this way, [A Year In Mapping 2022](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/394c39bb-6630-4ff7-9794-6ae73b2e7d95/page/hj1uB) using the [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/) tool has made it possible to enable filters to display statistics only for certain countries or modes, allowing mappers to see where they stand in relation to others. If you haven't had a chance to take a look yet, don't hesitate!

#### The Mappers Table

[The Mappers Table Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@themapperstablepodcast) is a group of mappers now consisting of [hanabyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8617799), [CallieCube](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7535045) and [PaRaDogi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2054596) who have this month produced the first episode of a podcast about mapping. This month's guest, [Camo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5194391), spoke with them about different topics around mapping such as their favourite maps, or more complex ones such as whether "fun" also means "good". In short, a new ambitious project by the community for mappers that we hope will be a success and last for a long time.

#### MasterMapper 2023

Have you been looking for a serious mapping tournament for a long time but can't find one? Then hurry up and sign up for [MasterMapper 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1699534?n=1), which is accepting participants until February 4th. This tournament hosted by [Gordon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7856835), now in its 3rd iteration, brings together mappers of all levels (within certain criteria such as having been active recently, or having Ranked maps) to compete on Featured Artist tracks over several months. Don't hesitate to take a look at it even if you just want to see the submissions!

## Skinning recap

### Skinning news

#### The osu! 2023 Skinning Poll

On January 16th an official poll has been opened up to the public in order to gauge the general opinion on the state of skinning, not only from the skinning community's perspective, but also from the entire player's. The poll is already closed, however you can still contribute [through the forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/15) if you think you have an opinion worth sharing. Be on the look out for when the results are announced on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) and in the [skinning forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/15)!

#### Skin of the Year 2023 voting is now live

The skinning community has been hard at work creating new skins for others to enjoy, so we highly encourage you to check out its [announcement news post](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-02-09-skin-of-the-year-2022) and cast your votes!

### Featured skins of the month

As should be tradition by now, 3 skins from the month of January have been selected to be showcased on osu!monthly:

- [Skadi Arknights](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1706882?n=1) - Inspired by Skadi from *Arknights*, this skin revolves around an obvious theme while still keeping to minimalism, especially in the gameplay section.
- [Pink Bean - MapleStory](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1700282?n=1) - Pink Bean from *Maplestory* is a memorable character, and this skin pays homage to both the original game and the beloved character with its style and design choices.
- [5WC 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1699533?n=1) - A skin made specially for the upcoming 5 Digit World Cup 2023 tournament. Created in the author's consistent and gorgeous design style, as well as following this year's branding for 5WC, it truly shows how much love and care the organisers put into their tourneys.

## Did you know?

The art and name for [osu!stream](/wiki/osu!stream) came from a community member! In mid-2010, [Koko Ban](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/60603) on the forums would [show off their idea](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/13087?n=645) for a different version of osu! by posting a fan concept. The community received it really well, and when peppy decided to work on this iOS version of the game, Koko Ban was commissioned to do the full visual game design. Thanks once again to [Kurboh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15243233) for providing this cool titbit of osu! lore and to [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) [for confirming this via the osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/188630481301012481/1003689172420276246/1068522857262489700).

## Monthly community quiz

We admit that the last month's question (*What class must mappers experience to create perfect sliders?*) was brutal, and we'll be looking into balancing the difficulty over the next few issues.

The correct answer was "05Z2", referring to the presence of a "perfect curve" slider type in the osu!(lazer) editor, along with this banner that was at the bottom of some (very) early builds.

By the way, "05Z2" itself is a reference to the `.osz2` file format, which is used internally in the game servers and osu!stream.

Anyway, on to this month's question. It's February, Valentine's Day is coming soon, so here's a nice lovely question for you all:

*In which osu! beatmap can you find the circle of life?*

Good luck to everyone, and as always there's a month of osu!supporter up for grabs to the first person to get a correct answer!

## Things to look out for in February

- The [Twin Trials mapping & storyboarding competition](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-02-01-twin-trials-contest-beatmapping-phase) has been announced, and it is split into two parts to accommodate for both map creation and storyboarding. If you have not by any chance seen this on the front page, check it out now! The winners of the beatmapping and storyboarding competitions will get a chance to combine their creations and have them included with every new osu!(lazer) installation.
- The [Roundtable II qualifier tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1699086?n=1) has commenced, with the best osu! players in the world battling out to be one of the two people that will get a guaranteed spot in the upcoming Roundtable II LAN tournament that will be held in Los Angeles, CA. What makes this prize even more tempting is the fact that all travelling and living costs will be covered for the two winners!
