This is old news already! Another player was able to break the record during the Finals weekend. Read on for more details and to find out which remaining team made it to the podium next to Australia and South Korea.

### ::{ flag=DE }:: Germany vs. ::{ flag=US }:: United States

After Germany got revenge against Canada (7–1) for their loss in the Round of 16 and the Americans took down the Filipino team 7–3, it was time for another edition of this matchup. The US roster had the better start, instantly winning the first break point on [Marina Inoue - Watashi no Ki-Mo-Chi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2091807#osu/4384690) for a 2-0 lead. 

The German squad picked and won the aim-focused map [RAISE A SUILEN - HELL! or HELL?](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1251944#osu/2602090) to keep the American team close. However, the possibly most valuable player of the United States, ::{ flag=US }:: [Rektygon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7813296), replied with a full combo on [Mayumi Morinaga - Boutokuteki Sentaku no Alegria](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2091805#osu/4384687). His excellent accuracy meant a new OWC performance point record of 763 pp. The US roster took the momentum of this huge play and continued winning map after map. 

Including a beautiful full combo by ::{ flag=US }:: [Vaxei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4787150) on [Nanahoshi Kangengakudan feat. Hatsune Miku - No.39](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2091778#osu/4384633), the North American team went for a 5–0 run and converted the first match point into a victory. However, the community regards this outcome as "one of the closest 7–1 victories in OWC history" as the German roster lost five maps with a less than 150k score difference. They miss out on the World Cup badge for the first time since 2019.

### ::{ flag=AU }:: Australia vs. ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea

[**View the VOD here!**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1987813835)

The Aussies are known to have the best speed roster in the whole tournament and thus, they went for the fast maps such as [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2091805#osu/4384687). But somehow, South Korea was able to beat them on that pick for a 3–0 lead. With the loss on a confidence map, Australia needed to boost their morale.

::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902), the current #1 player of the game, showed his magic at this crucial timing. He landed three consecutive full combos which includes an insane performance on the difficult Hard Rock tech map [Aoi - Quartzshaper](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2091789#osu/4384670). His plays helped Australia massively to get back on equal terms.

At 3–3, the Korean team chose the low AR map [nui - Mayday](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2044442#osu/4267100). This might have been the deciding pick of the match. The full combo streak for mrekk came to an end and the all-star ::{ flag=KR }:: [worst hr player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14106450) started to shine. His impressive showing continued with a full combo on [NM5](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2091742#osu/4384562) resulting in a complete momentum shift favouring South Korea.

The Australian squad could not catch a break and thus was defeated 3–7 after an impressive 4–0 run by the East Asian team. They will now wait for the winner of the battle between Australia and the United States and only need one single match win to become champions.
