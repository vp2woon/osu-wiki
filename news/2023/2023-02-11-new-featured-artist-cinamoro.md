**Cinamoro** blends artcore and rhythm game composition styles as our newest Featured Artist!

Korean producer **Cinamoro** (formerly known as *artifact* or *artworld*) may be a relatively new face to the rhythm game scene, but you would never guess that from their music. Sporting the stylistic prowess of a composition veteran throughout their countless song releases since 2019, **Cinamoro** has earned their place in our Featured Artist collection.

**6** outstanding tunes have made the journey to [**Cinamoro**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/341). Pick them up while supplies last (which is forever)!
