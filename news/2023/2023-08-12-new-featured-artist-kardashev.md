Your fingers quiver as **Kardashev** engulfs our Featured Artist library.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/375/header.jpg)

Merging death metal with shoegaze (and a heap of other flavours), **Kardashev** has been outputting a distinctly atmospheric style of metal for over a decade. And as of today, that sound is officially part of osu!.

**12** mind-altering tracks can be found on [**Kardashev**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/375), including a few beatmap templates that combine certain intro/outro tracks, like [The Approaching of Atonement + Silvered Shadows](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1889320). Feel free to start mapping any of these insanely dense songs (at your own risk).

Speaking of hopeless cries for salvation, we asked [A L E P H](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6735738) to play the infamous spaced-stream beatmap [Cellar of Ghosts](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1804362) at [COE](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event/2023). See how that went for yourself:
