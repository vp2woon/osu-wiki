Summer might be coming to an end, but Project Loved returns to keep the good times going!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

For everyone who's not yet familiar with who we are and what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As is tradition by now, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the July votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

Last month, we announced that the Project Loved osu!mania 4K team was accepting new captain applications to add some new captains to bring you all a set of new keys to smash in the Loved category. Thank you to everyone who applied for the position of osu!mania 4K captain, and out of the dozens of applications received, we're proud to welcome the following players as your new captains:

- [YuEast 2018](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13953619)
- [Silhoueska Elze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)
- [SunApple](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11817622)
- [elexire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9206093)

On top of the aforementioned additions, we would also like to welcome [MegaMix_Craft](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711) to the Project Loved Team as well, as they are joining the team as a description reviewer to help ensure the quality of Project Loved news posts & captain descriptions!

Welcome aboard, and we hope to see some great results from our newest additions to the Project Loved Team!

With all good things, however, they must always come to an end. [_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750), one of the most dedicated and longest-standing osu!mania captains in Project Loved's history, having left and rejoined the team before, has announced that they are resigning from their position as osu!mania captain to make way for the 4 new additions. On behalf of the Project Loved Team, thank you for your contributions to the project & team, and we wish you the very best on your future endeavors.

We don't have any more news to share regarding Project Loved, so let's get into the picks for August 2023:

231 BPM, 2:17 | 2.20★ – 8.29★\
*description written by [Kingling](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7010761)*

With over 130,000 plays, what better map to pick for this month's *Popular Playcounts* pick than [Tempestissimo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1185696#osu/2471434) mapped by [Shrukaghn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6304675)!

Quoted directly from the mapper themselves: "just a little hard" perfectly describes the top difficulty of this absolute behemoth of a mapset. Over 2 minutes of pure 231 BPM madness with cross-screen jumps, spaced streams, and the craziest of slider shapes ensure only the best of the best can play this one!

However, if that's all a bit too much for you, fear not! The mapset has a full spread of difficulties right down to a 2.2★ Normal, so each and every one of you can enjoy this banger of a tune. What's not to love?!

The *Outstanding Oldies* pick for this month is the well-renowned [elchxyrlia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1722835)'s map of [Wakeshima Kanon - killy killy joker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/187406#osu/447144).

You might have seen this map back when [Vaxei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4787150) set his iconic [HDDT 1 miss in 2019](https://youtu.be/tFZ6xT_pvzY), or even back when [chocomint](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493) was [playing this with HR in 2015](https://youtu.be/cUbt_D9XGAA). This is a 180 BPM, 6.59★ map featuring a plethora of bursts, streams and wide jumps to really put your skills to the test. Mapped in 2014, this definitely has a spot for the *Outstanding Oldies* slot, having aged like fine wine. Gathering 73,000+ plays and 250+ favorites, there's no doubt that this deserves a place in Project Loved.

Our *Small Spectacles* pick for August is a collaboration between two very familiar mappers, [Alumetorz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1145984) and [Avena](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2198472) (previously known as Priti)! Being exceptionally known for their maps such as [Memme - Acid Burst](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/302535#osu/678106) and [gmtn. (witch's slave) - furioso melodia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/280107#osu/633993), you can only expect an amazing fusion of a super clean and a super classic "2015-style" tech map. At 6.09★ and a little over 5 minutes, this map does not let down with the consistency. And better yet, you can jam out to this *Featured Artist* track by none other than [Camellia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31)! d-_-b

...well, that's a mouthful. Either way, this beatmap is the pure definition of a human benchmark test, and has been used by speed-dedicated players for years to test their skills and check out how much their fingers can handle before they violently explode into a pile of rotten... Oh, I'm receiving information that I am not allowed to try and match the brutality of this song's theming. Sorry, guys! But the map is pretty hard. Good luck!

If you want to see the best of the best speed players competing for the top spot in this map, make sure to vote yes!

From our very own Featured Artist [UNDEAD CORPORATION](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/45) and mapped by [Ekoro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/284905), you know you're in for a treat with this set. This *Ranked Reject* was originally mapped back in 2015, the days of the original *Time Freeze*. With a top difficulty of 9.27★ and a BPM of 280, if you're looking for a similar taste, this map is perfect for you.

This sister map has needed a home for a long time now — can you help make Loved that place?

As always, simplicity runs a long way. If you've been around for quite a while, I'm sure these DnB mapsets are not unfamiliar to you — the galvenize classics. These mappers show what it's like to map some chill drum and bass in true *galvenize fashion*, with difficulties sitting shy only at 4.73★ and 5.01★. Put your guards down, and let your cursor float, loosen up your tapping fingers, and settle down for something less chaotic for once — which is what this mapset is perfect for.

Do you love doubles and finger control maps? If so, then you'll love this month's #3 *Wildcard* pick, [Do you love me? feat. rintaru](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1235834) mapped by [lcfc](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7322726)!

*lcfc* has been known for their techy maps, and this map isn't an exception to that, either.  A map that is heavy with fun alternating rhythms and sliders, combined with slick movement, doesn't fail and makes one hell of an epic map, only sitting at 6.24★. These are the kind of maps I imagine myself putting in a multiplayer lobby, and the map I imagine everyone loving by the end of the map (multiplayer fiends will understand how big of a claim this is). It's that concoction of being challenging, but also, really fun and not torturous at all.

No further explanation needed. Go `!mp make` your lobby and run up `!mp map 2569027` now so you'll believe what I'm getting at.

Not often does osu!taiko see rap music, but when it does it's guaranteed to be special, and *Till The End* is no exception! This unique take on mapping uses vocal-focused 1/6 snaps and exceedingly comfortable patterns make it flow excellently and your fingers truly feel like they are dancing across the keyboard while playing.

Believe it or not, we also feature easier maps in Project Loved!

[Discord (The Living Tombstone's Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/762931) is a really satisfying, flowy map that is probably one of those you knew as a beginner and still enjoy as a more advanced player. With SV changes going slower and slower, it's also quite good at introducing players to the slow SV reading skillset, making this addition to the Loved category very much needed!

Have fun!

[Virtual Riot's *CHROMA*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1550719) by [\_Rise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5217107) is an all-time favourite among tournament players and poolers alike, and it's easy to see why.

*CHROMA* is an amazing tech map, challenging the player's ability to reach and play different snappings. This map really hits the spot with testing players' technical skillset. This map is playable, but can also be challenging, both for higher- and lower-ranked players!

I definitely recommend giving this map a try if you are into tech challenges. Perhaps some of you will even be able to conquer *CHROMA* with DT. 👀

[Rahatt - Gas Gas](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/858060#taiko) by [applerss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/983349)\
190 BPM, 2:24 | 5.93★, 6.91★\
*description written by [Horiiizon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8071438)*

*Gas Gas* is a classic map from a mapper who I'm sure many of you already know, applerss! The top difficulty (aptly named "Gas Gas") is an unconventionally challenging tech map, featuring a variety of 1/6 patterns and 1/8 doublets. The most difficult and unique part of the map, however, are the extremely fast **1/16** doublets weaved in between other patterns! All of this mixes together to make a very engaging and distinct difficulty. The lower difficulty "Gas" strips back the doublets entirely and simplifies the 1/6 patterning, making for a simpler but still dense map!

[Katagiri - Baby, Please](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1671952#taiko) mapped by [Loveriche](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14892190) (previously known as Cure when this map was submitted) consists of 2 difficulties with different but very well-done styles! The "easier" (although still extremely difficult) "Kill Me" clocks in at 240 BPM and consists of mostly medium-length patterns, with the hardest parts being the longer streams that are a mixture of 1/4 and 1/6, which happen each time the song transitions. Most notably, the stream at the start of the 2nd kiai is only 1/4. However, it is a finger-cramping **257** notes!

The harder difficulty "Kill Me Faster!!" is a truly brutal speed map, with the BPM increasing from the previous difficulty to **288 BPM**. What makes "Kill Me Faster!!" stand out is the variety of patterns as well as the map having almost no room for rest, because while there aren't any streams above 100 notes, there are several long back-to-back streams throughout the map which are sure to drain your stamina. Make sure to warm up!

Originally made as a commission for [TWC 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2022), this insane collaboration effort by [Backfire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/263110) and [Waribashi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2250574) (a.k.a. KTYN) brought to the table one of the most difficult "consistency" maps out there, and considering the multitude of finger-twisting patterns and the nerve-wracking density of notes, it's quite obvious this is up to Grand Finals levels.

But for those who are quite up there but still far from playing at a TWC Grand Finals, *Waribashi* also includes his own *HELL//ONI* difficulty featuring much more forgiving patterns and very few unfair patterns, while also retaining much of the hype and stamina requirement of the original.

[PinocchioP - Tonchinkan Feast](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1215136) is a very challenging speed map with a BPM of 290 and SR of 6.87, but it should present a higher level of challenge when played! Also, the OD is a whopping 7.5! Can you get an S rank, maybe even an SS!?

My beloved Nekomusya7563 is so sweet that there is also a short version diff for us!!! (Thanks <3)

**You** will be the one to submit the best play! Let's take the challenge!

All of them are stream maps with simple SVs and patterns, but don't think it's easy, because every difficulty has its own challenge. Are you ready for this?

*description written by [fuhie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7620002)*

Have you ever seen a natural bodybuilder and went: *Wow, this guy looks like he lifts*. Let's say for example, his physique was similar to [Jackhammer Madness](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/354231), the [ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) left-right map.

So then, the next day you're out shopping for groceries at a store and you see this 250 lb man, under 9% body fat, shopping for carbs and protein in bulk. Your eyes bulge out of surprise as you, the observer, had just seen a bodybuilder the previous day and admired his seemingly hard, undetermined work to be the best out of his generation in terms of his body size and strength. Well, let's call this "250 lb, 9% body fat" bodybuilder *Mad Machine* by Syrsa.

You ask the man, since you are determined to know his ways, "HOW DO YOU DO WHAT YOU DO? WHERE DO I START?"

He tells you one simple answer. "Wiggle. 270 BPM. To failure."\
You say, "WHAT? WHO WANTS TO EVEN DO THAT?"\
He says with a look of fear on his face, "I don't do it for myself. I do it because ExGon made me do it."

Yeah. Talk about hardcore. But also imagine if you could be that guy. Well, ExGon is a coach after all. We can start on building your forearm muscles with [Mad Machine](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/521977#fruits) by Syrsa.

Created by *ExGon* to be quite, literally, a Mad Machine (this is not your average gym machine), I can assert with absolute confidence that with this map, if you play it well enough, hard enough, and long enough, you will BUILD MUSCLE in your FOREARMS playing this.

You thought *Jackhammer Madness* was enough? You're foolish. THIS IS THE SON OF THAT GREAT EMPEROR. 270 BPM wiggle madness with spinner memory at the ending, you're in it for the pain. If not, why are you here?

Hitting the balance near perfectly between HR, HD, and NM, (and potentially DT for the truly daring), this will be able to provide countless replays of entertainment at varying levels. Just... don't ask *FDF* why it's not CS 5...

Here we have [Beat in Angel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/288571) by a group of talented mappers from the osu!catch community that most of you will already know, whether you are a newer or older player.

If you are a player just starting to get into playing osu!catch, this pick will be perfect for you. This mapset contains several difficulties, going all the way from a Salad up until the Rain difficulty.

Whether you are playing the Salad or the Rain, you should have a good time playing them as they are very consistency-focused. There are no weird jumps or patterns that jump out, so all in all a very nice and clean consistency mapset.

Once you have played through one of the difficulties and still don't feel festive enough, try playing it again but this time with the provided skin enabled!

Could you imagine yourself put in a situation where you went to visit the largest osu! meetup in the world, COE, only to forget to pick a Loved map for Wesley, to then pick your map and forcing you to write up a description for [Animal Land](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/879643)?

Well, now I can.

Anyway, meow meow meow, I dearly hope you like cats, kittens and anything in between if you decide to play this map. Jokes aside, this map once more reflects [Kukkai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7811952)'s quality mapping by being a very uncontroversial map; there are nought experimental patterns and the map itself is not only playable by the top 1% of players. Thus, although perhaps not the most extraordinary of maps, *Animal Land* is definitely very enjoyable for its ease of play and flowiness.

This also makes it very mod-friendly. I will give my usual recommendation of trying this map out with Hidden or Hard Rock if you find it lacking spice, and at this point in time it might not even be too controversial to suggest that some people might even enjoy playing this with Double Time; due to the map being primarily jumpy, there aren't too many death streams that would instantly fail your run on the map if you were to pick up a couple of misses.

Despite all this, I can definitely assure you that the enjoyment of this piece is primarily dependant of one's musical taste. To me, it once more re-assured that I am a dog person, but I am sure a lot of you will feel differently. So go check it... *sigh*... meow...

[arccat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4848294) is certainly no stranger to the beatmap creation scene. He already has a couple of Ranked maps to his name and other maps that have been featured in numerous tournaments. However, with his debut in the nomination for Loved beatmaps, we present: [Crankin](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1838002#mania)!

*Crankin* offers a variety of challenges in the SV department. With its teleports, incorporation of LNs, and numerous BPM changes all throughout the beatmap, it is no surprise that this was one of the many custom charts specifically made for the [MWC 4K 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K) Semifinals mappool. I guess compared to the previous SV picks in that tournament, you could say that they were *crankin* up the difficulty, am I right?

Do you have what it takes to match with the rest of the top players in the world? Or do you just want to have a fun test in the SV category?

For more answers to your questions, feel free to engage with the thread, and do not forget to show your support to the creator by giving it a vote as well!

Similar to the already loved [Wh1teh Pack #3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/509116#mania/1082726), this pack is an assortment of 17 maps, most of which are from the *Etterna* pack [Fennec Fallacy](https://etternaonline.com/pack/96653), including every type of rice patterning imaginable. And, with the sheer number of maps, there is bound to be a map that players will know and love. This pack includes many very well-known maps, such as *Around The World*, the 132 BPM jack map used in the [MWC 4K 2018](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2018_4K) Quarterfinals and countless other tournaments; *To The Limit*, another jack map that is most known for being in a *certain* four map long marathon course; *MATZcore*, a 234 BPM jumpstream map that continually throws rolls, trills, and of course streams at you; *Scrap Syndrome*, a brutal combination of both jumpstream and awkward trills; and so much more.

From newcomers to top players, this pack offers something for everyone. If you want to continue to see even more Wh1teh charts become Loved, be sure to show your support by giving this one your vote!

[IcyWorld](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1383951) needs no introduction. Having been around in the VSRG space since 2007, it's a challenge in itself to not know who he is. With it now being just over a year since his last Loved map, we're bringing him back with his rendition of [SUIKINKUTSU](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1083786#mania/2266610)!

Unlike previous waves, this time around we've picked something a tad different from his traditional jumpstream maps that we've all come to know and love. *SUIKINKUTSU* is a near 7-minute long jazz marathon, with the patterns having different gameplay aspects depending on what instrument is being focused in the song. This ranges from the single stream speed sections to the more minijack-oriented sections, allowing for what plays and feels like a very accurate representation of the song itself. Being fairly similar in nature to *RAISE MY SWORD*, this chart is easier in difficulty, allowing for a bigger audience to enjoy it. The unique song choice combined with Icy's charting abilities definitely calls for what is one of his best experiences.

Coming from arguably his most popular *Etterna* pack, [Icy X](https://etternaonline.com/pack/51), it's no question as to why this chart is so well known. If we consider the length of this song, alongside how it's garnered the play count it currently has with no added rates, it's more than clear that this chart has gained the reputation it deserves. If you're a fan of jazz, marathons, the charting, or all of the above, show it your support by giving it your vote!

[Everything Will Freeze](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/298452) is one of the most popular osu!mania graveyarded sets. This set is authored by [Meggumi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5360699), [Aste-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4915137), [bilqiscutee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3845961), [inbee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4319126), and [Valentrixe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2794620).

As an old popularity pick, this set is a blast to the past and is a 4K spread that you would typically see ranked in 2015–2016.

We know that many players (especially beginners) will enjoy this set despite the age, and this is as straightforward as it gets. It caters to quite a large audience as a result, although you should be prepared for the infamous jumps into hands on the top difficulty.

Let us welcome both [MEIDAN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9600264) and [8230](https://https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9950563), as they make their way into the Loved category through their interpretation of *Frontier Explorer*!

Being one of the more rice-oriented beatmaps in this pool, *Frontier Explorer* offers you two different types of challenges. Black Another throws you with a huge amount of speed patterns, in which a lot of sections test your ability to not only go as fast as you can, but also how well you can read the rolls and transitions in between. Having the proficiency to determine which note to hit while also hitting at the perfect pace is certainly vital to getting an amazing score on this map, and if this is something that you are great at, then this map is for you!

If not, then [8230](https://https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9950563)'s Another offers another kind of challenge. It may not be as fast as Black Another, but it does have a variety of triplets in the middle of jumps. This difficulty, on the other hand, tests your ability to play at different time signatures (or in other words, technicality). Accuracy is very important in this kind of map, as with the different timings, there will definitely be moments wherein you suddenly just mess up your hands a little due to how difficult it can be to execute.

Once you are able to do these well at normal speed, then why not test your limits? Don't forget, this mapset also offers you rates from 1.0 up to 1.4!

[CrewK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11488604), or as people mostly know him, Kururu (no, not the girl one that spins uncontrollably if you do certain things in that other game), has something up for you. You'd probably find yourself surprised that he often maps quite a few things, but none of it seems to stand out very much. Except for one — his rendition of an LN chart that is popular and a fan-favourite of tourney players. Stand back, 'cause we got [Slluuddggee](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1671903#mania/3414825) comin' right up for ya'!

For something to work so well for an LN chart such as this one, you might be wondering why it got popular really quickly, even it's still within a year since its creation. To tell you the truth, I honestly have zero idea about it. Yes, I'm telling you right now — CrewK has a distinct charm of making stuff that is not just fun, but also unique in a sense that people come and gather around to see plays from the chart. Ditto can be said about the other difficulty in this mapset (zero thoughts invested about that reference). And for some reason, it just... works. Tournaments love to pick this kind of stuff, and people don't seem to be arguing much about it!

For better or for worse, this is the standout from CrewK, being the best they have to offer right now. And as time goes on, who knows if there's going to be a sequel to this chart that absolutely shines the same way as Slluuddggee does. Only one way to find out — and that is to support this mapset as a whole package!

[qodtjr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3021168) is back with a stamina-heavy chordstream chart in his old style.

[toromi hearts 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/458563#mania/982566) is similar to many entries in the Loved selection of charts of [SSjoy Dan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/621216) in that there is a heavy focus on brackets and stamina drain. There are two gauntlets of long, dense chordstreams with especially heavy one-hand brackets that make it difficult to keep any semblance of consistency if you do not have the stamina. However, you should not expect much after the end of the second gauntlet, as the ending of this chart is very easy in comparison.

This was a very popular chordstream chart for its high level back in the day, and therefore it would bring good legacy value to osu!mania's Loved category.

If you want to see more difficult chordstreams like this in Loved, be sure to support qodtjr in the Loved voting!

The \[EX Challenge \[0.95x Rate\]\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\

We have some easier chordjacks for you this month with [L99](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1427458) by [hoo9030](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7466406)!

This is a spread with 3 difficulties. Each difficulty increases the density and the amount of jacks present, although the EX chart is quite easy in comparison to the other two and is mainly intended for 7K players exploring jacks for the first time.

A 0.95x-rate chart of the *EX Challenge* difficulty was used as the chordjack pick in the Quarterfinals round of [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_7K), although we will not be using that rate for Loved.

Make sure to vote for [L99](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1427458) if you support moving it to the Loved category.

[TatshMusicCircle(Tatsh) - Raikou-3rd Desire-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/315341#mania) by [tangjinxi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2270126)\

The last time [tangjinxi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2270126) had a chart Loved was in August 2019. He finally returns to the Loved nominations with his chart of [Raikou -3rd Desire-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/315341#mania/703125)!

This is an old-school O2Jam-style chart that we realize many players have come to appreciate for its oddly satisfying charm and great legacy value. There are O2Jam-style brackets, wild SVs, and even shield walls present in the chart.

Many high-level LN players would consider this a classic. This chart is certainly a step back in time, and many players from the newer generation may not be familiar with it. However, this is something that is rather common for O2Jam.

If you want to see more O2Jam-style charts like this in Loved, make sure to give tangjinxi your vote.
