VOCALOID beatmaps are rooted in the early days of osu!, and **Yokomin** is here to keep those origins alive.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/355/header.jpg)

**Yokomin**'s unreasonably catchy tunes penetrated the osu! community in 2016, becoming a household name in the Ranked section ever since.

As of today, **11** of those songs have officially become part of osu!'s Featured Artist library. [**Yokomin**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/355) has the goods, and you *hopefully* have the mapping skills to bring this music to the wider osu! community.

**If you *don't* have those mapping skills,** we'd also like to not-so-subtlely plug the `#featured-artists` channel in the [osu!dev Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ppy), where you can get feedback on any of your Featured Artist maps!

Once you develop your mapping ability, you can also post your maps in that channel for use in [osu!(lazer) Featured Artist playlists](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists)!

Anyways, back to **Yokomin**. Take a peek at the video below to see how different mappers have interpreted one of **Yokomin**'s tracks, then maybe even play some maps for yourself:

There's more where that came from. Pre-timed beatmap templates for the rest of **Yokomin**'s music can be found on [their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/355), so make something cool (and post it in `#featured-artists` for some quick mapping advice).

The week may be at its end, but that just means there's another Featured Artist on the horizon. The [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) may or may not have details on that. You'll have to check to make sure.

Stay tuned.
