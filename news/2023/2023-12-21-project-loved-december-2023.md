To those still unfamiliar with what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As always, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the November votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

To close out yet another amazing year of Project Loved, let's begin with our last *Popular Playcounts* pick by welcoming back an Arles classic by [elchxyrlia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1722835)!

Among his list of massively popular mapsets, one word is all it takes for thousands of players to instantly recognise [Sakamoto Maaya - Okaerinasai (tomatomerde Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/313906#osu). This time around we are treated with three difficulties: Arles, An, and Filtered sunlight. Each of these difficulties get significantly harder than the last, peaking at 7.83★ and all featuring big jumps, short bursts of streams and japanese vocals accompanied by drum and bass. Whether you're looking to seriously improve your skills, warming up or just looking for fun maps, *Okaerinasai* is a map everyone is bound to enjoy.

I've been hungry for more Arles maps and I'm sure many others feel the same way, so let's vote to see this Loved!

[Zektbach - L'erisia (Primal Logic)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/64010#osu) by [AngelHoney](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/104401)\
234 BPM, 1:38 | 7.61★\
The \[Insane\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)*

For the last *Outstanding Oldies* pick of the year, what's better than going... *primal*?

As I keep on going with the trend of nominating the OG "too hard to be approved" maps, here's [AngelHoney](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/104401)'s map of [L'erisia (Primal Logic)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/64010#osu). Created back in 2012, it has aged gracefully as is tradition with other AngelHoney maps. Ever since the old times, this map has always been associated with a certain **top** player. This was mostly because he was the only one who could even play this, which **left** people speechless at the time, and even today it is nothing to scoff at.

If you are willing to take on the challenge, get ready to test your aim as nearly screen-wide angled jumps dance around with spaced 234 BPM streams. Well, it is nearly 8★ for a reason. But don't worry, it is only OD 7, so you will surely be able to get good accuracy on it! ...That's how it works right?

Would you like to see top players duking it out on who can set the craziest score on this? Then make sure to give your vote for this map!

Welcome to the final *Small Spectacles* pick of the year, [With Confidence - Voldemort](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/491875#osu/1047994) mapped by [HanzeR](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1592447)! If you've been around for long enough, you'll probably know the mastermind behind the (in)famous map [Nhato - Miss You](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/155691#osu/381798), which many have considered to be very ahead of its time. Sitting at a reasonably hefty 6.59★ and 207 BPM, *Voldemort* sports fun jumpy "NM1" patterns mixed with some tricky burst patterns and stacks. Don't get tripped up now!

If you want to see this map as a new addition to the incredible Loved library, then make sure to cast your vote!

Does anyone else have a craving for sliders? Worry not, [Halgoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4109923) is here to serve us a fine course with his beatmap of [Rory in early 20s - Wa Yoderi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1765605#osu) in this year's last pick of *Daredevil Difficulties*.

If you're a big fan of Halgoh maps like me, you're in for a treat because this map is as Halgoh as it gets. Enjoy three minutes of pure Halgoh as you experience his never-ending variations of bursts and iconic tech sliders, with his own hitsounding featuring hundreds of samples to accompany this beautiful breakcore track.

As a wise man once said, *I think this has to be awarded the "kiai that goes hardest" award*. Well, I can't offer such a thing, but I think that giving this masterpiece a leaderboard is the least we can do. So vote now!

136 BPM, 4:28 | 7.25★\
*description written by [megumic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7537133)*

**The following messages for the *Gameplay Gimmicks* pick are satire and are not to be taken seriously. Viewer discretion is advised.**

I really love [Koalazy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/286740). Like, a lot. Like, a whole lot. You have no idea. I love him so much that it is inexplicable, and I'm ninety-nine percent sure that I have an unhealthy obsession. I will never get tired of playing his unique and mesmerizing beatmaps. It is my life goal to meet up with him in real life and just thank him for the incredible masterpieces he's crafted.

I fall asleep at night dreaming of him creating a personal beatmap just for me, and then he would be so sorry tired that he comes and shares his insights on mapping while we discuss and analyze scores together. If I could just exchange a conversation with him for a brief moment, I could die happy. If given the opportunity, I would eagerly discuss 2B slider ideas just to hear what kind of creative insights he would share. Then, I would brainstorm new concepts while he provides constructive feedback, and the slider patterns would become sillier and sillier.

I would give up almost anything just for him to acknowledge my efforts. No matter what I do, I am constantly thinking of his innovative approach to beatmapping. When I wake up, Koa%wer is the first thing on my mind. When I go to school, I can only focus on his mapping style. When I come home, I go on the computer so that I can try out his latest beatmaps. When I go to sleep, I dream of playing his beatmaps with him. He is my inspiration, motivation, and joy. If he were to say I got a good score, I would probably get overwhelmed by the dopamine and die happy.

I wish for nothing but his continued success in beatmapping. If it were for him, I would love [Camellia feat. Nanahira - I don't care about Christmas though](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1086293#osu) without any second thoughts. Without his influence, my osu! journey would serve no purpose. I really love Koalazy.

One of *Umineko no Naku Koro ni*'s most memorable pieces, coming from none other than osu's own Featured Artist [-45](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/297), [Rougoku Strip](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/583171#osu/1234064) is truly a majestic piece befitting only the perfect weddings. Those who are familiar with Loved might know some of Deramok's other maps, and if you've experienced one, you already know the treat that is in store. This CS 2, 6.74★ map is truly insane, the patterning really takes advantage of the larger circles in a way that you don't find often in mapping. Everyone should try this map out, and of course, read *Umineko*!

Bearing the well-earned *Elite Storyboarder* title, Exile-'s mapset of *Xepher* from 2016 is one of the most nostalgic maps for me. From 1.48★ to 5.62★, focusing on the 1/4-heavy nature of the song with various bursts and streams, there's almost certainly a difficulty for you. And as you'd expect from an Exile- map, there's also a clean storyboard that pairs well with the map, so make sure to enable it while playing at least once!

It allows you to improve your overall playing skills by taking into account not only speed, but also accuracy!

[Harvest (droplamp Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/772671) is a collaboration mapset between two well-known mappers in the Loved section, [Shallty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6205471) and [Yuni](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2250574) (now known as Macaroz and Waribashi respectively). Featuring two difficulties made three years apart in 2018 and 2021, this mapset showcases the timeless mapping of these mappers who have created countless enjoyable beatmaps throughout the years.

Both difficulties consist of 1/3 and 1/4 patterns that provide an interesting challenge at 260 BPM while maintaining great flow, attesting to the experience and effort of the mappers. While uncommon in the Ranked section, this mixed snapping is widely enjoyed by those familiar with Graveyard maps, and this mapset has gained significant popularity as a classic of this style. Let's take a trip down memory lane and give these nostalgic maps a try!

An osu!taiko mapping genius mapping a song by a hip-hop genius, how could that be wrong?

*For Free?* by Kendrick Lamar is a hip-hop jazz fusion interlude from this creative studio album: to pimp a butterfly. [Genjuro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3196091)'s amazing take on this song shows us he's one of the greatest minds of the taiko mapping scene. Using creative patterns combined with weird jazz snappings, he creates a perfect map for the tech enjoyers among us.

What makes this map extra special is that it's mapped to Kendrick Lamar's vocals instead of the jazzy background instruments, which creates a very unique playing experience.

In my opinion, this map is a must-play for every taiko player out there.

This *Night of Knights* remix by USAO brings a lot to the table, varying from tech to hardcore and hardstyle.

[#Fairy_dancing_in_lake](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/642247) is a classic tech map from the renowned [Nofool](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/672430). Whilst they are well known for their SV ventures, this by no means makes this map a disappointment! Combining comfy patterns of mixed snappings with an amazing track from *uno* (who you may know as RoughSketch) is a sure-fire way to make anyone dance right at their keyboard!

And for those who find Expert Oni a challenge, Insane Oni has your back with a more lenient mapping style, which has made it a popular tech pick in tournaments like [Ausu!Taiko Tournament 2020](/wiki/Tournaments/ATT/2020) and [Continental Global Taiko Showdown 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/CGTS_2021)!

If you enjoy this map as much as I do, why not cast your vote now? It only takes a few clicks to give this gem a leaderboard ready for brawling!

The strong wind is blowing, bringing with it something very interesting and different lost in the sea of beatmaps! I need to be brief as the wind is blowing strong.

This map will surprise you with each circle, as it is full of gimmicks of sliders, barlines, and spinners that make this map very interesting and fun. But now, put away your umbrella as the wind is blowing!

*USAO - Cyaegha* is quite straightforward on being what you'd expect of an average Inner Oni difficulty but with an extraordinarily spicy twist: using a little trick discovered by [katacheh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6651672) and [Fantazy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6890639) that consists on reskinning certain notes to create various effects such as fade-ins, fade-outs and even note swaps!

With this, an otherwise simply solid map becomes quite fun and enjoyable to play — just try not to get bamboozled!

Those of you who mostly play Ranked and Loved maps might not recognise the name [C-light](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7955738). However, those of you who played in tournaments (especially in recent years) are likely to recognise their name from mappools, especially *Kamiari Algorithm (feat. Lilia.) (katagiri bootleg)*!

*Kamiari Algorithm* was most notably used as FM1 in [SGTS 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1703263)'s round of 16 and is a perfect example of a non-antimod freemod map. It contains a great amount of variety due to the odd/even 1/4 rhythms, 1/6 sections and longer streams towards the middle and end of the map. *Kamiari Algorithm* uses these rhythms in sections for the most part, which gives the map a constantly changing and progressing feeling while also feeling comfortable and natural. This is achieved without the use of SV at all, which is also impressive!

This is C-light's first time being nominated for Loved, so give it a play and see what you think!

Let's start off this month with a banger by Rabbit House, [Rabbit in the Black Room](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/729195#fruits). It is a short and sweet map, so I will also keep it short and sweet.

The map features streams, normal and snappy jumps, which if you don't pay attention to, you will miss. While the map isn't too difficult by itself, near the ending are a bunch of snap jumps, which should be a pretty good introduction to those kind of patterns.

Try it out and see if you can overcome the snap jumps and perhaps even find the *Rabbit in the Black Room*.

This month we might be able to see a new face joining the Loved section, and that is [Cowboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1237535). While [Seija](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6443263), who mapped the kiai sections in this map, already has Loved maps, Cowboy doesn't have one yet. [o'er the flood](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1002377#fruits), however, definitely deserves a spot.

The map majorly consists of stream patterns and stream bursts usually connected with snappy jumps. Sometimes the patterns can be quite tricky, especially towards the end of the map, so it is easy to misread a pattern and mess up. Overall, the map is very clean and of moderate difficulty, which means that a big amount of players will be able to play this map without any issues. Just beware that the difficulty spikes in the last quarter of the map.

A good map for sure that deserves more attention. Hope you like it!

Enjoy an AR 8.3 reading challenge. HR player? Enjoy touch mechanics combined with CS 6.5. If that isn't enough, you can throw on DT to have a speedy mechanical map to be able to play.

[So CrewK went ahead and did it.](https://twitter.com/Crwt_speed/status/1733232716567757245) That is without a doubt, to this day, one of the greatest storyboard achievements the world has ever witnessed, and it only happened a week ago as I am writing this.

Believe it or not, this nomination was planned completely independently of this feat. [Evening](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2193881)'s *Spin Eternally*, one of their magna opera in terms of gimmicks, was instantly inscribed on our radars almost as soon as it was released. Its popularity was unrivaled from day 1, and hasn't really dwindled with time. One year later, here we are: finally adding a leaderboard to it ~~so that CrewK can FC it again haha teehee good luck mate ganbatte xoxo~~.

For those who don't know the map itself, [Spin Eternally](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1905308#mania) is an homage to [NotITG's modcharts](https://youtu.be/sBP8MxQhEVM?t=113) — a style of mania charting where moving the lanes themselves around is central. As a player, adapting to the gimmicks takes a lot of practice and trial and error as to how to approach reading, and the skillset sort of comes down to having experience with other gimmicks from other charts. Of course, *Spin Eternally* is far from the first modchart-style mapset we are nominating, but it is not a commonly tackled style of gameplay because of its high bar of entry.

Honestly, even at just one year of age, this nomination is long overdue. Go vote for it. I know I will.

To say that this is a tournament staple would be an understatement. Quite literally, it would take up too much space if I were to list all tournaments this has been featured in, but its most notable appearance would be in [MWC 4K 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K). The most likely reason behind its popularity lies within the approachability it has compared to the majority of the FFR-core-styled tech charts you'll find yourself coming across, which typically consist of heavy minijack usage and sudden bursts.

Even then, the added rates still allow for a great difficulty scale for the players who find this a bit too easy, or too hard, as there's a downrated difficulty. All these factors and gameplay elements have led this to becoming the go-to tournament pick you see it as today.

If you're aspiring to get better at the game, or if you're looking for tech that's more lax, then I assure you that's exactly what you'll get by giving this chart a shot (and your vote).

Don't get stung! Instead jam to the *merengue* rhythm of these chordjacks — this is a fan-favourite, and for good reason! It is not usual rhythm game music, but it is indeed very fun to smash some keys along with it.

Yes, you're seeing that correctly. It's time.

If I got a dollar for every time someone asked for this to get loved, I'd have, um... like ten? I haven't kept track, but one thing I know for sure is that you've been asking for this to go up nonstop. So, without further ado, we finally give you [DannyPX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11253722)'s chart of [H.A.R.D.C.O.R.E](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1275606#mania)!

While it wasn't an instant hit upon it's upload, the chart gained quick traction among the community due to the player [sel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9452257) setting, well, a LOT of scores on this, but their most notable being [this FC on 1.2x rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK6za04Zmg0). These plays then piqued everyone's curiosity, leading them to try this chart.

Of course, there's good reason behind this, as it contains a bit more spice than what you'd normally see in a handstream chart. Just casually looking past the 7-minute drain time (which is a big part in what makes this have the notoriety we know it for today), the patterns have loads of anchors and incredibly long trills, making it a bigger challenge for the people brave enough to try it.

It's pointless to continue any talking about this chart, as it's too likely everyone reading this is much more familiar with it than I am. It's also pointless for you to keep reading this, so stop listening to my incoherent ramblings and cast your vote!

[ricky bobby](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1626036#mania/3543459) on 1.15x was featured in the [Springtime Osu!Mania Free-For-All Tournament 6th Edition Round of 32 Mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/SOFT/6#round-of-32), and I can definitely see why this was selected for a tournament with high prestige, as this presents you with a myriad of challenges that you need to overcome in order to really set a good score on it.

Lots of this chart really makes you uncomfortable, especially with the presence of anchors, awkward rolls, and minijacks. In general, though, it is very easy to slip your hands/wrists, which could lead to rushes that result in bad judgments, or even worse, misses. It isn't surprising, however, to see the various technical patterns here, as [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707) is known for making difficult and quality rice charts, as her files were featured in a lot of tournaments already.

That is to say though, this beatmap would certainly prove to be a challenge as consistency was an issue even amongst the top players who had to play this in SOFT 6. Technicality is certainly one of the most difficult aspects of rice to master, as this not only gives you a test of how good you are in consistency, but also how accurately you can play the map.

Do you think you have what it takes to face the best players in the world? Is the consistency and accuracy challenge something you want to overcome? Then support this beatmap by giving it a yes vote!

Technicality, and long notes? Well, best to ask \[[Crz\]FolAH1217](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6232458) for those kinds of maps, as he is notorious for making difficult tournament maps for the LN and Hybrid category. [Retrospective Arabesque](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1741640#mania/3560499) is certainly no exception, as this on 1.15x was featured in the [4K Mania World Cup 2022 Finals pool](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K#finals).

That is to say however, even at base rate, that this proves to be a daunting challenge especially for players who are unprepared to see this beatmap. What makes this really challenging is the presence of minijacks along with very technical Long Note patterns, plus the numerous rolls and graces that this map also has to offer.

Overall, [Retrospective Arabesque](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1741640#mania/3560499) is very far from being a straightforward hybrid, which is definitely a testament as to why this was chosen in such a late round for the biggest tournament in the game mode. Sure, it may only be just over a minute long, but with the different challenges that this map has to offer, it would really require you to use a lot of your energy and focus for you to ensure that you can even get a decent score on such a difficult map.

Of course, you can definitely use the base rate to get better at these patterns, but once you are able to execute these, then you're surely able to work your way up to the MWC rate! That is to say though, no matter the rate that you are playing this on, technicality will definitely always be something you'll need to consider.

Please, give this map a favorable vote if the challenge that this map gives you really caters to the community! With so much of what makes the community the way it is on the present especially on the tournament scene (through much better acc, and also better LN proficiency), I can definitely see how this pick really tests the current generation of players.

It's not very common for new LN mappers to enter the scene and create so many charts for every type of LN gamer, but Castella is one of the few who have emerged in the past 2 years. They are well known for their classic O2Jam-style mapping, resulting in an overwhelming amount of super dense maps that players often challenge themselves with in trying to time properly especially on higher rates. With that being said, [Kawaikute Gomen](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1897904#mania) is no exception, featuring LNs that often feel like inverse handstreams.

Despite its seemingly daunting appearance, let it be known that this map is surprisingly comfortable to play. Perhaps it's how most of the releases are very uniform, or maybe it's the rhythm that adds to the overall timing of the song. Whatever it is, Castella did it perfectly, making this map super satisfying to play at any level.

Unlike what the song is trying to do, I don't hope you are pissed off after playing. Instead, I hope you'll be willing to show your support by giving it a vote. If you do, you may get a *CHUUUUUUUUUUU*. \*reads notes\* *Ah, sorry again, I can't give that.*

These charts aren't meant to be hard at all — whether you are an accuracy player looking for charts to score on or a newer 7K player looking to learn more of the basics of rice charting, you will find enjoyment in these charts.

Typically, most of our non-4K picks are very difficult for most of the community, but you'll find that all our of 7K nominations this month have some intermediate-level picks that shouldn't be too overwhelming.

If you want to see more of this in Loved, be sure to give taba2 and the rest of the nominations your support.

Simplicity doesn't have to be boring!

This is a mapset that features 2 well-known mappers and a newcomer, each showcasing their strengths and personal mapping style!

[xuiennie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13894647)'s difficulty is filled with unconventional stream patterns and is reminiscent of a rather old mapping style that has its own charm. The back and forth between 1/3 and 1/4 snap rhythms and simple but satisfying-to-play LN holds and releases keep the player engaged and focused throughout the map. When it comes to the patterning and mapping style this is definitely a case of "old but gold".

[JuHaa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15526127) returns with her signature style of creating simple and fun-to-play hybrid maps! Utilizing comfortable stream patterns and long notes to represent the violin, this difficulty shows a lot of polish and definitely her understanding of using simplicity to achieve fun and replayable maps.

[TakJun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4356322), the host of this mapset, also makes a comeback to our Loved section, as his top difficulty is a masterful work that showcases his rather Ranked-appropriate style of mapping. Rather than pattern diversity, TakJun focuses on accurate music representation and comfortability which are both really well implemented in this difficulty. It doesn't surprise us that TakJun has returned to the Loved category with this pick — we hope to see more of him in the future as well!

Here we have a popular mapset by [\_Reimu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6577242) with the top difficulty being a collab with [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750) that was used in [7K MWC 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_7K) as an LN density pick!

While Insane difficulty is quite chordstream-heavy and has a relatively difficult but fun-to-play chordjack section, it is well balanced by having enough breaks and less dense patterned sections to preserve stamina. It definitely is a great way for beginner-level players to get into intermediate-level territory!

The Sakura difficulty is where intermediate-level players learn the basics of high-level play. The first half is comprised of LN chords with varying lengths of LN holds and releases leading into LN transitions that test the reading ability of players (being able to read denser LN patterning is one of the key skills needed to progress into high-level maps!), while the latter half cranks up the difficulty with a short dense FLN section and replacing the LN chord section with an LN chordstream section! This map is to be considered an entry level hybrid map to high-level play.

Heartbeat builds on the fundamentals that were established in Sakura. The patterning is more complex and becomes physically demanding. This difficulty tests your consistency and focus on the highest level, having to accurately play minijacks in between LN chordstream sections and testing the player's ability to read dense LNs.

The collab difficulty made for 7K MWC 2022 is an altered and shortened version of Heartbeat to fit the criteria of LN density.

Given how memorable this pick has been in MWC and how well it tests the player's skill on fundamentals, this has been picked for a possible spot in our Loved section!

Okay, hear me out.

1K is not just meme vibro. You're not supposed to hammer that space bar with just one finger. You've got the entire length to use your other hand, your other fingers, and actually perform alternate hits with both of your hands! Some people even use 4 fingers (or more!) for really fast streams! In that sense, 1K is sort of closer to osu!taiko than osu!mania, funnily enough. So I guess this is a bonus osu!taiko pick!

Anyways, Jaye's One Key Event (JOKE) is a series of tournaments spearheaded by [Jaye](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4841352). It currently features 3 editions ([1](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1086975), [2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1430912), [3](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1829307)) and features, you guessed it, actual competitive 1K. Right at the inception of JOKE1, as a participant myself back then, the attendance pattern was incredibly interesting. The tournament caught the eye of osu!taiko players, as their skillsets transferred over to this key mode very well (except for long notes). Of course, Jaye being a top osu!taiko player also helped represent this osu!taiko presence. osu!mania 4K players were also interested in trying 1K out, as 1K, as strange as it looks, is still an osu!mania key mode. Oddly enough, even players from the main osu! game mode were signing in, albeit their skill transfer is a bit more subtle, but since you do have to have keyboard tapping skills to click the circles, it is still there!

As I am writing this, the third edition of JOKE is coming to its last phase: Grand Finals. And with Grand Finals, another original song: [1KONOS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2101561#mania/4408834). While JOKE3 hasn't had the time to qualify for it, this map pack features the best of JOKE1 and JOKE2, as voted by the 1K community. It features a mixture of many kinds of maps of varying difficulty, and even includes some SVs! We hope that this map pack encourages more people to try out this key mode from the basics, and gets people to compete on the hardest entries... including *1KARUGA*, the final boss of JOKE2, which hasn't yet been FCed to my knowledge.

What started from a "joke" is now a fully fledged tournament series with professional standards. Even as a passing curiosity, 1K is pretty fascinating in a global rhythm gaming context and deserves some visibility and recognition. Do give it a go, and a vote in the thread!
