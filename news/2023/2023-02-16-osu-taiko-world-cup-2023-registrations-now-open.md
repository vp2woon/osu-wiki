Bring along your favourite percussion instrument as we once again drum to the beat, as the osu!taiko World Cup is back for its 13th instalment!

The osu!taiko World Cup has a reputation among its managers as being a testing ground of sorts as far as the official tournaments go, and this year couldn't be any different – we are bringing back the 3 vs. 3 format, which made its last appearance in 2017, in the hopes that it'll shake things up a bit (looking at you, Japan). This relatively small change impacts many rules, so make sure to get up to speed by reading the [wiki article](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2023#ruleset).

Continuing our ongoing efforts towards diversifying the ways the community can contribute to the World Cups, we have created an **[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/osu-tournaments/events/osu-taiko-world-cup-2023-13130e56)** to allow for donations, which will be added to the prize pool at the end of the competition.

If you're still not familiar with Open Collective, it is a platform that allows us to coordinate the finances of the World Cups in a transparent way, and also allows users to help support the tournament in greater amounts outside of purchasing profile banners or subscribing to the osu!live Twitch channel. You can do any one (or all) of these things if you want and they'll still go towards the tournament!

You can donate directly to the prize pool of the upcoming World Cup of your choosing in a lump sum with or without an Open Collective account, and you can even leave a little message of support that will be displayed beneath your contribution, if you like.

*Please note that any "tips" made during the payment process go to Open Collective and not to us!*

For more details, refer to the [osu!taiko World Cup 2023 wiki article](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2023). You can discuss this event in the [official discussion thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1722224) or at the public [osu! community server](https://discord.gg/0Vxo9AsejDkGlk3H).

## How do I register?

- **[Click here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/37)**
- Teams will be formed by each country's captain *after* the registration phase has concluded.
- **The deadline for registering is March 01, 23:59 UTC. Make sure to get yours in before then!**

*Notice: you may only participate if your position in the osu!taiko global ranking is #5000 or higher, and you have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months.*

If your registration passes our internal checks, you will be placed on the candidate list for your country. When that country's captain has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

*Remember that any registrations submitted after the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances — submit your registration ahead of time to avoid any last-minute headaches. If you run into any issues, send an email to [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto:tournaments@ppy.sh).*
