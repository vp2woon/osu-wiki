**cygnus** (known here on osu! as [Matrix](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5052899)) is the embodiment of the circle clicker's dream: living in Japan and producing rhythm game songs all day every day.

While he began as a pioneer of AR 11 gameplay and later shifted his attention towards mapping, he's recently discovered that music is his favourite form of expression. Inspired by creators like our very own [*-45*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/297), *onoken*, and *SHIKI*, **cygnus** pulls off a distinctly old-school style through both his compositions and nostalgic sample choices.

**23** tracks are patiently waiting for your editor magic on [**cygnus**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/359)!

Given **cygnus**'s presence in the mapping community, it's no surprise that he wrangled a fair share of the mapping community into creating maps for his music. Below are a few examples of the awesome maps that have been made in the last few months, including maps by the artist himself:
