**tephe** has literally two songs. That's it.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/361/header.jpg)

While most musicians here boast years of experience and massive back catalogues of music, **tephe** is special. Their first release *Neppa* in 2021 became an instant hit with its J-rock style inspired by VOCALOID artists like *Jin*, *Surii*, *Tsumiki*, and *N-buna*.

*Neppa* is barely a minute long, so anyone could've predicted that it would be popular here on osu! too.

Check out both of **tephe**'s masterpieces from [their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/361)! ...or just scroll down.

If you've never heard **tephe**'s sound before, experiencing it through [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2)'s mouse-only gameplay is the best way to do it:

If you're looking for beatmap templates for either of these tunes, [**tephe**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/361) is the place to go. So go there. We'll wait for you.

Considering this release is a bit slim, we'll be announcing *another artist* this coming Saturday. Track the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) or the `#featured-artists` channel in the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) for the most up-to-date news on that, and we'll see you soon!
