We recently discovered an **Aquellex**-shaped hole in our Featured Artists library. It's fixed now.

If you're still itching for more chiptune after [last week's Featured Artist announcement](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-09-10-new-featured-artist-kommisar), **Aquellex** is here to satisfy.

**Aquellex** is no stranger to rhythm games. They've been a presence for years throughout the VSRG sphere, and here on osu!, that trend continues. **Aquellex**'s evergrowing talent for crafting densely packed chiptune tracks was first appreciated by the osu!mania community, so it's only fitting that they were revealed as a Featured Artist through [Cortex Charger](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2062236) — an [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals) created specifically for the Grand Finals of the [2023 osu!mania 4K World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_4K)!

**9** top-tier tracks are now in your hands. Pick up a beatmap template for your favourite track from [**Aquellex**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/380) and start mapping already.

If mapping isn't your thing, feel free to watch and play through these beatmaps instead. Maybe you'll be inspired by the end of your journey. ;)

As per usual, [**Aquellex**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/380) has everything above and more, all pre-timed and ready for mapping. We believe you know what to do with that info. So do it.

Speaking of things to do, we recently launched another batch of [**Featured Artist playlists** in osu!(lazer)](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists)! These highlight the most recent additions to our Featured Artist library, while also giving competitive players a way to earn a pretty profile badge. If you're not ready to become a mapper quite yet, this is for you.

Stay tuned for another artist reveal next week!
