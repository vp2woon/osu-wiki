**passchooo** joins the lineup of osu!-players-turned-musicians as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/366/header.jpg)

While [**passchooo**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6469085) has been a producer and vocalist for nearly their whole life, they only began to gain recognition on osu! after the speed remix [mrekk took over his WHAT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Rh8Cidvbrg&t=31s).

After being put on the radar, **passchooo**'s hip-hop-adjacent music has gained an audience here on osu! too, and with their upcoming release of *The Roundtable II*'s background soundtrack, they're only getting started.

**6** highly stylised tunes are ripe for the picking from [**passchooo**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/366)! Each are available as an already-timed beatmap template, so you can jump straight into mapping.

Every musician who played osu! has wondered how their songs would fit into the game. **passchooo**, after designing some of their music specifically for osu!, doesn't need to wonder anymore:
