One man's **Junk** is another man's treasure... in this case, more like a treasured new addition to our Featured Artist line-up!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/365/header.jpg)

Veteran producer **Junk** has been making music for almost as long as osu! has been a thing. First noticed by the osu!mania community back in 2014 through [Qualia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/177155), **Junk** has since become a classic among circle clickers and piano smashers alike.

**Junk** was already well integrated in the rhythm game community through *SOUND VOLTEX*, *O.N.G.E.K.I.*, and *CHUNITHM*, so we're glad to finally have them in osu! as one of our Featured Artists!

**6** tracks have made their way to the main stage (a.k.a. [**Junk**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/365)), all pre-timed and ready for mapping!

If you're curious how **Junk**'s sound translates to osu! (and osu!mania) gameplay, do yourself a favour and look below:

There's more **Junk** to go around. Check out [their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/365) for the full tracklist, including more insane tracks for your avant-garde mapping escapades.

In case you missed it two weeks ago, we announced some [new **Featured Artist playlists** for osu!(lazer)](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-06-03-new-featured-artist-andora#featured-artist-playlists)! If you're looking to play some cool new maps (or just want an excuse to try out the latest lazer update), this is for you.

And that's all for now! Another artist is on its way next week, so track the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) or the `#featured-artists` channel in the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy) for all the news on that.

See you soon.
