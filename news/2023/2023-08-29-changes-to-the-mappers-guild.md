The doors are wide open. Contribute to Featured Artist mapping and earn some cool stuff in the process through the **Mappers' Guild**!

Not sure what the [**Mappers' Guild**](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild) even is? You're not alone.

The **Mappers' Guild** is a community of mappers who create maps from the [Featured Artist catalogue](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) and [earn rewards](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#rewards) for their efforts. Since its inception, this MMO-inspired project expanded to [its own website](https://mappersguild.com) and now includes a bunch of other mapping-related opportunities!

This article covers new additions to the **Mappers' Guild** since [our last update](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-07-25-mappers-guild-updates). Skip to any section you're interested in:

- [Priority quests](#priority-quests)
- [Ranked map requirement lifted](#ranked-map-requirement-lifted)
- [Smaller changes](#smaller-changes)
- [Major contributors to Featured Artist mapping](#major-contributors)

## Priority quests

[**Quests**](https://mappersguild.com/quests) allow mappers to collaborate on simple objectives tied to each Featured Artist, like *"Create and rank at least 2 mapsets of songs by `artist`, each hosted by a different user"*.

[**Priority quests**](https://mappersguild.com/missions) take that a step further, offering more complex objectives that aren't necessarily tied to one Featured Artist's music!

These new-style quests function differently from normal quests too. Here are the important differences:

- **Anyone can participate in priority quests.** Unlike normal quests, you don't need to claim priority quests in advance.
- **Quests are tiered by difficulty:**
  - Tier 1 ![bronze icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/bronze-small.png) (easiest, most common, and lowest reward)
  - Tier 2 ![silver icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/silver-small.png)
  - Tier 3 ![gold icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/gold-small.png)
  - Tier 4 ![platinum icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/platinum-small.png) (hardest, least common, and highest reward)
- Depending on the quest's completion conditions, **multiple users can earn prizes for the same quest**.
- **Priority quests don't last forever.** Maps can be added to priority quests until a deadline is met or a beatmap completes the quest.

Check out these new quests from the [**priority quest listing**](https://mappersguild.com/missions). It explains basically everything that we can't fit in this article!

### Priority quest rewards

As the name implies, these quests are a bit more special than ordinary quests, and we're offering some special rewards in turn!

To start, maps associated with priority quests earn bonus progress towards [Mappers' Guild profile badges](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#rewards). This is handled with a complicated point-based system, which you can read about [here](https://mappersguild.com) if you're really invested.

On top of that, anyone who completes a priority quest also receives a **customised keychain** based on a pattern in their winning beatmap!

Depending on your country, shipping this may be difficult or impossible. [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) (the dude writing this article) will be creating and shipping these individually, so don't expect the same efficiency as a professional production studio. :)

And on top of *all of that*, we're also offering a new profile badge to anyone who completes 3+ priority quests.

The [**priority quest listing**](https://mappersguild.com/missions) details more about prizes and will always have a few active quests running at any given time, so participate in whichever you're interested in!

## Ranked map requirement lifted

Previously, you needed **at least 3 Ranked maps** to host beatmaps and earn rewards in the Mappers' Guild. Those days are over.

As of this change, **anyone can participate in the Mappers' Guild**!

This includes:

- Linking your Featured Artist beatmaps to the [Mappers' Guild map list](https://mappersguild.com/beatmaps) to track reward progress
- Collaborating in [quests](https://mappersguild.com/quests)
- Submitting maps to new [priority quests](https://mappersguild.com/missions)

If you're a newer mapper looking to get started with the Mappers' Guild, feel free to ask questions in the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy)'s `#mappers-guild` channel!

## Smaller changes

Most changes to the Mappers' Guild aren't too glamorous. Here's a few highlights from the past year:

### Beatmap Nominator modding points

Up until now, modders would earn 1 [Mappers' Guild point](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#rewards) for each map they mod.

Some [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) have requested their points for modding to scale according to beatmap length, since anyone who nominates a beatmap is guaranteed to have modded the full mapset.

That said, anyone who nominated a Mappers' Guild beatmap has earned points relative to their modding efforts. This includes cases when a user forgot to add themselves as a modder too!

### Notifications and invites removed

Anyone who engaged with the Mappers' Guild before could tell you that these were annoying. So now they're gone.

### Automatic quest dropping

It's no secret that a lot of [quests](https://mappersguild.com/quests) are inactive. There's no major penalty for this, but to give other users a chance, any quest that is inactive for a year is dropped and made available to the public.

### Party leader can compensate points for other users

To claim certain [quests](https://mappersguild.com/quests), each party member would need to spend some points. Some users have 0 available points though, so they can't take quests.

Instead of completely locking users out of quests, the party leader can now compensate for another user's lack of points by spending more of their own points.

## Major contributors

A ton of people are involved in the **Mappers' Guild**, but some stand out above the crowd. Below are some of the top contributors to the guild! (More specifically, this is anyone who's contributed 10+ difficulties to Ranked Featured Artist maps since last July... and [SMOKELIND](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9327302), who focused on total Ranked maps instead.)

While these folks may be in the spotlight, there's a lot of other people in the [**Mappers' Guild**](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild) who contribute too. If you're one of them, thanks for the help!
