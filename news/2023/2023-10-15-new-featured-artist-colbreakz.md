EDM legend **ColBreakz** drops into our Featured Artist catalogue!

More than a decade has passed since **ColBreakz** started experimenting with electronic music, so it's about time he's officially part of osu!.

Any osu! player with a background in *Geometry Dash* may have heard **ColBreakz** through *10.000* — a tune that's been a staple in that community since 2016. While **ColBreakz** doesn't have an extensive history on osu! yet, we're sure his iconic style will make that change VERY soon.

**18** of those iconic songs are now part of [**ColBreakz**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/384)!

Begin your mapping session with a bit of inspiration. Here's [ColBreakz & Vizzen - Remember](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2052201) mapped by [Hinsvar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1249323) showcasing how osu!(lazer) handles rate-changing mods, followed by a bunch of other song previews:
