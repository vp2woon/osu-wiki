Renovations are complete. The newest branch of our Featured Artist library, **Aice room**, is ready for visitors!

Perhaps better known as **Nor** through his work on the *Blue Archive* OST, **Aice room** is a highly acclaimed composer/producer who you might've heard without even knowing it. Outside of his self-released music, he's composed and remixed tracks for the anime *Kaguya-sama: Love is War!*, VTubers like *Kizuna Ai* and members of *NIJISANJI*, and a whole heap of other cool stuff.

**Aice room**'s solo works are primarily what he calls "dreamy music", and we have **11** of them available for mapping. Wander on over to [**Aice room / Nor**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/360) for the full list.

And in case you need some inspiration before mapping, take a peek at this rendition of [*DREAMY PLANET*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1624046) below, then listen to a few other previews:

As per usual, [**Aice room / Nor**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/360) has a bunch more songs to choose from, all available as pre-timed beatmap templates. That'll shave a whole 30 seconds from your upcoming 9-hour mapping project. You're welcome.

In other news, we'll be releasing **2** new Featured Artists next week!

You'll understand why later, but for now, stay on top of everything through the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) or the `#featured-artists` channel in the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy).

See you soon.
