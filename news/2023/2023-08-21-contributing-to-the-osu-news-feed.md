Looking for news? We're looking too!

Let's talk about the thing you're reading this very moment. If you're new to the game, welcome! These are semiregular posts highlighting news about osu!, including updates, events, contests, showcases and more.

They are written mostly by members of the [osu! team](/wiki/People/osu!_team), but you may have noticed a sizeable portion authored by none other than people like you:

Needless to say, [concerns](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/issues/2433) have been [echoed](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/issues/7685) about how much space the [Featured Artist initiative](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) has taken up on the news feed, even though the growth has been exciting. While the onboarding of artists has [slowed down since the end of March](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-03-25-new-featured-artist-ashrount#featured-artist-release-schedule-update), we could still do better in breaking up the monotony.

Last year, there was a [call to the community](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1605337) to spice up the front page with more variety, which led up to [osu!monthly](/wiki/Community/osu!monthly) making a comeback for its [3rd season](/wiki/Community/osu!monthly#season-3-(2022–2023)) (in news post form instead of forum posts) and a few interesting news articles here and there, but we want to spread the word further and make contributing more accessible to the community.

Are you interested in creative writing and want to share it with the player base, or just have an idea that you would like to see covered on the front page? Then feel free to read on below!

## Suggesting ideas

If you have an idea that you think would be a good fit for the front page, you can now submit them via this anonymous [suggestion box](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeuv9heFjBX_NPDzpMvV2ORaNllHtzWKRDmk5IqSMEWvc-SNw/viewform)! Once submitted, the responses will be reviewed and promising ideas will be put up for anyone to take up and write in the `#osu-news` channel of the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy).

In theory, anything could go in that box, but let's outline a few potential candidates to draw from:

- Tournaments
- Contests
- IRL events
- Large mapping projects
- People to interview (other than peppy)
- A piece of osu! history
- Topics to spark community-wide discussion around
- Anything niche but interesting or of general community interest

Of course, you may also get in touch directly via Discord.

## Writing for the front page

If you are keen on sharing your writing with the community, the process is incredibly simple!

The `#osu-news` channel of the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy) is the place to reach out about anything news-related. If you just have an itch to write but don't have something specific in mind, there is a pinned list in `#osu-news` with news topics that you can freely pick up. Just make sure to give a heads-up, so people know what's already being worked on.

The only prerequisite is that you should be comfortable with constructive criticism and editorial feedback (and be fairly confident in writing)! While review takes place on GitHub, having an account is not required. Take a look at the [news styling criteria](/wiki/News_styling_criteria) to get started.

## Tournaments

Tournaments are of specific interest regarding news coverage, which has been lacking in terms of making people aware of not only their on-goings, but also their conclusions.

Tournament hosts wishing to advertise on the front page should email the [tournament committee](/wiki/People/Tournament_Committee) via [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto:tournaments@ppy.sh), who will review its suitability for the front page along with the news team. The specific requirements are still being worked on, but will be published on [this wiki page](/wiki/Tournaments/Official_support). (Bookmark [this forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1715676) for updates on that.)

If you're not a host but know of a tournament that you think should be featured, the [suggestion box](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeuv9heFjBX_NPDzpMvV2ORaNllHtzWKRDmk5IqSMEWvc-SNw/viewform) mentioned above is the place to send it.

Naturally, we're also looking to give the World Cups more coverage as well. If you're interested in writing for those, feel free to take up the task!
