Summer's around the corner, and Project Loved is sure to bring some much-needed sunshine into your life!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

To those who're still unfamiliar with what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As always, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the April votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

For those of you out there who love aim control, this week's *Popular Playcount* pick is surely one you don't want to miss!

Coming in at over 100,000 plays and sitting at nearly 8\*, [Ayase Rie - Hijitsuzaikei Joshitachi wa Dou Surya Ii Desu ka?](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/973976#osu/2186894) mapped by [Delis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1603923) is a relentless beast that only the best of the best will be able to conquer. Full of awkward flow aim, speedy back and forths and insane spacing, this map is going to test you to your absolute limit. Don't miss, or you might find your run will swiftly come to an end!

If you'd like to see this map in the Loved category and prove your skills against the world, make sure you vote yes!

The *Outstanding Oldies* pick for this May is... [Felt - Protagonists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/58666#osu) by the legend himself, [Rue](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/417551)!

Teaming up with [semaphore](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6313643) for this badass monster of a mapset, Rue has mapped this way-underrated gem. Dating back to 2012, this banger goes *way* back. Offering with the slickest and cleanest gameplay experience one can ask for, this map is just nothing but heat all around — and I think describing the map this way would be underselling it, if anything. One thing you gotta do, is *you gotta listen and give it to 'em*. Try the map, and you'll see what I'm spitting — which is nothing but facts!

This month's *Small Spectacles* pick will be Feryquitous' [Akzeriyyuth](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1504481#osu/3082062), mapped by [Celine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3545579)!

Initially mapped for Corsace Closed in 2021, Celine has created one monster of a *No Mod Three*, deceptively sitting at 8.04\*. Blasting mischievous patterns on full blast, this map feels like a boss fight on its own. Filled with nonstop intensity of alternating patterns, hard-hitting sliders, and puzzling overlaps, this map shows no mercy at all and I freaking love it for that. After all, the song title means "cruelty", so it would be a shame not to go ham on this one, right?

*description written by [Skill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7802027)*

The *Daredevil Difficulty* for this month is [nhlx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3827077)'s take on bibuko's [Izayoi Girls Rage](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/558091#osu).

At an exceptional 10.31\*, this map tests your raw mechanical skill to the limit. This has it all: full-screen jumps, 256 BPM spaced streams and bursts, unconventional sliders and just a plethora of mechanically difficult patterns. Unlike most 10\* maps you see today, this map is consistently difficult for a length of 3 minutes and 41 seconds. There's no letting up, making this map a true display of skill.

Formerly known as deetz, diodex and friends have made one hit of a mapset of this bouncy tune by subeteanatanoseidesu., and with his unmistaken finesse, diodex has done it once again. Playing this map feels like you're actually dancing with the groove of the song, as if the playfield were a disco floor all yours to go crazy on. Personally, my cursor has been dancing to this map for a long while, and I can't wait to share the same joy with you guys! Come vote and get down!

This month's *Gameplay Gimmicks* pick is... [MilhioreF](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/941094)'s TAG4 map, [Yakumo  >>JOINT STRUGGLE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/295458#osu/663776)! That's right baby, the year is 2023 and I'm bringing back TAG4 maps! Why? Because I said so! And you can't stop me!

Made infamous by the original DJPop mapset from 2010, this song is a familiar one for a lot of you. In true fashion of DJPop's maps, MilhioreF made a TAG4 homage which is 10 times more chaotic than the original, simply "because DJPop forgot to make one". [As one Norwegian champion claimed before: it's *Utage wa Eien ni* 2.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5oXPc8a9ds), so you can imagine how that plays out. I don't think there's a lot to describe here, really — it's crazy, it's 10 stars, it's TAG4, and it's simply just some old Touhou mapset goodness. Need I say more?

These two plunderphonic songs from Wobbly bring more chaos and confusion than most are ready for, but [dsco](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4330511) is just insane enough to bring order to this madness. Sitting at a sly 6.26 star rating, [Yo Yo Yo Yoyo Yo, Hey... / Uhh, Hey Eh. Check It Check It](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1689255#osu/3452047) is a beautifully expressive map that's here to make you doubt everything you knew about music and rhythm.

Let's take a trip back to 2016 with this month's *Second Shot*, [KINGS OF THE CITY - Wrong (Muzzy Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/414582#osu/898654) mapped by [Hikaru Rose](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4811275)! Narrowly missing the threshold by 3.42% back when it was nominated in 2018, I feel like this banger deserves another chance.

Sitting at a comfortable 6.25\*, this almost 7-minute map is full of neatly structured jumps, tricky streams, and just about everything else that defines mapping in 2016. Your consistency will definitely be tested on this one.

If you'd like to give this map a second shot at Loved, make sure you vote!

Grand Escape is a beautiful song from the movie *Weathering With You* that captures the emotions of the listener with its sweeping melodies and heartfelt lyrics, and [Gero](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1467715), [Amamiya Ren](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7025804), [Hey lululu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4086497), [Deca](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9088487) and [Monstrata](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2706438) have all done a fantastic job of translating that feeling into pure hit circles and sliders for us.

Peaking at just 4.76\* in its hardest difficulty, this stunning mapset can be fully enjoyed by any player, so feel free to give it a try. It's sure to become one of your favorites in no time!

This month's first *Wildcard* is a bit of a cover, with this *Ranked Reject* in disguise finding its way in.

If you were around during the early days in January of 2021, you may have a clue to this map's reputation. **HOWEVER!** Here in Loved, I believe it may find redemption with this full set of [Will Stetson's *Super Driver*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1334617#osu/2793431) cover, playing an integral part of the gimmick in this set. Mapped specifically to a unique beat of Will Stetson's cover, the Extra difficulty provides a unique CS 7 aim control experience found nowhere else.

Throw away your prior convictions and give this map a chance at the redemption it deserves!

In the age of fancy maps with crazy techniques, it might be important go look back a bit and just play something simple and fun, which this map achieves perfectly.

Infamous for the insane tech challenge it provides, I believe *Talk* deserves a spot in this month's Loved picks! Don't be fooled by the low OD, Talk is a real struggle to acc with its many creative snappings. Talk provides it all: bursts, techy snappings and many more for you to experience.

So what are you waiting for? I'm done talking... 🎤

Who says sequels are always worse? The second part of [LeaF - LeaF Style Super Shredder](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/179779#taiko/432725), by none other than [Kurokotei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/398275), is one of the hardest classics from 2015 (yes, contrary to what the submit date says, this is a reupload from a [2015 set](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/294455#taiko/662511) by [Cherry Blossom](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1156742)).

Combining highly technical patterns that require an incredible amount of focus and a decimating pace that forces you to have strong stamina, both of which were unusually high for its time and are just as insane nowadays!

This beatmap includes terrifying deathstreams combined with really long trills that are pretty difficult to hit or even survive, so even a pass is definitely a win on this map. Have fun!

Desuwa\~

A collab between two experienced mappers whose names are familiar in Loved, [rezi888](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2337821) and Shallty! While you may associate these mappers with their fun & challenging speed maps, this is a simpler yet engaging map at 4.8\* with various patterns including 1/6 and 1/3 snappings that will keep you on your toes.

For those looking for a challenge, this map can be enjoyed with various mods including DT which transforms this map into a speedier challenge that flows very well, so it is no surprise that this map is a popular classic among the community. Overall, it's a very fun map that players from various skill ranges can enjoy, desuwa\~

This month I introduce a very distinctive map by mapper [Shamirin_mzk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11325757), who has recently become so popular that he has been picked in the Loved poll many times.

This map appeared in EX1 of the Qualifiers of the [Taiko Suiji Cup 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1682568). Those of you who hear this song for the first time will expect it to be a very easy map, but that is not the case at all! The speed of this map is very slow, but the very difficult rhythm will make it extremely difficult to get an S rank or improve accuracy!

Let's have a coffee break together! ☕☕

Now, when you look at this map, you might think it is not even that old. However, this mapset was originally uploaded in 2015 with a Salad–Overdose spread. With the newly uploaded beatmap, two new difficulties have been added, giving it an even wider difficulty spread!

Pretty much everyone already knows both Daletto and CLSW, so you already know what you can expect from them.

Because of the full difficulty spread, ranging all the way from a Cup up to a Deluge, you are sure to find at least one of the difficulties suitable for yourself to play, whether you are just starting out or are a veteran of the game mode.

Give the map a go, try one of the six difficulties, and cast your vote!

This month, we go back in time quite a bit, with a pick from [CWC 2018](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2018#quarterfinals)'s Quarterfinals mappool.

It is a fairly classic [Crowley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6341006) map. Following his usual style around this difficulty, it is full of slider-based action and is overall a control-heavy map. Any player from the mid-range level can enjoy playing this!

Either way, if you liked playing this, go ahead and shoot a vote its way!

One of the most common associations people have with spring time is that nature recovers from the cold winter and everything blooms anew. What could be more fitting than a song that gives you a feeling of spring?

In this case, it is *Flower Dance* by DJ Okawari mapped by [RedcXca](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14056601). The map itself starts out rather simple and fairly easy to play. However, as it goes on, the difficulty of the map increases as well as the amount of far dashes and hyperdashes making it hard to keep your combo and not mess up. Some of the jumps and patterns are also a bit tricky as they require precise movement. Even though it is not an easy map, most experienced players should be able to pass the map without many issues.

Overall the map is good fun so make sure to check it out!

You don't hesitate to open the door of course, it's beautiful outside! Kindness shall be bestowed unto everyone on such a month! . . . But outside lurks a demon.

Upon you, lurks G e n g a o z o created by the warlord Realmas. They have arrived at your door with its May fury and they are not looking friendly.\
"Want to dance?" G e n g a o z o says with a rasp in his voice. You planned for this moment, you were taught for these dangers when you were younger.

You grab your keyboard and headset and fight the beast! As a "Neverending Nightmare", it unleashes plenty of wiggle spam over the course of your 2:58 duel. But beware, because it is an experienced fighter and has slain many newcomers along its way, coming in with a 8.06\* rating of expertise. They are TRICKY and do not let beginners succeed with such ease!! You don't want to mess with this month's beast of wiggles... or do you possess the indomitable will to conquer it?

So, you want to duel this David-and-Goliath-style? Vote away!

Congratulations to Sweden for winning [this year's edition of Eurovision](https://eurovision.tv/event/liverpool-2023)! This month, we are celebrating with a throwback to Getter Jaani's *Rockefeller Street*, Estonia's entry back in 2011 which set itself as a low-key public pleaser with a catchy tune.

[Logan636](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9423766) was a major driving force in tournament organization, spearheading many editions of the [4 Digit osu!mania World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM) among other tournaments. With the help of SV mapping veterans [HowToPlayLN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10879600) and [zero2snow](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7751516), this particular map was featured in its [second edition](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/2#group-stage) in the group stage, which is to say that despite belonging to the SV category, it is very affordable and accessible for newer players to try and learn.

The "Prosperity" difficulty allows non-SV beginners to enjoy a nice song without troubling themselves too much. "ProSinewaveViewingperity" takes a reading-oriented approach, with scrolling variations that will challenge your accuracy, but normalized spacing which makes it easy to reason about. "ProSubconsciousVisualizationperity" puts emphasis on memorizing the rhythm of the chorus, which is a reasonable entry point into memory-oriented SV maps.

We've had many, many challenging SV entries throughout this year: it's time to give new SV players a chance! Tell your friends, tell your family, and cast your vote!

This chart comes with your typical approach of his, which is expressive while also maintaining the technicality of what the song has to offer, with jumpstreams that come in with the chorus, and various snappings to the vocals. Among the past few years, this pick has been very popular in community tournaments and then some, thus garnering its popularity from players and charters alike!

There's absolutely not a whole lot to hate given Valedict himself has been considered a beloved brand from the VSRG community, and the exposure of this pick from [Valedumps 2](https://etternaonline.com/pack/61940) certainly catapults him to an even greater height.

We have seen a lot of anime charts being pushed into the Ranked section, so why don't we expand that to the Loved section as well? And this time, we have a familiar face from the VSRG community bringing just that — [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707)'s chart of [unravel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/463971#mania)!

The name and the chart itself speak for its popularity — it has proven to be one of the most popular conventional dump charts used as a scoring benchmark. Being nearly seven years old, it has been used and popularized even more in community tournaments to the point where we have probably lost count of how many there are. Furthermore, during that period, dump charts were relatively scarce, and there weren't many options available to test players' limitations outside of Shoegazer's other hard dump chart, [Camellia - Fastest Crash](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/428234#mania/924286).

We've been promoting newcomers to the Loved section for diversity for quite a while. Now, we are giving you the opportunity for song choice diversity, specifically focusing on anime this time around. So, would you like to see this chart being pushed through to the Loved section? Help us unravel that mystery by casting your vote now!

As we all know, chordjack is not a very mature type of gameplay, as it appeared much later than streams. So, it's no exaggeration to say that this pack which submitted in 2016 is a milestone in osu!mania.

Recent years, we've seen first-hand how many chordjack players have improved themselves and achieved so many insane scores. Then, how did today's players improve so quickly? The answer is the increasing number of practice resources.

Training hard every day to improve yourself, I believe it's not just my personal experience but every players'. This pack did help me a lot when I was a rookie. Just like the title of the pack, to train players for endurance and stability, [Staravia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5445777) has made the maps as smooth as possible and without any weird tricks to play around with. Staravia uses BPM for an intuitive indication of difficulty and the song choices shouldn't be hard to vibe with, making it all the better to practice with.

Trust me: if you're a player who wants to get into chordjack but don't know how to flick your wrist to make a cool beat, then this is the way to go. Don't forget to cast your vote if it helps!

You thought we were already spoiling you with Valedict and Shoegazer's picks, here's another all-time classic: [ilikexd](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2450614)'s chart of [WE EAT AT FIVE FIVE FIVE (guys)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1291582#mania)! Coming from [hi19hi19 Pack 3 - Popcorn Blast JS Buttery Snack Filez](https://etternaonline.com/pack/48), this is a short but intense, speedy rice experience.

Despite the song being quite memey in nature, ilikexd has continuously been known for providing high-quality rice charts for the *Etterna* and *Flash Flash Revolution* communities, a subset of which have been ported to osu! and some of them even ranked. *WE EAT AT FIVE FIVE FIVE (guys)* provides two difficulties with very misleading difficulty names if you are used to the ranking criteria standard. "Hard" already provides streams at close to 280 BPM, which is definitely not RC-compliant. The Insane only adds a bit more spice, meat, and density to the speed, which doesn't change all that much.

It might seem strange and jarring to go into such a line-up of mappers considering we have been trying to promote and include more charters from all over the world in Project Loved, but we genuinely like to change things up and try to make the experience interesting for everyone. Please tell us in the comments or in the voting threads how you feel about this strategy and how we've been doing so far, and don't forget to vote for your favorites!

*description written by [Paturages](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479)*

[DannyPX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11253722) makes a comeback in Project Loved with a huge LN banger: [BRING IT ON](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1239671#mania). First notably featured in the Grand Finals of the 3rd edition of the [4 Digit osu!mania World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/3#grand-finals), it has since also been brought back in the 3rd edition of the [osu!mania LN Tournament](/wiki/Tournaments/o!mLN/3) (albeit as a cut version, which is not going to be Loved). I guess third time really is the charm, huh.

DannyPX's late-game long notes define themselves as a mix of various technical traps at a physically challenging pace — *BRING IT ON* is a good exhibit of that. Players aiming for an S rank or an FC will have to struggle with incredibly demanding coordination and strain which doesn't give many breaks at all, whereas top players will find another challenge in aiming for top spots by maximizing accuracy, which given DannyPX's release mapping style, is a hard ask even at high proficiency.

Want to see this banger reach the Loved library? Come on, *bring it on*, cast your vote!

[Wilben_Chan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6659363) returns to Loved voting with [senya - Kimi to Dareka no Yasashisa ni](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/729871#mania). This map shares similarities with their previous Loved entry, [senya - Zouka de Arou to Shita Mono](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/781166#mania/1640684), and those similarities go beyond just the artist!

Indeed, this is a chordstream-based consistency pick, with small breaks and just a few LNs sprinkled in a couple of sections to accentuate the melody. The consistent patterning makes it a nice challenge at various skill levels, whether you're leveling up your chordstream skills or you're a master looking to test your accuracy. This may be the reason it was picked in the [MWC 7K 2019 Quarterfinals mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2019_7K#quarterfinals), where it gained popularity and was played in all matches except the one in which it was banned!

So, whether you're struggling to build finger independence or you can effortlessly combo through the patterns, before battling it out on the leaderboard, Wilben_Chan needs your vote!

[LostCool](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/766374) is back with [NIJISANJI - Virtual to LIVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1139542#mania)!

A version of the "Towards a Bright Tomorrow" difficulty was used as a mixed LN pick in the Finals round of the [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_7K). It features plenty of mixed dense chordstreams, inverse LNs, and various other patterns relentlessly thrown at you. While this set gained a boost in popularity from the previously mentioned tournament, the set has been around since 2020 with a steady rise in popularity since its upload.

If you need something easier to read, there is a Luminous difficulty that reduces the LN complexity significantly. It is a good practice chart for those who need to practice basic LN patterns.

With an impressive play count for its key count and skill set, we hope that you enjoy this set as much as many others have in the past.
