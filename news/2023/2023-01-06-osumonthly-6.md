Catch up with community happenings in December's edition of osu!monthly!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-01-01-osumonthly-6/banner.jpg)

Welcome to the 6th edition of osu!monthly! December surely was a busy month with a lot of community rumbles.

If you want to contribute, feel free to reach out! The osu!monthly project is organised in the osu!dev [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy). If you have suggestions you can also contact any one of the members that actively help out with osu!monthly, and if you want to check out all of the previous editions, have a look at the [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1614314?n=1).

It seems that the end of the year brings the end of many osu! community events, the major one being tournaments. For far too long has the tournament scene not received enough news coverage, with new additions in recent months, osu!monthly hopes this brings a favourable light on a part of the community that has been left in the dark.

We also prepared a special recap of what we believe are notable (or maybe even the best!) plays of each game mode for this year, but please bear in mind that the selections are subjective, and while everyone has a right to agree or disagree, please do not go out of your way to harrass the individuals behind the selections.

With that out of the way, let's see what happened in December!

## What's new in osu!(lazer)

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgXrhrFFClY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This month osu!(lazer) has received probably the most requested addition of all time, that being enabling performance points. You are now able to earn pp for all of your plays done in the new client, although currently it is being implemented via a [separate version of the osu! website](https://lazer.ppy.sh/home) with mixed rankings. When it comes to mod customisation, currently only some give pp as a balance pass has not yet occurred, so please bear that in mind when you give osu!(lazer) a try.
For full details we highly recommend watching the excellent video digest by [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418).

A really cool and also very requested feature that was implemented this month is file sharing between osu!(lazer) and osu!(stable) via [hard links](/wiki/Client/Release_stream/Lazer/File_storage#via-hard-links) for your beatmaps, meaning that now you will not have to effectively copy your entire beatmap library when installing the new client. If you are curious about this particular feature, you can watch that specific part of the update video [here](https://youtu.be/LgXrhrFFClY?t=249).

## Community recap

### Makeship osu! plushie collab

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/makeship-x-osu/header.jpg)

Have you ever dreamed of being able to cuddle or throw the osu! cookie, pippi, or the big and strong Taikonator 3000? Last month osu! collaborated with Makeship to create some extremely cute plushies.

With a [small teaser](https://twitter.com/osugame/status/1600560233885339649?s=20&t=jMBRjxsv69dr1-lM2JLICQ) on Twitter, and a subsequent [giveaway on Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/status/1601055681217384453) and [news post](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-12-10-makeship-x-osu-plushies) announcing the release of this collaboration, the osu! team has decided to bring iconic osu! figures to life in the form of limited-edition plushies.

Unfortunately, this campaign has already ended. If you pledged for a plushie during the limited time, you can expect it to be shipped at the end of March. See the [Makeship product pages](https://www.makeship.com/search?q=ppy) for more details.

### COE 2023 date reveal

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-01-01-osumonthly-6/COE2023-banner.jpg)

The dates have been announced for cavoe's osu! event (COE) 2023, one of the biggest (if not the biggest) osu! event!

The staff team has announced large changes on their [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/uqJNxpf), the largest of them being the event floor that will be 3 times bigger, presumably with more room for osu! and other activities. Hopefully you're as excited as we are to hear more information in the coming months!

It certainly feels nice to know that the event will be held unlike in 2020, where a lot of uncertainty was present due to both financial and pandemic-related issues, and we are excited to see what improvements we'll see this year!

### osu! Wrapped 2022

It's been a tradition on osu! for several years to show off your yearly stats through various tools to showcase improvement (or just to show off), and the tradition keeps going this year! [osu! Wrapped 2022](https://api.netamaru.id/osu/wrapped), a website created by [Netamaru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1830361) allows you to share your top 10 plays, your playcount and favourite mappers of the year in a single image.

So don't hesitate to try and show your friends how much you have improved this year, or how much better you are than them!

### osu! UTT Arena Tournament 2022

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-01-01-osumonthly-6/UTTArena-banner.jpg)

The French community came back in force once again last year with their osu! and osu!mania tournaments taking place at the [UTT Arena](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1661444?n=1). What made this tournament so special besides the fact that it was a LAN tournament was the way the maps were chosen. There were no bans as we are used to see, but a total of 51 maps (including 12 custom maps!) divided into skillsets, of which only once could be chosen for the duration of the tournament.

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Sr_KGgkvf8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

After several matches and an overwhelming victory in the final, [VROUM CV VITE](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7630971) and [CharleLee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10434787) came out on top. In addition, during this event, [Ekoro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/284905) even had the opportunity to show and share some of his wonderful gameplay.

If you are interested in the event VOD, feel free to have a look on the [osu!frlive Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/osufrlive).

### osu!mania LN Tournament 3

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-01-01-osumonthly-6/osu!mania-LNTournament-3.jpg)

Earlier this month, the third installation of the [osu!mania LN Tournament](/wiki/Tournaments/o!mLN/3) was concluded! For those unaware, the tournament hosted by [MashedPotato](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10494860), [Polytetral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8612061), and [_yosh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7157133) is currently the biggest, most well-known tournament centred around long notes. By the end of 2022 they concluded their biggest, most ambitious iteration, with quite the assortment of custom songs, charts, and well-tailored mappools for the enjoyment of players and viewers alike!

| Placing | Player |
| :-: | :-- |
| ![Gold crown](/wiki/shared/crown-gold.png "1st place") | ::{ flag=PH }:: Silhoueska Elze |
| ![Silver crown](/wiki/shared/crown-silver.png "2nd place") | ::{ flag=CZ }:: grillroasted |
| ![Bronze crown](/wiki/shared/crown-bronze.png "3rd place") | ::{ flag=BR }:: DemiFiendSMT |

For those who might've missed it, don't worry! The team broadcasted most, if not all matches on their [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/osumanialive). Even earlier matches were heavily contested by all players, including but is not limited to [the final, championship bout](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1671582562) between [Silhoueska Elze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895) and [grillroasted](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18271627), an 80-minute non-stop battle for the 1st place. Even a full-on ARG was made just to showcase [HowToPlayLN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10879600)'s [LNCryption](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1893946#mania/3902893) custom map and original song, as well as the rest of the team which played a huge part on all custom-made charts in the pools.

With that said, congratulations to everyone who participated in and helped with the project! If you're interested in joining future tournaments, please don't be afraid to join their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/SPQtt3s).

### Artist of the Year

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-01-01-osumonthly-6/dreamxiety-banner.jpg)

For the entire year, there has been only one holder for first place in the art contests, which is none other than [Dreamxiety](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233)!

Striking the osu! community with 4 amazing and professional-grade artworks for each of the osu! community fanart contests this year, it is without a doubt that her work captured not just the hearts of the osu! community but the very essence of what osu! means.

We all know art is subjective and each person has their opinions on the piece, yet when the artist wins first place in 4 different contests, it is hard to say that it is completely subjective. Dreamxiety creates her works with charm and detail that is found in those that truly love what they do, whether it be for the community, personal, or work-related reasons.

Maintaining the same consistency throughout the contests is nothing but paramount to their dedication, poise, and desire to further themself and the rest of the community.

However, contests don't mean anything unless there is a competition to be had — and competition there was. Even though Dreamxiety created beautiful artwork, it is not without the rest of the artists, whether they were veterans or completely new to the scene, that they could have shone so well. With each new contest, the artists constantly stepped up their work creating higher-quality, eye-catching works for the audience to view and admire.

If you haven't seen their work, maybe it's time to turn the `Seasonal backgrounds` option on in the game settings! For those who are interested in Dreamxiety's process of drawing the artwork, you can check it here below:

### Notable osu! plays of the year

What better way to start this year's recap than with one, if not the best score by [worst hr player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14106450)? An insane [FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4205034675) on [Nexta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/716079#osu/1902818) by Lapix, an extraordinary tech beatmap requiring a perfect mastery of aim and incredible consistency. They gave us an eyeful with this almost perfect score showing us the extent of his talent.

Now this is a play that you could not miss. After almost 5 years without a single FC, [\[Karcher\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11443437) was the first to impress us with a first, then a second [FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4209503586) only two days apart, on [Yomi yori Kikoyu, Koukoku no Tou to Honoo no Shoujo [Kyouaku]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/461744#osu/1031991). This second play of 9 minutes, during which Karcher keeps hitting all the streams at 220 BPM, can only be considered impressive for any osu! player. Not only did \[Karcher\] definitely prove to us that his stamina and consistency are incredible, but he got to claim a mind boggling $3,333 bounty!

How about moving on to a classic? [WhiteCat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101)'s 4x miss with HR on [Revolutionary Etude [Prestissimissimo]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/539300#osu/1142884) definitely falls under that category, a 10.36* map asking for extraordinary aim control with cross-screen jumps at 145 BPM, along with solid reading skill due to the higher approach rate caused by HR. A play that definitely contributed to reaffirming the fact that WhiteCat is one of the best when it comes to aim.

How can one summarise the plays of this year without talking about a score that got the **osu! pp world record** title, although only for 5 days. [aetrna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6447454)'s magnificent [HDDTHR FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4327635852) on [Ascension to Heaven [Death]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/34348#osu/111680) worth 1357 pp definitely proved that when it comes to speed, no one in the world can currently do it better than aetrna, showcasing amazing consistency on the map regardless of the fact that the streams were 300 BPM. Even though aetrna wasn't extremely active this year, they still managed to leave a great mark for this year.

And to finish this recap, a play made by someone you all know because he didn't stop impressing us all throughout this year with new plays, each one being more mind-boggling than the last. One of many fantastic plays by global rank #1 player [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902), his [1240x combo](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4342345523) on [AugoEidEs [oyasumi]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/346104#osu/764082) definitely not only shattered the minds of every single player, but has also single-handedly shattered the skill ceiling once more as they keep making plays that were thought to be impossible, possible.

You can view all of the plays listed in the playlist below:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLbY6YsbyBvHCxJkm5d4KKn5672r-5z3ir" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Notable osu!taiko plays of the year

Just like the osu! section, for this rendition, we decided to capture the 5 most outstanding osu!taiko plays of 2022.

Usually we only showcase osu!taiko-specific maps, but [Ney](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5991961)'s [immaculate play](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/taiko/176006178) on [The Forgotten [grumd]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/55560#taiko/169841), caught our attention and was one which was not easily forgotten. The score showcases some extreme 500 BPM monostreams that were perfected by Ney's unique playstyle. With the map itself being 3 minutes long with only a brief moment to rest, this definitely lives up to being a play of the year.

Ney wasn't the only one to have had a specific impact on the osu!taiko community. [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) does it again with their [HDHR SS](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/taiko/175189773) on [The Limit Does Not Exist [Limit Break]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/420395#taiko/1028158). Featuring blistering and unrelenting 280bpm streams, Grape_Tea seems to do the unsurmountable and brings the play up to the next level with HD and HR, a mod combo that is notorious for being unable to play with, let alone SS with.

A newcomer to osu!monthly: [Nurend](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9905079)'s [NC play](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/taiko/175579351) on [Central Nucleus [Hell Oni]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1825183#taiko/3745697), coming in at a whopping 9.7 stars, this map is nothing but a beast when paired with NC, featuring difficult 1/6 and 1/8 patterns that challenge even the pros. This score is made even more impressive with it being the first DT play on the map and with only 8 misses, it is no wonder why this is being showcased.

One of the most showcased players for the osu!taiko section, [shinchikuhome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3174184) returns! Though, not just in name, it is all through merit on their exhausting [DT FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/taiko/174662507) on [Yomi yori Kikoyu, Koukoku no Tou to Honoo no Shoujo [Reverberation]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1819997#taiko/3734552). Mixing 330 BPM streams with the best player in the world tends to give an explosive performance. This 5-minute behemoth of a map shows the needed finger control for the slower 1/3 sections and the insane speed needed for the intense streams that the number 1 global needs to master to defeat this monster.

For the most voted play of the year, it was decided that [applerss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/983349/taiko)' insane [FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/taiko/175098621) of [Scattered Faith [Oni]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/812539#taiko/1704294). I mean, what else is there to say about this score? *Scattered Faith* is infamous in the osu!taiko community for being one of, if not the fastest map currently ranked. Coming in at over 8 minutes in length, and reaching up to 360 BPM, this play is definitely deserving of its #1 finish.

You can view all of the plays listed in the playlist below:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLbY6YsbyBvHBnVWWAfpMe31kx6b95GaAa" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Notable osu!catch plays of the year

Starting off the list, we find [Motion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3885626)'s [2x miss play](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/fruits/210787391) of [Hug and Kill [FRENZY 1.1x (198bpm) AR10 OD10]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1687036#fruits/3447887), a map infamous for the insane speed sections that very few players can even pass. Nevertheless, Motion shreds through the whole the speed section and almost clutches the FC, however even with his 2 misses he beat the previous best miss count by 20.

Next up we have Motion's [4x miss play](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/fruits/210576459) on [XHRONOXAPSULE [ROCMA'S XRONIXLE]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1715139#fruits/3504486), a map that currently sits as the ranked map with the highest star rating in osu!catch, coming in at 10.07 stars. The scariest and toughest part of this map is definitely the end section which features 277 BPM antiflow patterns. What makes this play so "special" is that he actually hit the hardest part of the map, a section that no other player had hit before, but failed at a previous, easier section, turning this play into a reverse choke. However, this isn't the play that sits in the leaderboard, since shortly after Motion would set yet another high score with better combo but 3 more misses, all located at the end of the map.

The [Shin dan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/884597#fruits/1872971) might just be the hardest map compilation in osu!catch history. After all, surviving through a 10.43-star map that lasts for almost 10 minutes doesn't seem like an easy feat. However, after a great community effort, [ArMa79](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4982799/fruits) claimed the first clear on this map, which in this context means obtaining a 99% on the map. This isn't the end of the story though, as only a couple months later, [Motion too would rise up to the challenge](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/fruits/210282357), sniping ArMa79's score in the process and setting one of the best plays of 2022.

[ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187)'s score on [Ded_ed](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/fruits/209875556) is probably the most unusual and shocking play set this year, but what makes this play so interesting? From an outside perspective, this map may just look like an easy 33-second, 3-star map, but this couldn't be further from the truth. This map features an astoundingly high CS of 7, combined with strange pixel patterns that requires immense precision that only become harder after applying HR. If this already sounds hard, wait until you hear that he did all of this while using Flashlight, absolute madness!

When a player as good as [YesMyDarknesss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4158549) takes over 2,000 attempts to FC a single map, you know they mean business. [This play on Palace of Melancholia](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/fruits/204815504) isn't just one of the best of this year, but one of the best HR scores ever performed. Every single section of this map is absolutely brutal, requiring immense catcher control and consistency. However, this is not the end of the story for YesMyDarknesss, as to this very day he's still trying to get another FC on this map, but this time with HDHR. Having invested yet another 1000 attempts on this quest, we wish him the best for this grind in 2023!

Lastly, this honourable mention is dedicated to what might be the worst choke in osu!catch history: Motion's play on the [World End difficulty of Sendan Life [World End.]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1431102#fruits/3881698) shows a level of speed and control that was thought to be impossible. Motion holds combo until the very end of the map, where a chain of unfortunate misses would set an end to what may have been one of the greatest scores of all time. Nevertheless, after a few more attempts, motion was able to submit an S rank on the map — far from the FC he wished for, but still a play worthy of a mention.

### Notable osu!mania plays of the year

It has been a wild year for mania players. A lot of astonishing accomplishments have been achieved all throughout 2022 across all keymodes! While we've shown you a glimpse of them on each osu!monthly news post, we'd like to recap the most groundbreaking scores of last year.

To start things off, we want to highlight [Doma - Umaru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10137852/mania)'s 6K performance across the year. Those with a keen eye might've seen them place first in many of the hardest 6K maps currently leaderboarded, such as these scores on [Leniane's chart of *Ragnarok*](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/mania/514011363) or [lemonguy's chart of *K.Y.A.F.A.*](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/mania/511013249) just to name a couple. But the cherry on top of the cake must be [this score on *Hachidaijigoku Jakontensei Kyousou Sanbika*](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/mania/498862818). This difficulty features an unrelenting volley of jacky chordstreams, and extremely punishing bursts and fast 203 BPM tech streams just to top it off.

Next one on the list is [Jakads](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/259972/mania), and their [amazing performance on aci's chart of *Rude Buster*](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/mania/479615854). The map needs little introduction, but it currently is the hardest non–sped up chart currently leaderboarded. This score remains the only S rank ever submitted to it! Honourable mention to [dressurf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/758406), who not only is [the runner up](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/mania/491815877) of the previously shown score, but also for their last year's [play on Evening's *PEACE BREAKER* x1.4](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/mania/466649715). Even after one year, it's still the only NM pass, and it's the only reason why this rate was Loved to begin with!

What about 4K? Well, as a community, lots of limits were pushed this year. But without a doubt, [bojii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083439) went above and beyond. They've managed to set astonishing records on mania's most ~~in~~famous charts! And while they've submitted godlike plays such as the [first-ever SS in lemonguy's chart of *Azure Arbitrator*](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/mania/492399052), their biggest achievement thus far must be [SS'ing Aruel's chart of *Blastix Riotz*](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/mania/490775286), one of the most well-known high-SR beatmaps ever ranked, let it be for its unforgiving layering, tricky motions, and arguably dated patterning. After 6 years, they were the first ones to ever submit an SS play to it, and we'd like to congratulate them for that!

Finally, we'd like to highlight [CrewK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11488604) as one of the best SV players the game has seen in the past couple of years. You can scroll over any SV map currently Loved or even Ranked, and I assure you you'll find them there. This year's highlight however is on [this FC on HowToPlayLN's chart of *polyriddim*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1182702#mania/2769068), specifically the play on the "brrrrrrrrrrrrrr vip" difficulty. To summarise, it's timing hell. A memory gauntlet to behold, only worsened by its unforgiving patterning. It's hard to put into words, so please, feel free to check out CrewK's awesome and unique full clear on the map!

## Mapping recap

All year long, the mappers and people involved in mapping on osu! have not stopped doing amazing things, and this month was no exception. So we will try to summarise all the things related to mapping that happened this month as best as possible in a few sentences.

### Mapping News

#### Relief of requirements to apply for BN

A big change has taken place in the application requirements of Beatmaps Nominators. Indeed, the notion of "ModScore" has been totally removed (which was a score based on the number of recent mods) from the required conditions evaluated during the application of future BNs. This change will hopefully bring a more accessible way for mappers and modders in the community to get involved in the ranking process.

#### Article on SEV rating added to the wiki

The way in which the BNs were judged could seem incomprehensible sometimes for the general public until very recently, because [SEV rating](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team/SEV_rating), the measurement system for nomination reset severity, is now explained in detail on the wiki.

### Mapping highlight

Although, like most osu! players, you may be content with the beatmaps already installed on your computer, new extraordinary and trendy beatmaps are released every month and receive the Ranked status. That's why we decided to add this new section to osu!monthly to keep you up to date with the most popular beatmaps among mappers, players and even music enthusiasts.

By the way, even if we don't mention all the beatmaps that have been ranked this month, you should know that they are all great, and worth a visit. Don't hesitate to take a look at the beatmap section of the osu! website and check out the most recent beatmaps!

#### Alakrity - Mighty Morphin Power Rangers mapped by Sytho - Community's favorite

An iconic song that recalls the childhood of many of us, [Alakrity - Mighty Morphin Power Rangers](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1758657) of the *Power Rangers* series and adapted as a beatmap on osu! by [Sytho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4175698) has definitely been the community's favourite, either as nostalgia throwback or another set to farm for those juicy performance points. With amazing guest difficulties made by [MakiDonalds](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11610772), [Kirishima-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9234078) and [rpoj](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17421591), this map has a good balance between streams and jumps, making it a pleasant to play, and players appreciated that as shown by its high number of plays, reaching 400k at the end of the month.

#### kessoku band - Seishun Complex mapped by \_kotachi\_ - Community's favorite

Another song that stood out this month is surely [kessoku band - Seishun Complex](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1863866) from the series *Bocchi the Rock!*, a manga recently adapted into anime. A song that the community liked a lot as shown in the "Popular Beatmaps" section of the home page in which this map has remained most of the month, thanks to [\_kotachi\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4698485) and all their GDers. We can also mention [kessoku band - Guitar to Kodoku to Aoi Hoshi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1880007) of the same anime but mapped by [ponbot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8939857) and their GDers, which was also very well received. Trendy song, loved by the community and mapped properly — a combo that works all the time.

#### twenty one pilots - Heathens (Magnetude Bootleg) mapped by funny - osu!monthly Mapping Team's favourite

It's a collab we've been waiting for a long time, and they sure didn't disappoint us! Some of the best tech mappers, including [0ppInOsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12551840), [-Doodle](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12337329), [enryotoki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10639122), [funny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8473573), [Halgoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4109923), [Rorupan L9](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9471638), [Sharu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5597639) and [Xarr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7262065), gathered around [twenty one pilots - Heathens (Magnetude Bootleg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1851103) to show us once again what they are capable of. With a lively and rhythmic song, wonderfully represented by complex yet organised sliders, and a storyboard that just adds another dimension to the map, this collab definitely caught our eye!

#### Various Artists - Song Compilation V mapped by Sotarks - Bonus

If you know a little bit about [Sotarks](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4452992), you should know that he sometimes makes songs compilations. He has recently launched his [Songs Compilation V](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1892585), but this time with a different theme, memes. With guest difficulties by [Akitoshi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4754771), [Elinor](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5419324), [Nymphe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10507407), [Pepekcz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7784933) and [Reform](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3723568), Sotarks has linked fun, thanks to the songs, and seriousness, through its always excellent mapping, in a set completed by a beautiful storyboard made by [PoNo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4610047) that accompanies us throughout this journey to remind us of the memes through time.

### Mapper Highlight

Obviously, behind each beatmap and difficulty on osu! is a mapper and hours of work to produce this "grouping of notes" that you play. So we wanted to highlight some of the mappers that stood out from the rest this month. Keep in mind that all the mappers are doing a great job even if we only select some of them, so you should definitely check out everyone's work!

#### DeviousPanda - Best Mapper

Who has never heard of them? A mapper who will never cease to impress us with his complex rhythms and his ever-so-beautiful and fluid patterns. [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334) has shown us this month once again what they are capable of with their two new Ranked maps: [Will Stetson - Kyu-kurarin](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1739478) and [Ekcle - Crafted In Ice](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1868244), two excellent maps as conceptual as the other and always as impressive. Whether you're a mapper looking for inspiration, or a player looking for a new challenge, it's definitely worth a visit!

#### Aurorance - Rising Stars

Their first map was ranked in August, but since then they have not stopped. With good quality beatmaps and cool song choices, including [Tarako - Bing Chilling-ish](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1820912) seemingly very appreciated by the community, staying in the Popular Beatmaps section all throughout November, [Aurorance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13142180) has definitely entered the big league. With their enjoyable but far-from-boring mapping, Aurorance has all the chances in the world to have a bright future!

#### melleganol - Rising Stars

[melleganol](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16452371) could be considered as a small mapper who ranks maps from time to time, until this December when four of their beatmaps came out of nowhere. It's with English pop or hip-hop music that they have completely created their own style and visuals matching really well to this kind of music. By utilising their uniqueness they created a map on [brakence - sauceintherough](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1885603), with a top difficulty that plays continuously with sliders and slider velocity to create an experience that is both fun to play and very visual, not to mention the custom hitsounds that complete this set so well. With such a mastered style, melleganol can only be on the right track!

### Mapping around the community

#### Community Mentorship Program

Ever since 2016, we see this wonderful [Community Mentorship Program](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1622724?n=1) run a couple of times every year, and it serves to help future mappers, modders and storyboarders to develop their talent with the help of people more experienced than them. Although the mentee applications should have closed since around the new year, we should see the spring cycle start very soon, so stay tuned for a future new spost if you want to participate in the project as a mentor or mentee!

#### Christmas Queue

For the past 11 years, the [Christmas Queue](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1687778?n=1) has been returning every year to rank beatmaps related to Christmas during this festive period, and this year is no exception! For those who don't know what it is, it's a modding queue that gathers a lot of mappers and modders (including BNs) from the community in order to make as many rankable beatmaps as possible with a Christmas theme — a good tradition that encourages mappers to celebrate the holiday!

#### keevy's Collab

This month on Twitter we saw [the announcement](https://twitter.com/keevyosu/status/1605231073620905986) of the end of a long project led by [keevy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10584295): a song compilation map of [Camellia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31)'s music! It is with the help of storyboarders, hitsounders, and nearly 50 mappers that this map could be created and offer to all players who try it a unique experience. It seems that keevy plans to organise other projects in the same style, so if you're interested in some mapping project, don't hesitate to [join their Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/BjWmtfAP)!

#### OMDB (osu! map database)

[OMDB (osu! map database)](https://omdb.nyahh.net/) is a new website created by [Apo11o](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9558549) in order to allow for all community members to freely express their opinions about any and all maps on osu!. Not only is it possible to rate individual maps from 1 to 5, anyone can leave a comment on them and express what the map means to them. The tool can also be used to find new beatmaps with various listing options such as random or latest maps, or just to look at the most recent submitted votes on the front page. This project is still in development but the reception received so far has been positive. In short, if you want an alternative way to find and judge maps, this may be your go-to place for that.

## Skinning Recap

Much to the dismay of skinners all around the globe, the Skinners' Bulletin was officially announced dead in late November of this year. However, after speaking to [RockRoller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8388854) we have agreed to include the recap in a smaller format as a part of osu!monthly, while still including the work of the [skinship](https://skinship.xyz/) team!

So without further ado, let's jump straight into it.

### Skinning news

#### New mixed skins subforum

The osu! skinning forums have disallowed mixed skins almost since their inception, which included removal of their threads. Around 2 years ago this was indirectly changed: mixed skins were still not allowed, but moderators were no longer allowed to remove offending posts. Only the original creators of elements used could file a DMCA claim to take down these offending posts, but few did. This has in turn caused a lot of bloat on the skinning forums, causing a huge drop in traffic as fully original skins were now harder to find.

About 2 months ago internal movements to improve skinning in osu! were started and the mixed skins quickly became a big topic in this. A new forum was created dedicated to mixed skins, now called **re**mixed skins, the [Remixed Skins](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/124) subforum. This new subforum allows for posting of said skins with the caviat that proper credits are required. Original creators are of course still able to make use of their rights and file DMCA claims if they have an issue with their elements being used in a skin.

One thing worth pointing out is that the rules for the other two subforums, [Completed Skins](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/109) and [Work In Progress](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/119) skins, have remained the same, so please do keep note of that when you are submitting your skin.

### Featured skins of the month

Of course we did not port only the news section of the Skinners' Bulletin, but also the beloved skins of the month section in which we will continue to feature 3 skins every month, although we have cut down on its length. So without further ado lets get into this months skins:

- [ALTITUDE](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1684016): This skin contains a nice mix of glowy minimalism and grunge aesthetics, with great use of techniques commonly seen in UI design.
- [io15](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1688412): This skin based around the Hololive VTuber Airani Iofifteen manages to show off its theme quite well, by heavily incorporating design elements of the character, truly making it feel like the skin is dedicated to the characters.
- [INGENIUM X](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1697586): A skin with a minimalist approach inspired by Ingenium from *My Hero Academia*, with bold shapes and gradients mimicking the heat levels seen on thermal cameras.

Check out a showcase of all of the skins below:

## Did you know?

Anyone's who remotely familiar with osu! is surely aware of [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)' and [ztrot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6347)'s collab of [Can't Defeat Airman](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/24313#osu/104229), one of osu!'s most played maps of all time. You might also know that there's [another *Can't Defeat Airman* map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/24084#osu/82033) by [Sushi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/43108), but did you know that they were originally supposed to be a part of the same beatmap?

That's right, originally the map by Mismagius and ztrot was supposed to be a guest difficulty on Sushi's beatmap. However, this didn't happen due to multiple reasons, some of them being that the map was considered too hard to be ranked at the time (so it would have to be [approved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category) instead), and Sushi feeling like the guest difficulty would overshadow his other difficulties.

Thanks to [Kurboh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15243233) for providing this cool fact. You can view the sources for the fact here: [1](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/43115?n=12), [2](/wiki/shared/news/2023-01-01-osumonthly-6/didyouknow-dec22.jpg).

## Monthly community quiz

Congratulations to [squidstain](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11073207) (as expected of an [osu!trivium](/wiki/Contests/osu!trivium_Quiz/2021) Champion) for being the first person to answer last month's question and score themselves 1 month of osu!supporter!

For anyone who missed last month's edition, the question was:

*"What turbulent seas does Bancho sail through in order to deliver your messages?"*

and the answer was: *cho.ppy.sh*. Get it, choppy as in turbulent? As terrible as this pun was, it was enough for squidstain to answer correctly and acquire themselves a free month of osu!supporter. A lot of you had very creative answers and we hope to see that level of creativity continues with this month's question, courtesy of our trivia master [chromb](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10238680) and one of the trivia champs themselves (and previous month's winner), squidstain:

**What class must mappers experience to create perfect sliders?**

When we showed this question to [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335) (the osu! community manager), they liked it so much both due to the difficulty and creativity, that they have decided to grace the first person to correctly answer with **3 months of osu!supporter**!

Same rules apply: you have exactly 1 month after this news post goes up (or until the next news post is up, depending on the timing) to provide a correct answer via a comment. If no correct answer is provided by that time we will reveal the answer in the next edition and the prize will no longer be claimable. Good luck!

## Things to look out for in January

- Yet another LAN tourney is on the horizon. Organised by [Zeus-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5464437) with the support of [Boğaziçi University Gaming Club (BUOK)](http://buok.boun.edu.tr/), the very first iteration of **Bosphorus Invitational** aims to gather around some of the best circle clickers within the Turkish community at the border of the magnificent Bosphorus strait where the continents meet, for an epic 1-day showdown of Turkey's best players. While the participation is invite-only, feel free to either visit the venue on the 29th or check out the tournament via the [BUOK Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/buoyunkulubu/) to keep the tabs on. See more details in the [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1696844), which is also [available in Turkish](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1696848)!
- For those of you who are *full Beatmap Nominators* and have an interest in being a part of the [NAT](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team), they are going to be doing some specific osu! BN evaluating where the full BNs are able to "play NAT for a bit" during January 1 – 31, 2023. If you are interested, you might want to talk to your local NAT representative.
- Qualifiers for the [osu!mania 7K World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-12-15-osu-mania-7k-world-cup-2023-registrations-now-open) are starting on the 8th of January, so be sure to tune in if you are a fan of top tier mania gameplay!
- During January and February the [4 Digit 4K MWC 2023 tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1671710?n=1) will be held, and while the gameplay might not be as top tier as the official World Cup, mania enjoyers might find themselves highly interested in this tournament as well.

## End word

As always, thank you for reading this month's edition of osu!monthly. We hope that 2022 treated you well and that the new year brings even more splendors. If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or want to contribute don't hesitate to say something in the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy). We thank you for the amazing response to osu!monthly during the last half of a year and we hope this continues on for many more years, it is with you all creating community content that this can even happen. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
