Things are progressing faster towards the goal of leaderboards by the end of the year, but so is the to-do list of getting there. Find out all about it in this video here or read the executive summary below:

### Changes

- **Velocity change visualisation toggle in the editor.** In osu!mania and osu!taiko, the speed of objects can be toggled to be constant or reflect gameplay.
- **New minimum -10 approach rate for the Difficulty Adjust mod.** Courtesy of reading expert [-GN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/895581), you may now attempt and fail something he does with ease.
- **Removed slider head movement.** No more misses when hitting a slider late. This was a consequence of the new slider "snake out" feature, but has now been fixed.
- **Beatmap attribute display in the mod select overlay.** Star rating, BPM, and other info can be seen on the left-side "details" tab, but when trying to select mods, a huge (albeit fabulous) overlay would rudely block the view. That is now fixed along with other quality-of-life improvements.
- **Missing beatmap download on replay import.** The game will present you with the correct beatmap (in a new *nano-sized* beatmap card) if you don't have the map for a replay your friend sent you. If you tick `Automatically download missing beatmaps` in the options, it'll skip this fancy presentation and just download the map automatically (which is still fancy).
- **Highlighted friend scores in gameplay leaderboards.** Your friends are pink, so you can easily tell when you're about to snipe their score.
- **Various spinner adjustments.** Calculations are now more like osu!(stable), which mainly affects the limit of how many bonus spins you can achieve.
- **Behind-the-scenes future design implementation.** Nothing important here. Do not look at the [changelog](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog/lazer/2023.924.0).

There's probably no need for me to tell you how to receive the latest update (it's automatic), but if you absolutely don't know, you can install the latest version [right here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/download).
