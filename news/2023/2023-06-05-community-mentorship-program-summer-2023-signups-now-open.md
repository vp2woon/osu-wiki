The 24th cycle of the Community Mentorship program is on its way! Get ready to delve deep into the world of mapping, modding, or storyboarding.

The Community Mentorship program serves as a place for upcoming mappers, modders, storyboarders, and even prospective mentors to develop their skills under the guidance of experienced members of the community. If you've ever found yourself wanting to expand your current knowledge, this might just be the opportunity you need.

Over the course of a cycle, you'll have the opportunity to learn from your mentor, participate in various mentorship events (like contests), hang out with fellow mentees, and more!

If you're experienced in mapping, modding, or storyboarding, and have a desire to take those who are new under your wing, then consider joining us as a mentor! In the [forum announcement and rule thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1772532), you'll be able to apply right away. If you're not sure whether you'll make the cut, we encourage you to apply anyway! You could be offered to participate in the Graduation Program as a Junior Mentor, where our most experienced mentors will teach you how to effectively mentor.

And if you're only just getting started and are eager to hone your skills, then signing up as a mentee might be what you need! In that case, be sure to mark your calendar for when the mentee applications open up. The timeline is as follows, all in UTC+0:

- Mentor signups will open on **June 5th** and close on **June 12th**.
- Mentee signups will open on **June 26th** and close on **July 3rd**.
- The 2023 Summer cycle will run from **July 4th** to **October 4th**.

Throughout this cycle, the organization team will host various events on the Mentorship Discord server, engaging and offering events for mentees and mentors to participate in. These include feedback lobbies, mapping contests, and more! Some of our previous mapping puzzles can be found here in [this thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/565382), and previous discussions can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/514122).

If any of this interests you or anyone you know, please go to our [forum announcement and rules thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1772532) for more information.

We're looking forward to the mappers, modders, storyboarders, and mentors of tomorrow!
