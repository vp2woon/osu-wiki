Mapping duos are finally ready to debut their masterpieces. Find your favourites and vote for them in the **Twin Trials beatmapping contest**!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/166/header.jpg)

The story so far:

- [A few months ago](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-02-01-twin-trials-contest-beatmapping-phase), we began the beatmapping phase of [**Twin Trials**](/wiki/Contests/Twin_Trials_Contest), a beatmapping + storyboarding contest where teams of 2 mappers created full difficulty spreads for some new [James Landino](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/39) tunes across **all game modes**.
- After submissions closed, [our mapping panels](/wiki/Contests/Twin_Trials_Contest#mapping-judge-panel) hyperanalysed every hit object on all **165 difficulties** to decide the best of the best beatmaps (which will be revealed after the voting phase ends!).

## Community Vote

Now it's your turn to choose the **community pick winner** and potentially earn a prize of your own!

Vote here:

- [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/166)
- [osu!taiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/167)
- [osu!catch](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/168)
- [osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/169)

...but before you can vote, you'll need to **play any of the Twin Trials playlists in osu!(lazer).** More specifically, you're required to play at least one difficulty from each mapset, and those plays can be spread across different playlists.

Access the playlists via the **play** menu on osu!(lazer) and filtering by **Featured Artists** in the top-right corner. There's one playlist for each difficulty level (Easy/Normal/Hard/Insane/Expert).

If osu!(lazer) is too *fancy* to navigate, this should help:

## Prizes

### Community pick

The top entries in each game mode will earn these prizes:

- **Community vote runner-up:** 2 months of osu!supporter
- **Community vote winner:** 4 months of osu!supporter + *Community Pick* profile badge

Going forward, we'll require that contests have at least 20 participants to earn profile badge prizes. We'll specify this next time, but bypass it in this contest for the sake of mappers who already poured their souls into these submissions.

### Twin Trials Champion

Players have a chance to earn prizes here too!

When the osu!(lazer) playlists close in two weeks, the players with the best scores in each playlist will receive these prizes:

- **Easy/Normal/Hard/Insane playlist leaders:** 1 month of osu!supporter each
- **Expert playlist leader:** 1 month of osu!supporter + *Twin Trials Champion* profile badge
