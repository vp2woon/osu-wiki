Melodic black/death metal band **WINTERHORDE** takes a step into our library of Featured Artists.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/337/header.jpg)

**WINTERHORDE**'s music is everything a metalhead could ask for: high-tempo, high-intensity, and abundantly dense with drums. Stream-focused metal mapping (which should really be called *blast beatmapping*) is their speciality, as made crystal clear by maps like [Chronic Death](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1699956) and [Worms of Soul](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1724057).

Wrench your mind around the **6** tracks we've picked up for [**WINTERHORDE**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/337), all pre-timed and ready for your `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `F` mastery.

Experience **WINTERHORDE**'s sound for yourself:

[**WINTERHORDE**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/337) has even more songs for you to smash your keyboard along to. Pick whichever suits your fancy and design your own finger-demolishing canvas of chaos (also known as a beatmap).

Our next Featured Artist might be a day late for... undisclosed reasons. Keep an eye on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for when it drops, and maybe watch this weekend's [MWC 7K](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_7K) for... similar undisclosed reasons.

Stay tuned.
