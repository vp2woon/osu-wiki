**you** did it!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/389/header.jpg)

And just to be clear, we're not talking about *you* (the person reading this). As talented as *you* may be, we're pretty confident that **you** (the Tokyo-based producer) is a better fit for our Featured Artists.

**you**'s goal is simple: "to create sounds that are fun to listen to".

While **you** is nearly impossible to find through a Google search, their style has already reached countless corners of the internet! From eSports organisations like *Crazy Raccoon* and *Yuki Aim* to TV shows, PC/mobile games, idols, VTubers, and (of course) other rhythm games, it's impossible to hide from **you**.

**10** tunes by **you** are available on [this Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/389), pre-timed and ready for... someone.

Curious how **you** would fit in a beatmap? Treat yourself to 4 of them by watching this osu!taiko-themed video or by playing the maps below!

You should head to [**you**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/389) where you can find beatmap templates for all of **you**'s tracks! If "you" still looks like a real word to you by now, then you clearly haven't read "you" enough times.

In case you forgot, there's a batch of [**Featured Artist playlists** in osu!(lazer)](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists) running right now! You have a week 'til score submission closes, so do what you have to do.

And of course, another artist is on the way next week! Stay tuned.
