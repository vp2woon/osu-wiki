**SWORD OF JUSTICE** slices their way through our Featured Artist library.

Spanning more than two decades, **SWORD OF JUSTICE** is a solo project launched by guitarist Toshinori Hiramatsu in 2002 and inspired by video game music from the 80's and 90's.

**SWORD OF JUSTICE** arrived in osu! during *2009* thanks to a simple beatmap of [Happy Birthday to You](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/9389), well before many of you may have even realised the game existed! Since then, their newer music has made it to the limelight through [Glacial Blaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1499138) and [Asmodeus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1452407)'s mapping machinations, forever cementing their place in osu!.

**7** modern classics are ready for mapping from [**SWORD OF JUSTICE**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/348)!

[**SWORD OF JUSTICE**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/348) has something you'd never expect: pre-timed beatmap templates for every new song. If you've ever wanted an alternative to begging your mapping friends to time your maps whenever you want to create one, we've got you covered.

And if you're looking for *even more music*, there's two more Featured Artist releases next week! We'll cover them over on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame), so use that knowledge however you'd like, and we'll see you soon.

Stay tuned.
