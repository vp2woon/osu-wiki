It's real. Welcome **t+pazolite** to our Featured Artists!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/396/header.jpg)

We'll give you a moment to process this, as anyone reading this is likely to have a reaction matching the preview point of [Call me it. (500 Tortures)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/291155).

...

Anyways.

**t+pazolite** has been mastering his craft since 2004, exploring any and every brand of electronic music, while simultaneously landing features in more rhythm games than a rhythm game historian could count.

Today, we're adding one more game to that list: **osu!**.

From [cheatreal](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/88180) to [chipscape](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/27752) to [TRICKL4SH 220](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/616696) to [Distorted Lovesong](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/81694), there's no shortage of classics that have come from **t+pazolite**'s genre-twisting discography.

A grand total of **57** tracks have been added to [**t+pazolite**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/396).

Yes, **FIFTY SEVEN**.

Here's a small taste of what that includes:

Your fingers must be tired after scrolling past all of those maps. If you're looking for a more condensed view of these songs (plus a bunch more), [**t+pazolite**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/396) is the place to be.

## Featured Artists in 2024

And with this release, we'll be closing out another year of Featured Artists!

While things slowed down this year after switching from twice-a-week to weekly artist reveals, we still brought **65** artists into our library in 2023!

osu!'s long-term goal with the Featured Artist program has been to bring talent (and their music) to the osu! audience, especially focusing on songs that have history in the osu! community and ensuring they can stick around forever.

We'll continue doing that of course, but throughout the coming year, we also want to bring attention to two other areas:

- **The continuation of our World Cups' [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals)**, which have already received a ton of attention in 2023 already thanks to [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718)
- **Artists who aren't well established on osu!.** Our backlog is already packed with smaller artists who are excited to make their osu! debuts, so stay tuned for a new year of even newer Featured Artists!

Thanks for supporting another year of awesome music in osu!. :)
