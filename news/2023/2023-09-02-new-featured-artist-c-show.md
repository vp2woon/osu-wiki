osu!'s red carpet unrolls for **C-Show**, our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/378/header.jpg)

You'd be hard-pressed to find an osu! player who doesn't know who **C-Show** is already.

With beatmaps ranging from [WorkaHolic](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/77441) back in 2014 to [AImee](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2044626) less than a week ago, **C-Show** has been around osu! for a *long* time. That, paired with their involvement in other games like *SOUND VOLTEX* and *beatmania*, has made them an undeniable staple in the rhythm game scene!

**23** of **C-Show**'s hardcore-focused discography are officially part of osu!, all of available from [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/378)!
