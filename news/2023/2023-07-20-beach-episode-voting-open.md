It wouldn't be a beach episode if we didn't lead with: IT'S THE SEA! And now it's time for us to *see* what you'll cast your votes for!

With **140** sizzling summer entries to smoulder over, it's official — the artists of the osu! community *really* like the beach. And now they've served us a serious challenge in figuring out how to spend only **15** votes on them.

Don't take our word for it though, see for yourself in this spectacularly summery slideshow summoned forth by the one and only Mr. Fat (pishifat) to an *incredibly* fitting tune known as *V!rtuaresort* by our very own Featured Artist, [seatrus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/185):

[**Click here to go straight to the voting for the Beach Episode Art Contest!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/179)

As always, the voting will only be open for **7 days** from this date, very neatly ending on the 27th of July. What could this date possibly mean? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Why are you even asking? There's definitely not going to be a *special* reveal and some new stuff or anything.

A selection from the top-voted entries will make it into the main menu as the Beach Episode seasonal backgrounds, and their creators will nab themselves a refreshing 3 months of osu!supporter for their hard work.

Additionally, the top 3 voted entries will get a unique profile badge created from their own artwork, so that they can relieve the summer of 2023 on their profiles until the heat death of the universe. Now *that's* a prize.

A big thanks to everyone who sent in entries — we didn't even have to disqualify that many of them! ...which is no small feat given the contest theme invariably involves swimsuits. We're proud of you.

Buckle up for the rest of the week, and maybe keep your eyes and ears peeled for what's approaching on the horizon... but make sure you vote first.
