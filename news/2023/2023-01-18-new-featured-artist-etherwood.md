Our Featured Artist library has a new monument: **Etherwood**.

If a new song by **Etherwood** drops in a forest and nobody is there to hear it, does it make a sound?

Obviously yes, there's someone hiding in every forest patiently waiting to hear **Etherwood**'s music. This English drum & bass producer + singer/songwriter has been topping charts for a full decade, and now they're officially part of osu!'s Featured Artists.

**5** of their tunes are up for grabs from [**Etherwood**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/335), including the 2015 classic [Cast Away](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/368466)!
