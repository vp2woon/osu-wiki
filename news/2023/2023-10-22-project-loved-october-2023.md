Surrender to the spirits of Halloween with some spooky Loved picks! 👻🎃

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

Welcome or welcome back to another edition of Project Loved! For those who are unaware of who we are and what we do, Project Loved hosts monthly community voting polls to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As we usually do, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the September votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

Last month marked six years of the community voting system currently in place. However, the Loved category existed even before the voting stage came to fruition. Beatmaps were first moved to the Loved category in October 2016. This makes this month the 7th anniversary of the Loved category existing as a whole! This is not the only milestone, however. Due to how Project Loved used to run weekly nominations for smaller waves, this is also the 100th iteration of voting! Loved has come a long way since then, and we are eager to see what it brings to the table for another seven years.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-10-22-project-loved-october-2023/medal.png)

We are also proud to announce a new addition to our set of Project Loved medals! This new set covers beatmaps that were featured during the Summer season for 2023. As a reminder of what these are, these are medals you obtain after playing through the beatmap packs present in the [Loved category of the beatmap packs page](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=loved). Once again, we express our sincerest gratitude to [Tanza3D](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10379965) for making the most eye-catching badges, medals, and other graphics for Loved! They have absolutely not gone unnoticed.

Each pack consists of a curated selection of beatmaps that were added to Loved in a given season. Your continued feedback is important to allowing these new medal releases to continue, so feel free to leave your opinions on those in the comments below!

The *Popular Playcount* pick for this month is [Sytho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4175698)'s map of [Katy Perry - Hot N Cold](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1245673#osu).

Sytho strikes again with another jump map up for Project Loved voting, this being one of his most popular ones to date. At a staggering 770,000+ plays and 400+ favorites there is no doubt that this deserves a chance in Project Loved. 4 high difficulties ranging from **7.27★** all the way up to **9.59★**, mostly for the higher end of players. If you've enjoyed maps like *Altar* or *It's Raining Men*, then this is definitely the map for you.

Let's see the best of the best aim players compete on this map and see who's really *Hot* or *Cold* on their aim.

Because what's a Project Loved round without it's monthly *tehc slideaux maps*, am I right? Essentially, pioneering and influencing the tech scene in his time, Ameth Rianno is an prodigy of sorts — your favorite mapper's favorite mapper, really. He went all in on this map capturing the chaotic nature of the song with the weapon he wields best: high-SV sliders. My words are failing me here, but one thing I'm sure of: *this map is Peak™*. An ode to Indonesian kids playing fireworks in front of your house — I suppose — as said by Ameth himself.

This map reminds me of a rap cypher. You get the idea — mappers riffing together in one circle cooking up 🔥 heat 🔥. I suppose you don't need\
an introduction to this one; the names of the mappers speak for themselves. High-SV sliders, going corner to corner, on a banger of a song. Need I say more?

This time, we bring yet again another engaging and high-quality map from them, in the form of [Neko Hacker - Aimai Cyborg (feat. Ugokuchan & JungMato)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1343645#taiko/2782966). While at first glance it's a speed+consistency map, it also tests a skill that has been rising on the tournament scene for the past few years: slow scroll/SV reading. Featured in a big tournament like TWC, it has kept being quite popular among the community, and it's our job to give this map an opportunity to go even further.

Now, it's up to you. Make sure to give it one, two, or even a hundred tries if you haven't already though!

Prepare yourself to face the biggest challenge, pencil and katagiri's [you love this track (hello, otaku)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1778216), a map that's been rising in popularity since back in early 2022.

Don't be fooled by the innocent title: this map is not for the faint of heart. With an outstanding 5 full minutes of high BPM, it demands a very high level of skill.

If you're a player who loves a speed/stamina challenge, I highly recommend you to check it out if you have not yet, and make sure to cast your vote!

[NOMA - SATELLITE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1988787) is a tech map consisting mainly of 1/4+1/6 rhythms and was the assigned map for [Advanced Global Taiko Showdown 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1761649?n=1) Week 3 NM4.

[Tomoya Ohtani - Bomb Rush Blush Remix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1098787#taiko/2295642) is a 175 BPM unconventional tech challenge from mapping legend [tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767), notably also being the first map of the [17th Taiko Dan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1098825#taiko/2295719). *Bomb Rush Blush Remix* derives its difficulty from the variety of patterning, featuring a mixture of common and fairly unusual 1/6 patterns, with the majority of these being in long and dense streams. With several of those 1/6 patterns needing to be hit in short succession, this is an excellent map to practise various types of 1/6 patterning you wouldn't typically see and is a very fun challenge!

We are back once again, with what feels like the monthly reading-focused pick at this point.

[Deif](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/318565)'s [Sore ike! Halycon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1463986#fruits) is known for having been made as a HD2 pick in [CWC 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2021)'s Semifinals. It is already AR 8, which is dreadful by itself on Hidden, but add a constant barrage of triples and stacks at the weirdest angles to that, and you get yourself a beautiful formula for suffering.

You can give it a try yourself; even without any mods, it is quite hard. But if you feel like that isn't enough, you can still give it a try with mods like HD or even DT!

Nonetheless, best of luck.

We are continuing this month's pick with a newcomer to the Loved section this month, being [Mniam](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6050530)! That said, they're definitely not a newcomer to mapping, with 25 Ranked maps under their belt.

We're definitely far from rankable maps here though, with this map being a nonstop attack of 3 minutes of anti-meta patterning. Awkward spacings? Awkward sliders? Awkward streams? Whatever you may think of that is weird, this map has it.

There's a reason that a version of this same map with the higher AR of 9.1 was already considered hard enough to be in the [Catch Nightmare Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1526012?n=1)'s Hidden Qualifiers pool, but now it's here to make you suffer just as much as then, and with AR 8.9.

Good luck taming this beast of a map.

[Razor Sharp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3414261) is coming back into Loved with one of his classic hyperwalk maps, [FLOWER](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/779608#fruits)! Similar to his other maps, such as *Beta*, *Sound Chimera*, and *Arche*, this map features a dense hyperwalk section with multiple different snaps and left-rights. This map is one of the easier entries to his hyperwalk Loved series, so this one could be great for players that are trying to get into heavier movement-based hyperwalk sections. Best of luck to everyone!

Are you in need of something new? Something that is fairly unique and gives you a different kind of challenge? Then maybe this map is for you!

If you start playing it and you think you are lagging then do not worry, it is completely normal. The map uses a special skin and storyboard that enable some gimmicks that would not be possible elsewhere, but I don't want to spoil too much, as it is pretty cool to experience firsthand. As for the map itself, it is definitely not an easy map and it has some tricky sections, but most of it is pretty straightforward. It has a stream section and a hyperwalk section in the second half of the map which might kill you if you mess up, so beware of that!

Make sure to have everything enabled when playing this map to ensure the full experience!

After a streak of very challenging SV Loved entries, we are introducing a break in difficulty with an all-time early-game tournament classic: [Mestro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4798263)'s [Main Heroine](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1356641#mania/2807631)!

Mestro has been a long-standing name in the tournament staffing community. They're not as active today as they were before, but they were among the main people who brought me into the tournament staffing rabbit hole a few years ago. I'm sure many seasoned people can attest to their contributions across many tournaments over the past years.

*Main Heroine* was one of Mestro's first endeavors in SV mapping and was historically included in the group stage of the [4 Digit osu!mania World Cup 3](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/3) and reused in many other following tournaments as an early game entry. As someone versed in the lower end of osu!mania difficulty, Mestro provided us with this cute, short and pretty straightforward SV treat. *Main Heroine* is an excellent introduction to the entire SV skillset, easing players into dealing with mild stutters and slowjams in the ending.

It's not that easy to recommend maps to newer SV players without overwhelming them with maps that are too hard and unapproachable, so we hope that *Main Heroine's* inclusion in the Loved beatmap library will help them in that regard. With more and more high-quality maps being available, now is a really comfortable time to learn SV! Are you ready to dive in? Go ahead and vote in the thread!

Making their way into the Loved nominations, [Blessia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6967285) potentially makes it in through one of their potentially most difficult beatmaps: [The Blue Sanctuary](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1637455#mania/3341785)!

[Blessia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6967285)'s maps typically involve challenges related to rice in general. This beatmap is certainly no exception, as being a 6-minute map *(and mind you, the CUT version!)*, you are certainly being tested here with your ability to play really fast dumpstreams, while still being able to maintain your stamina all throughout the beatmap. Six minutes is no joke, especially considering the fatigue that all of those patterns will bring you, with the mere fact that you get only a few break sections throughout this map.

If 1.0 is way too fast for you, there are a couple of lower rates added with 0.9 and 0.95; however, this also extends up to 1.1 if you're able to extend your capabilities to match a much faster rate.

Do you have what it takes to be able to surpass the cut version, though? Can your stamina go even further? Then why not take your chances on playing the full version of the map? With this, the beatmap is extended even further to around **11 minutes**, quite literally almost double the original rate's time! Once again, you barely will get any breaks in this beatmap, as it throws even more dumpstreams at you, plus a few trills and overall just a really difficult selection of patterning. It could really strain your fingers, especially if you come in unprepared.

Want to see more challenges like this beatmap in the Loved category? Do you want to see more action and see how other players can go with their stamina and speed? Share your thoughts, and do not forget to give your vote to this beatmap!

Whenever you think about jacks, certainly one map that may come into your mind would be [Captain Jack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1392679#mania/2902829) by [Jole](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2883132), who makes their way into the Loved nominations with another entry!

I mean, from the name itself, you can already assume what challenge this map provides to you, right? Right off the bat, [Captain Jack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1392679#mania/2902829) already has some anchors to deal with, which can be some of the most uncomfortable patterns especially if your wrists are unstable as you play them. Not to mention, there is also the presence of longjacks in this beatmap, wherein you really have to make sure you are able to press the same key consecutively numerous times.

With that being said, this map really tests how well you can control your fingers for jack patterns, as this really challenges how well you can balance the tendency to rush some of the parts in this beatmap. After all, getting 100s/50s also tends to be common for jacks as one may misread patterns due to fatigue.

If you think that you have what it takes to showcase your score to the rest of the world, or if you at least enjoy this beatmap and want to see it thrive within the community, then why not show your support for [Jole](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2883132), and hopefully give YOUR approval with a "yes" vote! After all, considering the patterning here, you could be a *CAPTAIN JACK* of your own.. am I right? \*wink wink\*

In osu!mania, at least in the 4K department, the association of Terminal 11 songs resonates so strongly that I think it's safe to say that this chart ticks all of our boxes. If you thought the [previously Loved Terminal 11 chart](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/659039#mania/3182140) wasn't enough, you haven't seen nothing like this just yet. We got something for you that is even spicier than that, and we will unleash this kind of "[*Fury*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1632108#mania/3331566)" charted by [Pizza69](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25285704)!

When I thought about this chart being used multiple times in the tournament scene, Pizza69 might have said something along the lines of "I'm about to unleash this fury of a chart towards these players." This is exactly the portrayal of what this chart actually is: hyper-aggressive bursts, lots of longer jacks in between the bursts, and all sorts of stuff that you might have to watch out for in this 4-minute gauntlet. What's even scarier is that the star rating for this chart is... criminally underrated, despite all of the things presented in this chart. It really is a wonder why coming close to a good run on this chart is considered quite the challenge.

That being said, charts like this are very hard to come by, and occurrences like these are exceptionally difficult to come by. If the normal rate isn't hard for you, then how about going the extra mile with uprates to 1.1x? That'd be quite an endeavour, but that will not happen if this chart does not pass in this current wave, so consider giving your unconditional support to Pizza69 with your "yes" vote!

An observation I'm sure a lot of people have made is that many charts out there feel much more "responsive" than others. Whether it's due to the chart being on the more simple side of things, or the song itself being the main factor, what we can say for sure is that [hna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12335541)'s rendition of [O.D](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1400718#mania/3225707) serves as one of the best examples behind this hard-to-define meaning.

You should be no stranger to Polyphia if you've played osu! for any amount of time. With their music having a heavy focus on both guitar and percussion, this chart manages to make the song play out as accurately as the song represents itself, with the main idea being that of using rice notes for the percussion, and long notes for the guitar. This simple idea is heavily elevated here: it allows for the chart to feel incredibly satisfying to play, and is likely the main reason behind why it has this responsive feeling.

If technical accuracy that remains faithful to the song is something you value, then you should stop at nothing for getting this chart into Loved. All it takes is a simple vote, so why not do just that?

Many will know this song from a variety of different rhythm games, and that's for good reason. However, players will know this mapset due to the sheer popularity it has been gaining over the years. This mapset appeals heavily to players of all skill levels due to being a good test of consistency, in both physicality for beginner players and accuracy for more advanced players, with the over seven minute of drain time.

With the addition of the lower two difficulties, this mapset is very easy to replay many times. If you are interested in seeing this map going into the Loved category, then be sure to show your support by voting on this map!

After a long break, [-MysticEyes](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6253266) has made their long-awaited return to the game. Alongside their return, they're also making a return to the Loved section with their chart of [Phoenix [feat. Kobaryo]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/816319#mania)!

Taking up the LN slot for this month, the main difficulty behind it comes from the relentless density and stamina it makes you go through. Being featured in both [osu!mania LN Tournament 3](/wiki/Tournaments/o!mLN/3) and [4 Digit Mania World Cup 3](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/3), it goes without question as to what made this chart a great LN density pick for tournaments. There's a lot of break sections throughout, but the near 4-minute long drain time makes it no easy feat when it comes to keeping your stamina, as once the chart picks up, it shows zero signs of letting down.

It's quite the testament to see it only having rates up to 1.1x, showing that the difficulty behind it is definitely nothing to scoff at, but if 180 BPM density is too easy for you, feel free to challenge yourself with the higher rates it has to offer! If you've ever enjoyed one of -MysticEyes' LN charts in the past, this should certainly be no exception. Give it your support!

With a lack of chordjacks in the 7K Loved section (and in general), we introduce yet another chordjack pick to the voting stage with [DaDarkDragon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8902097)'s chart of sakuzyo's [Lost Memory](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1312121#mania)!

This chart is even more straightforward than our previous nomination of [L9](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1427458). The 1.1x rate of this chart was used in [2022's iteration of the osu!mania 7K World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_7K). While this has always been a solid chart for practicing intermediate-level chordjacks, this chart actually saw a resurgence in popularity very recently with the advent of the unprecedented [osu!mania Apprentice-level 7K Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1796801?n=1), or MALT for short.

MALT attracted many 4K mains who sometimes played 7K and wanted to give it a shot in the tournament setting. From seeing the many scores of this chart posted by said group, we have seen that it is not physically demanding at all (and is actually very free in that regard). This enabled people to achieve absurd ratios, although they came at a cost. Since reading and consistency is quite a brick wall in 7K, these absurd ratios were often accompanied by a very high miss count.

I personally remember having a [particularly hard time learning jack skill sets in 7K in the past](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1145595?n=1) because of the sheer lack of charts for it in the leaderboarded sections of the game. We feel that *Lost Memory* perfectly encapsulates this part of the game that 7K Loved is severely lacking in, and we hope to help bridge this gap that I struggled to get past back in the day.

Of course, this pick has some rates on it too, so you can go for very high-accuracy scores at any rate. We hope you support and enjoy this pick. I certainly needed something like this back then.

[paradoxus\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11185275) and [Kawawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4647754) both return to the Loved voting at the same time with their collaboration chart of Camellia's [Electromagnetic Stealth Girl Born In Philadelphia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1544574#mania)!

This set is anything but straightforward. The original collab difficulty has dense speed and jack patterns interspersed with LNs, making this a very rude chart overall. It is difficult to hold combo.

There is also the difficulty with barely any LNs. As the Semifinals technical pick for [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_7K), this is similar to the original collab. However, it is actually easier overall, and you can focus solely on hitting the technical rice patterns instead of having to worry about the extra LNs here.

This is not something we typically pick for 7K Loved. It's rare to see charts like this nominated for the Loved category, so feel free to provide feedback on this pick (and our other osu!mania picks) if you would like to see changes to our methods in the future. As we try to represent a variety of charts here, we hope this pick will resonate with the community overall.

As part of our ongoing effort to bring the spotlight to more *O2Jam* charts for Project Loved, we introduce [prayingover](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4171840) (more commonly known as **nightshroud** in the *O2Jam* scene) with his set of fripSide's [Late in Autumn](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2057787#mania)! This set is a re-upload of a [somewhat popular set of *O2Jam* charts](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/533981), but this is in fact by the original charter.

This is as old-school as it gets for *O2Jam* charts. With the immense variety of LN patterns and the insane difficulty spikes, getting a high combo on the Hard difficulty is no easy feat. However, don't worry if your general skill is not as high, as there are two easier difficulties for you to enjoy.

Typically, our *O2Jam* nominations tend to cater towards a high-level audience on average, so we hope that people of many skill levels can enjoy this set. Make sure you give your support if you want to see a continued effort to embrace *O2Jam*-style charts.
