We don't need an introduction. This is **Ruby My Dear**.

A veteran of his craft, **Ruby My Dear** has been churning out intricate breakcore tunes for nearly 15 years, showcasing an avant-garde style that distinctly separates him from any other producer.

**16** tracks sourced from everywhere in **Ruby My Dear**'s discography are ready for mapping, all available as pre-timed `.osz`s from [**Ruby My Dear**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/370)!

osu! has been entranced by **Ruby My Dear**'s sound for years, appealing to mappers and players who seek out the complexity that really makes a rhythm game a *rhythm* game. If you're not sure what we mean, take a peek at some of the mapping scene's creativity thus far:

There's no point in waiting. [**Ruby My Dear**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/370) is right there with even more songs, and your next mapping session is about to begin.

Once you're done with that, keep an eye out for our next Featured Artist this coming Saturday! We'll also be publishing the winners from last month's [**Featured Artist playlists** in osu!(lazer)](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-06-03-new-featured-artist-andora#featured-artist-playlists) at that time, so keep your other eye on the lookout for that.

And as per usual, the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) or the `#featured-artists` channel in the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy) are the places to be if you want to keep track of everything.

Stay tuned.
