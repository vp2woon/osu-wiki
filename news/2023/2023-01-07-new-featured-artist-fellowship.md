Ever since [Glory Days](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1781620) made it to the ranked section, **Fellowship** was prophesised to join our Featured Artist catalogue.

If power metal and insane streams are your two favourite things, you might wanna check out [**Fellowship**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/332) for **10** future osu! classics.
