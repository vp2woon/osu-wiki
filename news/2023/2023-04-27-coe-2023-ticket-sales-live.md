It's about time to get excited for perhaps the biggest offline osu! event of the year!

![](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event/2023/img/banner.png)

Needing no further introduction to most, **cavoe's osu! event** (***COE***) is returning yet again this summer at **Brabanthallen in Den Bosch, Netherlands**, gathering people from around the globe to meet, greet, compete and experience all things osu! (+ other rhythm games).

Right now, here are the things we can confirm will happen:

- Various stage events
- Arcade with a slew of rhythm games courtesy of [WoozPC](https://woozpc.nl/)
- 1v1 osu! tournament hosted by COE staff
- osu!taiko tournament hosted by the [Global Taiko Showdown](https://gtsosu.com/) team
- Lots of osu! shenanigans

...and that's just the tip of everything that's planned! Parts of it will also be livestreamed on the [COEvent Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/coevent) for everyone at home.

Apart from the activities held, this is essentially just a big meetup for like-minded circle clickers, drum bashers, fruit catchers and key smashers. Bringing friends or meeting new ones is the way to get the most fun out of it! And speaking of socialising, judging from past years, we have a hunch that people will share everything about it on Twitter. Especially the delicious food.

Sounds exciting? The place to be is **Brabanthallen in Den Bosch, Netherlands** during the week of **July 31 to August 6**. Visit the [COE website](https://cavoeboy.com/) for all the details, and follow [@CavoesOsuEvent on Twitter](https://twitter.com/CavoesOsuEvent) or join the [COE Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/d6ru6PVcSY) for updates and upcoming announcements. You may also want to bookmark the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event/2023) for future reference.

Oh, right, the big news is of course that **[ticket sales are now live](https://cavoeboy.com/)** as of last weekend. Peruse the ever-growing [attendee list](https://cavoeboy.com/attendees) to see if your favourite osu! player is coming.

See you there!
