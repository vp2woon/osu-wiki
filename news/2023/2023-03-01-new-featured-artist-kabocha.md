**Kabocha** brings an ever-evolving style into our Featured Artist collection!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/345/header.jpg)

From *SOUND VOLTEX* to *Taiko no Tatsujin*, Japanese composer and producer **Kabocha** made waves in rhythm game scenes for years.

It wasn't always that way, though. Before gaining traction in rhythm games, his style was a combination of visual kei and EDM, which has continually transformed thanks to his growing involvement in doujin production circles.

As of today, **Kabocha**'s music is finally ready for osu!. **9** awesome tracks all across the genre spectrum are ready for mapping from [**Kabocha**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/345)!

Witness multiple osu! players as they struggle to maintain decent accuracy on a calm map, then listen to the previews for a few more of **Kabocha**'s diverse tunes:
