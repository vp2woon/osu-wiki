174 BPM never sounded *truly* smooth until **Liquicity** stepped in.

osu!'s Featured Artist program is no stranger to the top-of-the-line drum & bass label **Liquicity**. We've worked with them previously to bring artists like [Feint](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/306), [Rameses B](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/270), [Station Earth / Blue Marble](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/66), [Andromedik](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/177), [Lexurus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/208), [T & Sugah](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/188), [Boxplot](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/154), and [Maduk](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/235) to the osu! community.

Today, we have **7 songs** from **7 different artists** to showcase, all of which can be found on the new [**Liquicity** Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/340)! (A record label *technically* isn't an "artist", but the alternative is 7 new listings with 1 song each, so let's not worry about the details.)

Anyway, take a gander at every newly added track, starting with this video of an Alternate mod play in osu!(lazer):
