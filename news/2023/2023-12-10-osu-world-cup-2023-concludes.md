---

An osu! tournament of the highest calibre comes to an end. Join us as we get up to speed on the latest and greatest battles and top it off with insights from a now-reigning champion, a staff member and a contributing artist!

![](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2023/img/owc2023-banner.jpg)

The last couple of months have been a wild ride for everyone participating in the World Cup. This year's iteration has managed to thwart all expectations, from the creativity shown by the mappers and poolers showcasing their labours of love to the community, to the performances shown by some teams who foiled the status quo. Suffice to say, the 14th iteration of the [osu! World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2023) has surpassed the whole staff team's expectations, and we hope it did the same for you as well.

So, buckle up! We have seven weeks worth of delightful matches, highlights, and even a few interviews to go over.

## Summary

![](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2023/img/podium@2x.jpg)

Congratulations to the United States for claiming their 6th consecutive year of osu! world championship! This Grand Final match was *extremely close*, the closest it has ever been for the USA since [2015](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2015#match-results), with exchanges of break points left and right and a showdown on the tiebreaker.

Both commiserations and congratulations to South Korea and Australia. South Korea has been one of the fiercest rivals to the United States and almost clinched the gold spot for the first time since 2013, while Australia made it to the podium for the first time ever.

The podium countries of the osu! World Cup 2023 had been determined. The medalists would come from Australia, South Korea and the United States, while the bronze medal goes to the Australian team after a 1–7 defeat against quite dominant Americans. Consequently, an identical bracket situation as last year occurred: South Korea needed only one match victory against the USA while the North American roster had to win the Grand Finals as well as the bracket reset to become champions.

The strengths of both teams were clearly defined. The USA emphasised a strategy of mechanics and speed, whereas South Korea had stellar players for tech and aim control. The American team got the 2–0 head start with an early break point, but the Korean squad quickly recovered and started to win their HD picks and kept the scoreline close, resulting in a 3–4 deficit. A festival of four consecutive break points followed, including two impressive 1,000,000+ HR scores by ::{ flag=US }:: [Rektygon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7813296) and ::{ flag=KR }:: [[Karcher]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11443437). This neck-and-neck fight came to an end on [Denkishiki Karen Ongaku Shuudan - E.E.L.S.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2095134#osu/4392973) as ::{ flag=US }:: [tekkito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7075211)'s HD near full combo made the crucial difference. With this 7–5 victory for the US, the bracket has been reset.

The deciding match has been full of surprises as well. It took only two maps until another streak of four break points happened. In the midst of all the chaos, ::{ flag=KR }:: [worst hr player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14106450) set a historical score. Ironically on the HR3 map, [LV.4 - Burning Star](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2095154#osu/4393036), he managed to land the full combo with 99% accuracy and displayed the arguably best tournament play of all time. With this huge momentum boost, South Korea followed up with an important break point for the 5–3 lead. Nevertheless, the American team didn't give up and immediately answered with their own two points. Eventually, the match had to be decided by the tiebreaker [Release Hallucination - VANITAS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2095177#osu/4393066). It was the all-star ::{ flag=US }:: [Vaxei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4787150) who was able to reach a four-digit combo and thus provided the small, but critical gap in this incredible match.

## Highlights

### The greatest tournament play of all time

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/83077CifykM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

... was set by ::{ flag=KR }:: [worst hr player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14106450) during the Grand Finals of OWC 2023, and we're not just saying that ourselves! [LV.4 - Burning Star](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2095154#osu/4393036) mapped by [ktgster](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/53378) is an *unrelenting* cursor control stamina gauntlet requiring concentration unimaginable by anyone to not only achieve a **full combo** on, but that with **99% accuracy**.

### The hyeok squad

> don't sleep on hyeok and the hyeoks

—enri

::{ flag=PH }:: [hyeok2044](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8472976)'s return from military service was honoured in immaculate taste by the creation of the hyeok squad, featuring:

- ::{ flag=PH }:: [hyeok2043](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4734703) (NathanRam1918)
- ::{ flag=PH }:: hyeok2044 (the original)
- ::{ flag=PH }:: [hyeok2045](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8640970) (enri)
- ::{ flag=PH }:: [hyeok2046](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9642774) (Milkteaism)
- ::{ flag=PH }:: [hyeok2047](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1492995) (zonelouise)
- ::{ flag=PH }:: [hyeok2048](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12040280) (Xyloz)
- ::{ flag=PH }:: [hyeok2049](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13484596) (Impowster)
- ::{ flag=PH }:: [hyeok2050](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12028437) (Miggie)

The tournament client always displays players' current handles, which hilariously caused some mild headaches as casters were trying their best to communicate which hyeok they're talking about to the audience in various ways, including completely and understandably giving up on it.

## Match highlights

## Showmatches

Each rendition of the osu! World Cup in the last few years has boasted exciting "non-canon" showmatches outside the main schedule. During the later stages, these matches were played in order to show off maps from the mappools that might otherwise not have been played in real matches.

### SHIP IT vs. steamhappy (Semifinals)

[**View the VOD here!**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1980984349)

Thought to be a break from the chaotic, high-stakes matches happening in the Semifinals, the showmatch on November 18 proved no escape, as the playtesters led by [D I O](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619) and [Azer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578) stepped in for some of their most novel tournament performances of the year. Both sides won their first picks quickly but not quietly — [nanoya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12366071)'s 915k play on the classic HR stream map [xi - Blue Zenith](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/292301#osu/657917) was absolutely massive, as some would say.

After a few more back-and-forths, the teams alternated taking break points starting with an impressive 727k S-rank score from [Nopekjk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4585186) on alt-tech [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2088310#osu/4376248). [Saryi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10051720)'s MVP precision performance on [Toru Kawai - The Magician's Dream](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2088436#osu/4376547) secured the final blow as a 6–4 for SHIP IT.

### All Stars Red vs. All Stars Blue (Finals)

[**View the VOD here!**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1987883013)

Emerging from the bloodbath of the Finals stage a week later was a showmatch with teams consisting of fallen players from previous weeks. The momentum created by [Mastasz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1876565)' 1-miss score on awkward DT pick [Susumu Hirasawa - SWITCHED-ON LOTUS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/16457#osu/58970) brought the blue team to a speedy 5–0 in their favour, though not without struggle. Just one more combo break from [kiirochii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6387149) on [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2091780#osu/4384637) or more scattered misses on [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2091798#osu/4384680) could have swung the scoreline in the other direction.

With nothing but bragging rights at stake, All Stars Blue picked into [xi - FREEDOM DiVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/39804)... and let's just say [Ekoro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/284905) took advantage of the fact that EZ and FL were allowed by the referee on Free Mod.

And his team looked unstoppable, having gained 6 points in a row with team red having nil to say about it. Two thirds of the way through [Rohi - Gllensista](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2091797#osu/4384679) however, team blue was holding a 200k point lead and looked to secure the sweep — but in the blink of an eye, the whole lobby except [scylla](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9405745) collapsed. All Stars Red managed to keep the match alive a little longer before [Chicony](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5199332) and [Kingling](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7010761) carried team blue across the finish line on [FELT - Puppet in the Dark](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/326636#osu/725198), ending in a 7–3.

Unfortunately there was no showmatch of the Grand Finals pool due to internal issues, but hopefully the actual matches made up for it.

Following the growth of osu!'s [Featured Artists](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists), it should be no surprise that this year's osu! World Cup coordinated the production of original music (which we call [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals)) specifically for its mappools.

Despite these expectations, absolutely no one was prepared for a massive haul of **20** new tracks, along with original artworks designed by members of the osu! community for the maps' backgrounds.

To honour the outstanding creative talent behind these maps, we've neatly laid them out for you below! Click on any banner below to visit its respective map, where you'll be able to admire both the song and its background in their full glory.

## Interviews

To get a slightly better understanding for how things went from the perspective of players, staff and artists, here are a few words from a few of the many individuals who have been involved.

::{#kama}::

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-12-10-osu-world-cup-2023-concludes/Kama-banner.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13380270)

**Kama** (a.k.a. cheetoblast) was one of the new players of the winning team this year along with [WindowLife](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4108547) and [wudci](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2590257). While their portfolio of tournament podium positions are fewer in number compared to the World Cup veterans of the team, their performance was by no means insignificant.

---

*Were there any aspirations or goals that you've set for yourself for the World Cup that you are able to look back upon?*

> Ever since I started playing osu!, making the World Cup team for USA was a huge goal that I've always wanted to achieve. It feels surreal that not only was I able to make the team, but we won. My mindset coming into OWC was not just to win, but to feel like I tried my best and be able to look back and be proud of myself.
> 
> A year ago, I would've made my goals more measurable, like top scoring on a map. Of course, I still want to get really cool scores on maps, but this experience has taught me that intrinsic values are more important. I'm glad that with this OWC, I was able to enjoy the experience that myself, teammates, and staff members created, and I appreciate the opportunity to compete.

*This year has had very volatile moments for the United States. Would you mind sharing what has been going on in your minds?*

> I'll admit, losing to Canada in Quarterfinals was very scary to me. When you are put on the USA OWC team, the community sets the biggest expectations on you, so when you don't fulfill them, you no longer feel confident about yourself. The week after that match was definitely the most demotivated I've been playing osu! in a long time. Although the loss was a bit disappointing to me and our teammates, we were able get our head back in the game and take the crown.

*Do you have thoughts about the community reaction for your victory?*

> As many people know, the USA roster has been changing so much every year. As a rookie this year, it is a bit discouraging when people don't want you to win due to the precedent that the USA has set for themselves. But, I wouldn't let that stop me from doing my best and helping to carry the torch for another year.

**Doomsday** has been ever present since the dawn of the game's lifetime, providing commentary in numerous world cups (including 8 matches in this one), hosting the Corgi Cup tournament series as well as [creating music](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=artist%3D%22Doomsday%22&s=any) as of recent, just to name a few things about this frankly awesome dude.

As you can tell by glancing below, he had a whole lot to say, but we unfortunately have to cut it short for this post! [**View the full interview of 5 questions here.**](https://gist.github.com/Walavouchey/080fd65497e0b434e41ab6faedb017de)

*What do you think changed in this year's South Korea that enabled their team to come so close to overtaking the United States, or were other factors at play?*

> In terms of ability, the South Korean and United States rosters are very comparable, but I think a lot of it comes down to how confident the South Korean team is now, after they were the ones to end the United States' unbeaten run in the 2022 edition. The debuff of facing USA is infamous, and teams have struggled to keep their mental game strong when going up against them. Once SK got that victory, they must have believed that they were the chosen ones. They really did look like the team to beat, and it felt inevitable that they would be in the final again.
> 
> The US team of 2023 was certainly a lot different, but they were just as talented as before. I can only imagine that the other contenders were a little braver about facing the USA in 2023 compared to the last few years, though. This certainly showed in how much closer many of the games involving the USA were.
> 
> When USA and South Korea met in the grand final, it was between two teams who were both incredibly talented, but also fully confident in their ability to win. It could have gone either way, but in the end, the United States just had that little more versatility once the mappool thinned out.
> 
> By the way, what a performance from the rookies on the United States. wudci and WindowLife, two new players, were involved in the bracket reset tiebreaker, and the occasion didn't phase them. Very well done.

*You've been present in the World Cup scene since its infancy. Do you have overall thoughts on its growth, reflections on facets of production, past and present, or where the osu! World Cup is headed?*

> The thing that I find quite interesting in how the OWC has evolved over the years, is that it's essentially had a very similar level of viewership on twitch since the 2013 iteration, which was the first one that had proper production for the viewers. However, back then the only traffic really going into it was funneled from the game itself. You didn't really see much chatter about it outside of the forums, or the in-game chats. Since then, so many sub-communities surrounding osu! have sprung up and dominated the discussion, making the world cups feel so much bigger than they did before. Even though Reddit or Twitter were not nearly as big for osu! discussion, those scuffed VODs for OWC 2013 pulled similar levels of viewership to what we have had in the latest iteration. The discussions surrounding it make such a huge difference for the modern tournaments.
> 
> OWC always felt very official in comparison to working with community-run events that are often more casual. In the last few years however, OWC has become more relaxed on the staff side, as more talent from the community tournament scene are now running the show. The level of quality has remained pretty consistent, but the atmosphere is definitely more relaxed than it was when I first joined the team.
> 
> It's hard to call where OWC may be going in the future, but it seems to me that more people are talking about it than ever. We're seeing more content creators making OWC videos, more involved discussions about the matches, more players streaming their sides of the games, people spreading the big moments on social media, and things like that. A wave of original maps, music and artwork specifically made for the world cups are now becoming a fixture, and these could very well become synonymous with the OWC. The players are more dedicated than ever. Many country-centric osu! communities practice together with the hope that they can compete at the next OWC, which is so cool to see. One thing is for sure, people are more passionate about the world cup now than they ever have been before, and that can only mean good things for where OWC is going, right?

**seleP** perhaps needs no introduction to most people who have played osu! during the last decade, but anyone uninitiated may find the [Featured Artist page](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/138) a perfect read. For this tournament, **seleP** composed [Sara](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2088549#osu/4376782) which appeared as the No Mod 3 beatmap of the Semifinals mappool.

*Most players of osu! probably know you for your song Scarlet Rose, due to it being featured in a beatmap that is among the most popular in the game. Do you have any thoughts on its reception or about the song in general?*

> *Scarlet Rose*, alongside *Chloe*, was originally created to celebrate the 1-year anniversary of the release of the VOCALOID Lily. I aimed to produce a song with a higher tempo and an exhilarating feel.

*What kind of concept did you have in mind when composing Sara?*

> Seeing the popularity of *Scarlet Rose* within the osu! community, I decided to specifically implement similar composition and musical progression.

*Would you mind sharing a brief window into your thoughts behind its lyrics?*

> *Scarlet Rose* had that trademark Yandeloid melody and lyrics. With *Sara*, I aimed to tell a different, unique story while retaining the Yandeloid feeling.

*Has the workflow in composing specifically for a video game feature presented challenges or been any different to your usual works?*

> Normally, my primary objective is to create music to my liking, but this time I had to compose based on the premise that it would be used in a rhythm game. It was challenging to create a song that aligned with the vision of the osu! team while also ensuring it was enjoyable to play.

*Have you been able to follow the osu! World Cup matches so far? Do you have any message for players and spectators?*

> I was able to watch the first match where *Sara* got played. It was very thrilling to watch players and spectators from around the world come together to make it such an exciting match.

*What inspires you to create music?*

> Everyday experiences, as well as manga and movies I have encountered, all serve as sources of inspiration for me.

*Of the tracks you've released so far, do you have a favourite?*

> *Chloe*, my most played Lily song, is one of my favourites. Among the IA songs it would be *Re;BIRTH*, which has been used in another video game ([IA/VT Colorful](https://ia-vt.marv.jp/)).

*Creation of original music for osu! tournaments and the like has significantly increased over the past few years, both from the osu! team and the community. Do you have advice for aspiring artists on osu! who want to create music for the game?*

> I am not in a position to give too much advice, ^^;
> but I believe the key is to create a song that you genuinely enjoy!

## Statistics

It wouldn't be a World Cup without some new records, world firsts and interesting stats overall. [shdewz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10000899), one of our World Cup statisticians, has compiled stats for every single stage of this year's cup and put them all into fancy spreadsheets of their design (and yes there is such a thing as spreadsheet design). While you can check out the full spreadsheets with [general information](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kzHae-PAHE7_PLy5L3Nhu97lslRLJoc5T6u-GEW1x6E/pubhtml) and [individual stage stats](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zsYCBrFdX1KU2YaCVBBSVrtoJp39306U), here is an excerpt of some of the more interesting tidbits:

- The OWC pp record was shattered three different times, first with [maliszewski](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961)'s HDHR FC on [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1964101#osu/4319264) during the [Round of 16 match vs. Brazil](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/111188366) with 717 pp, then [worst hr player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14106450)'s [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/292301#osu/658127) FC during the [Semifinals match vs. the Philippines](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/111366414) worth 754 pp, and finally the new OWC performance point record is now being held by [Rektygon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7813296) with their [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2091805#osu/4384687) FC during the [Finals match vs. Germany](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/111466879) worth 763 pp.
- The biggest upset of the tournament (according to [hallowatcher's pick'ems results](/wiki/shared/news/2023-12-10-osu-world-cup-2023-concludes/pickem.png)) was the [Australia vs. Poland match](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/111271525) that took place in Quarterfinals. With 1340 votes, only 5.8% of voters guessed that Australia would win the match.
- Kazakhstan successfully qualified for the first time ever, and even though they got kicked out by Japan during the Round of 16, they had an impressive showing.
- There were 6 countries that participated in the osu! World Cup for the first time ever: India, Mongolia, Panama, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates.

Apart from the contributors, we'd also like to thank the **[439 tournament participants](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2023#participants)** as well as everyone who watched the osu! World Cup 2023.

Despite not being an easy feat, with each passing year the tournament only grows more and more ambitious. Who knows what awaits us in its 15th anniversary next year — we're all eager to see what the organisers have in store!

But until then, farewell.
