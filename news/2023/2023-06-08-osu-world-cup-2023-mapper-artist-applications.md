Calling out any osu! mappers who think they have what it takes – the registrations for mapper and artist contributions for the osu! World Cup 2023 are now open!

For those of you who have been living under a particularly comfy rock for the past decade or so, the osu! World Cup is the official country-based tournament supported by the osu! team, and for the last couple of years, it has used increasingly more bespoke maps made specifically for the tournament – some of which even feature completely new songs made by our very talented [Featured Artist lineup](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists), which includes maps you might know, such as [seatrus - EXXTRA JUDGEMENT](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1889132#osu/3890723), [Yooh - RPG](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1633250#osu/3333745), [II-L feat. amelie xoxo - THE EARTH](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1889101#osu/3941094), [Camellia - OOPARTS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1312143), and plenty more.

*They love capital letters, don't they? We should probably cut down on the amount of alphabet soup served at the next FA meeting...*

With the increasing amount of content created specifically for the tournament in mind, we have opened a few forms for those who wish to contribute to this ongoing effort.

## Mapper

If you're an osu! mapper who is confident in your mapping abilities, is receptive to feedback and willing to shape their map to the tournament's needs, doesn't mind letter-shaped noodles, and would like to work on a map for the biggest tournament of the year, then head on over to [this registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxQfsFZsSnrcqBN0tUPrlq0OczluC5yH9h1lUZF3x8pgCV9Q/viewform) and put your name out there for the organisers to see! Just make sure you do so **before July 2nd**, otherwise they may not be seen anymore or something. You never know.

## Artist

If you're an artist or designer who wants to help with producing background art for upcoming [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals), make sure to fill [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1A-Yf7TUvwhniMPTqYL0l_7bLjvuIV5XRbzlz8_fW5nY/viewform), and we will reach out when the opportunity arises. This form does not have a time limit – art is always on demand to accompany our ever-expanding library of bespoke music.
