We're proud to add legendary vocalist **kakichoco** to our collection of Featured Artists!

You'd expect the performance points algorithm to be *more* balanced right after a rework, but **kakichoco**'s [Zan'ei](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1759729) proved that wrong.

Ever since [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902)'s [1,244 pp score](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/4185178306) last summer (since rebalanced to *only* 1,033 pp), **kakichoco** has become a household name in every osu! player's beatmap library, and we're here to pull her into our Featured Artist library too!

**7** songs from **kakichoco**'s debut album of originals *Enrai* are ready to pluck from [her Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/336)!

If you're one of the three people who've never heard **kakichoco**'s vocals, take a seat and check out what's in store:
