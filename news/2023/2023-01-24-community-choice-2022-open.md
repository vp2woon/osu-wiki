Look back on 2022 and pick out your favourite maps in all four game modes in one of the year's biggest polls!

Long ago in a distant realm, some intrepid fellow began a timeless tradition of coming together as a community and trying to decide what the best map of the previous year was. If you're older than the Earth, you might remember this as the 'Best of' polls, and if you're a little newer, you might know this as our fabled Community Choice contests.

As usual, you are entitled to **10 votes per game mode** to be spent on **any map ranked during 2022 that you have played at least once**. Liked a map but didn't play it for whatever reason? Some might call this a skill issue.

The top 10 picks as voted for by the community will be dubbed as the *Community Favourites of 2022*, with the #1 from each game mode offered a shiny new profile badge as well. All finalists will receive 6 months of osu!supporter to help push them through the first half of 2023 as they (likely) get started on their next amazing creation.

Additionally, we'll be continuing the **Mappers' Favourite** trend established in early 2020, where we split off the votes of anyone who has ranked at least one map ever into a distinct award to help the mapping community have their say in what beatmaps really hit the spot last year. This all happens automatically, so doubly make sure you get involved if you want to have your ranked mapper opinion heard.

Speaking of the mapping community, here's some interesting stats from 2022 to showcase how things have developed:

- In osu! during 2022, **18,620** difficulties were ranked across **3,406** sets for a total of **37,954** minutes of content. This is **3.9%** more maps overall than 2021.
- In osu!taiko during 2022, **4,873** difficulties were ranked across **1,116** sets for a total of **12,778** minutes of content. 2022 was a good year for those fond of dons and kats, as this is a whopping **37.4%** increase in total sets compared to 2021's numbers. Wow!
- In osu!catch during 2022, **1,780** difficulties were ranked across **364** sets for a total of **3,593** minutes of content. This is **0.2%** more than 2021's numbers, which means our high-fibre fanatics are keeping their throughput pretty steady!
- In osu!mania during 2022, **4,622** difficulties were ranked across **891** sets for a total of **12,000** minutes of content. This is an **ASTRONOMICAL** increase of **115.73%** compared to 2021's numbers, highlighting an absolutely explosive display of growth.

If those numbers have hyped you up, there's only one thing to do (vote):

- [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/162)
- [osu!taiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/163)
- [osu!catch](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/164)
- [osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/165)

The voting will stay open for **14 days** from the date of this post, so if you're on the fence about having your say in the most popular maps of 2022, you've got exactly that long to brood about it.

By the way, if you're not already aware, many countries host their own unofficial top 10 map/player votes around this time of year, often times in the [language-specific sections of the osu! forums](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums). Why not head over and get involved, or if none are running, start your own?

Best of luck to everyone who mapped something in 2022, and remember — if you don't vote, you don't get to complain about who wins! *We'll know.*
