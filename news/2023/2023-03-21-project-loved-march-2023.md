Celebrate the start of spring with an equally charming set of Loved nominations!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

To those who're still unfamiliar with what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As always, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the February votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

- [Results for osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1726290)

Before we move on, here's an update from the innings of Project Loved:

- As you may recall, we've opened applications for the osu! Loved captain position [last month](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-02-24-project-loved-february-2023). We went through all the applicants carefully and we're more than happy to announce that [Aistre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879380), [Kingling](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7010761), and [megumic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7537133) will be joining the osu! captains in order to make sure that all of your favourite beatmaps are given the *lovable* treatment they deserve!
- We'd also like to take a moment to thank [Irisu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8595858) for her valuable contributions towards the development of the [Project Loved website](https://loved.sh/) and the task of making sure that descriptions are crispy clean, as she has decided to move on from the project. We wish her the best in her future endeavours!

That should be it for now. Don't forget if you have any questions, or you're interested in participating in Project Loved discussions of a certain game mode, you can reach out in one of the Project Loved Discord servers listed below:

[Chelmico - Easy Breezy (7_7 bootleg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1585404#osu) by [Seamob](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10840806)\
210 BPM, 2:13 | 8.26★\
*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

[Seamob](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10840806) really knows how to make bangers huh.

With multiple wildly successful maps within the category, this month's *Popular Playcount* pick is yet another bootleg stamina shredder. With the given mapper, 210 BPM, and 8.26\*, what this map accomplishes is self-explanatory. Glued together by a banger bootleg remix, there's a lot to love with this map. If you find as much enjoyment as over a hundred thousand others did, I'd recommend you vote yes to see this in Loved!

[Beatdrop - Phase 1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/526397#osu) by [rustbell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/227717)\
155 BPM, 2:06 | 6.48★\
*description written by [rHO](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1629553)*

This month's *Outstanding Oldies* pick will be... [rustbell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/227717)'s map of [Beatdrop - Phase 1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/526397#osu/1116977)!

rustbell comes with a simple, yet masterful and effective attempt on conveying constant repetitions on his take of *Phase 1*. Despite having only the same rhythms to build up with for the entire song, rustbell somehow just knows how to twist them in a way that is just so... *rustbell*. I feel silly trying to describe or tell you what this map does — it's like he does variations of the same thing every measure, and he does it in a new way every time. Really, it's best for you to look at the map yourself and be impressed at first hand.

It's fresh, it's interesting, and most importantly, it's *rustbell*. Go check it out if you haven't!

*description written by [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)*

This month's *Small Spectacles* pick shows exactly why you can't always trust play count to evaluate a map's worth.

[Frank Zappa - St. Alfonzo's Pancake Breakfast / Father O'Blivion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/830461) mapped by [headphonewearer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5087744) is the definition of unconventional, and brings into life so much of what Project Loved is all about. Frank Zappa, for those of you who are younger, is one of the fathers of experimental music. And as such, a map from one of his songs could not be more exotic. What even is a timing signature, anyway? Weave your cursor between patterns that cover strange rhythms in an extremely fun fashion as you uncover what in the world this map is going to surprise you every next few seconds.

If you feel like Loved needs more of what sets it apart from Ranked, this is a map you should vote for!

*description written by [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)*

What do you hope to prove?

The *Daredevil Difficulties* pick for this month is none other than [HML](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757424)'s mapset of [Rings of Saturn - Senseless Massacre](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/507278). Some of you may know the song from [this other mapset](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/490121) by [Mazzerin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2942381), and we are still hoping that full version gets ranked eventually as Mazzerin has told us. A song so overly extreme that it has become a bit of a meme between metalheads, this map does not let down. With difficulties spanning from 1.57\* up to 10.17\*, it tests every possible limit, from nearly full-screen jumps to absurdly spaced 270 BPM deathstreams.

If you're looking for insanity, search no further — vote for this one.

Lost in a purgatory from years ago, this *Ranked Reject* is the epitome of the section.

[A.SAKA - Nanatsu Koyoto](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/768281#osu/1618329) hosts many of the most respected names in mapping, so with **17 difficulties**, a unique experience is consistently provided. This set sits at a middling length of nearly 2.5 minutes, with a star rating spread of 2.04\* to 6.7\*. One of my personal favourites from this set is [yf_bmp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1243669)'s diff, providing a unique take through awkward sliders and quint wiggles.

However, it's not an outlier — it's the norm, with every map on this set providing something new. Vote to help this *Ranked Reject* finally get the glory it deserves!

I don't think I need to explain anything else, really, but this is the *Gameplay Gimmicks* pick for the month. If you've played the *Rhythm Heaven* series of games, you know what to expect. If you haven't I won't spoil it for you, but definitely check this out, as it is a perfect emulation of the game using the tools in the osu! editor. *Woah, you go, big guy!*

Electronic meme remixes have been a staple of Loved ever since its inception, especially ones that highlight what all the different cultures in the world are capable of... "showcasing".

Hitting close just at 82.30% last time that this was nominated, I feel like *Cross Time !!* deserves a second chance. This basically feels like if the Avengers of old mappers came and participated in one mapset — it's got big names like DJPop, Lesjuh, ignorethis, and darrihuka (also known for his DaRRi MiX difficulties) to name a few. All in it's raw form dated back from 2009, it's filled with classic map goodness.

If you're an old map enthusiast, this mapset is for you — go ahead and dig in!

The *Chill Champions* category is here with a rather exotic pick.

[Bad Bunny - Yonaguni](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1487122) mapped by [Tatan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5646529) is what happens when you out-reggaeton a reggaeton song. In this map, Tatan makes use of ingenious hitsounding with the instruments and samples commonly used in the genre and crafts a simple, yet satisfying map that could entertain both casual and experienced players alike, as it makes for a very fun Double Time map.

The play count doesn't lie, as it is one of the most played unranked maps with a top difficulty under 5\*. What better choice for the category? If you agree, then this is a good pick to vote for!

I CAN'T TAKE CONTROL!!! For the first *Wildcard* pick of the month, I will be picking [nhlx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3827077)'s (a.k.a. Raikozen or Styxwater) map of [FICKLE SOULS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/989582).

This has been my favorite tech map for a while — and I feel like this map should have more credit than it does. Doing the song justice, nhlx cooks up a perfect combination of exciting yet buttery smooth gameplay filled with high-velocity sliders that suit the unhinged and angry nature of the song — and man oh man, did he cook. I don't want to get too ahead of myself here, but this map is insane in the best way possible. It's loud, aggressive, and *slider-tastic*; you're in for a treat.

If you feel like you're a slider demon yourself, check this map out!

For our second *Wildcard* pick of the month comes a classic song to osu!mania, yet fresh to osu!; [Colorful Sounds Port - ETERNAL DRAIN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/643448#osu/2946267)

The first thing you may notice about this set might be the the absolutely absurd 10.6\* diff, or even the blistering fast 149 BPM 1/8 patterns, both quite noteworthy. But that's not all there is, despite being top-heavy, as the spread ranges from 1.87\* to 10.6\*. So if you, similarly to me, cannot tap 298 BPM streams, there's still high-quality fun awaiting you. All of that without mentioning how insane the song is — oh my god it's so good!?

Vote yes to watch these leaderboards get shredded.

For the third *Wildcard* pick of this month, I'll be completely honest: I just instantly felt like this one deserved a chance.

[Itsvet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9989784)'s map of [YUC'E - Future Cider](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1002932#osu) looks majestic. With its flawless presentation, it definitely makes you wonder why this map isn't more popular. The map also features a fun set of hitsounds that complement the song without taking away feedback from the player, but be prepared for patterns that require some extreme precision and speed.

For a mapper that currently has no Ranked maps, this one truly is an insane feat of mapping skill and prowess, and this is the kind of thing we want to highlight in Project Loved.

Only the \[Katatic Crazy Party (Fixed)\] difficulty is being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

We really were overdue with this one, because not only is this one of the most iconic gimmick maps out there, it's one of the first maps ever to explore just how far these gimmicks could go: yellow notes, slider disruption, tricolor streams, and the constant call-and-response with extreme SV usage makes this just as insane as it is fun, which couldn't have been made by anybody other than [Fantazy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6890639) and [katacheh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6651672) themselves.

This beatmap is quite a test of skill with its tricky patterns, its multiple nuisances, and plenty of sections which are better off memorized than sight-read.

So, if you're up to the challenge, prepare both your eyes and hands as well as your pc for this chaotic P2W experience!

*description written by [Gamelan4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9856910)*

*[Metaroom](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1415961#taiko/2918088)* is no stranger in our percussion-driven world, with several beatmaps of their songs gaining considerable traction in both the casual and competitive scene.

Now, read closely: the formula for success is as follows. First, let's combine this artist with one of the most notorious taiko mappers. Then, have the map not only featured on the most important tournament of the game mode, but have it as a custom map specifically made for the event. The result is *Metaroom - Angel* by [Genjuro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3196091), a map with a challenging nature that doesn't intimidate but attracts all kinds of drum smashers, becoming an important benchmark in the community.

Any longer delays, and we at Loved HQ would have completely missed the opportunity to give this map the nomination it deserves. We highly recommend giving it a try, but beware of angels — they beat demons professionally, after all.

[Lze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7597914)'s map of *xi - Sparking Revolver* is an overmapped masterpiece that has captured the hearts of higher-ranked taiko players looking for a tech challenge. That is why I think this map deserves more attention than it already has.

It is expertly mapped, with challenging patterns and creative snapping choices that require the player to stay alert at all times and constantly be engaged, which only shows that Lze was really ahead of his time back in 2018.

Overall, it's a great example of creative overmapping that might have inspired many of the present-day overmapped tech maps. Are you ready for this sparking shootout? 🔫✨

Continuing from last month, here are some highly difficult maps.

*Cyte - Xinyi Dist (1010 Edit) (lazh's280boot)* was created by *kkdd*, a robot mapper from Korea. [applerss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/983349), who has created a number of beloved maps, designed this one to challenge even advanced players. The BPM is a lightning-fast 280, and the SR is a whopping 7.94! This map is perfect for leveling up your skills, or for advanced players to warm up.

Think you can beat applerss? Take the challenge now!

*description written by [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)*

It has been more than 5 years now since *Various BGM* was Loved, and now, its sequel is finally here for voting!

I don't even know where to start on this. There are just so many difficulties and each of them play differently, so if I were to talk about them in detail I could write a novel. Both [ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) and [Enjuxx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10727985) did a very good job mapping lots of creative difficulties which cater to different skill sets. Everyone can find a difficulty they enjoy, whether they are a really good player or a novice — as the difficulty variety in this set is huge. The star rating can be a bit misleading sometimes due to some of the gimmicks used, so beware that maps with a low star rating are not necessarily easy.

Honestly, I encourage everyone to just go in-game and try some of the diffs yourself. Words can't describe how much effort went into this mapset and it is such an experience to play through the set. You will surely have a good time!

Alright, alright, so we have three Korean picks this week, *mais* we also have a French one (yay to diversity)! It has been a little over two years since we last featured Kyuare, so it is high time we return to one of their creations.

Clocking in at just under 6\*, the map is quite a bit easier compared to our other picks this week. However, back in its day, this map was considered to be quite hard. One can expect a typical, fairly smooth Kyuare experience here, as they were one of the pioneers of more "flowy" mapping back in those days. Do you find it a tad too easy? Just slap some Hard Rock on this baby and enjoy the wiggles then!

But yeah, here's to a classic map. Nothing too crazy and only two minutes long, but the combination of this song and our beloved Kyuare might just be enough to make a grown-up cry (or maybe not).

[RoughSketch - 666](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1116525#fruits/2332430) is one of the more iconic recent maps from him, which is proving to be a good challenge to FC for high-end players, while also being a good map for players to improve their speed on. Your fingers better be ready as this map is unrelenting in its speedy wiggles throughout the whole 2 minutes. Don't ease up at the end, because it gets even harder at the final burst!

Will you be able to keep up?

After nearly 3 years, a new map hosted by Rocma makes its entry in the Loved section this month, being one of the [2020 osu!catch Mapping World Cup](/wiki/Contests/oBWC/2)'s winning team entries, *Sulyvahn*, mapped as a collaboration between [Rocma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276) and [Roxy Migurdia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2241910)!

This map is quite challenging, so you better be ready. One hell of a tech and speed map is crammed within a 4-minute window, providing an amazing package of a challenge to play and attempt to FC.

I hope you're ready for this.

While the tournament spotlight is currently focused on recent entries such as [Chroma - Test Flight](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1918273#mania/3958439) from the [4 Digit Mania World Cup 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1671710), we will be looking at more of an old classic: *Contact*.

*Contact* was historically used in a multitude of tournaments as a memory-oriented SV pick: the two difficulties, "Otherworldly" and "TerrestriaL", feature the exact same gimmicks. The key difference is that "Otherworldly" is a cut version, more fit as an easier, shorter test of learning abilities, whereas "TerrestriaL" covers the full 3:44 runtime with a pretty challenging second half. As a result, the latter has been more fit as sort of a final boss–type of a pick while still keeping the skill ceiling fairly reasonable.

Do not lose contact: support Orca-'s second Loved entry by voting in the thread!

As per usual, we have our monthly jack pick! This time around, by the hands of [Elementaires](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2284328). While technically not new to Project Loved given their participation in [Moe Shop's <3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/502203#mania/1111137), this is their first standalone pick.

People who have been in the community for a while may recall that this map was featured in the [osu!mania 4K World Cup 2018](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2018_4K#round-of-16). Time flies, doesn't it? Ever since then, it has garnered its fair share of popularity. For those who aren't aware of the chart, it's a run-of-the-mill, very varied and easy-going jack beatmap! While mostly chordjack, it plays around with several other ideas, which makes it all the more fun with rates while you jump from one segment to another, adapting your playstyle in the process.

We hope that the resurgence of a legacy chart as a chordjack pick is well received. As always, please let us know so we know what the community most expects moving on!

Guess this is what they call an "oldie but a goldie". [DrLou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13472706) is back with us in Project Loved. This time around though, not with a 7K set but a 4K one instead. What prompted us to do such a thing? Their *najimi breakers* set has not only gained quite the popularity, but the spread as a whole is a huge blast!

Being a spread, expect difficulty to scale in a somewhat linear fashion. This set is accessible to everyone! And while its topmost difficulty is not a high-end chart for 4K standards, it's still a very well-crafted difficulty that most people who get to play it will enjoy. The set follows the breakcore rhythm quite faithfully, and as you crank the difficulty up a notch, the density will slowly creep its way up. The [Break difficulty](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1163908#mania/2719212) offers fun jumpstream segments with trickier, more dense technical bits. There's a bit of everything in store for players.

Given the feedback we've been receiving, we've decided potentially having an extra permanent slot for legacy/popular beatmaps. Let us know how the idea sounds, and if this was a good choice to premiere this new slot with!

It's been a while since we've seen [Phil](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3191489) or [Xay](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/961417) around Loved. After 5 and 4 years respectively, we'd like to welcome them back! And what better set to do this with than their interpretation on *Terminal 11 - Counter Clockwise Chant Pattern*.

Don't be too fooled, however. Both difficulties are the same, structure-wise that is. The difference is that [Xay's version](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/659039#mania/3182141) adds some very short long notes to make sure players are keeping their trigger fingers on point. Suffice to say, make sure to release the notes as quickly as possible! Anyway, the rest of the chart is as uncomfortable and fun as you can get with Terminal 11's works! Quirky, weird rhythms, and even quirkier, weirder patterns. The combination of these two makes this tech set quite fun if you're into it.

We hope that our returning couple of mappers has a good impression on the community!

It has been a while since we last saw [AlexDunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9194799) featured in Project Loved, but the wait wasn't for naught. Another set of theirs has slowly been gaining traction during that period of time, even getting some final touches here and there to get it on its best shape possible! That's why this month around, we'll be featuring their amazing *Aegleseeker* set.

But what can players expect? For starters, you can get to experience an amazing storyboard crafted by none other than [lovely_hyahya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10318380). Alternatively, if storyboards aren't your thing, the background was AlexDunk's own doing, so you'll still have something fancy to stare at!

The set also offers [a standalone SV difficulty](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1463567#mania/3042821), for those who'd like to get the vibe of the song through wacky speed-ups and slow-downs. The other three difficulties are all distinct with ever-so-slight increases in difficulty. Give them a try! Each one of them holds itself just as well as a standalone chart.

This is by far AlexDunk's most ambitious project yet as far as we're able to tell. Giving them a chance to feature their set is the least we could do. We hope the community likes it as much as we did.

[Hylotl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18270260) was probably one of the most popular LN mappers of 2022, and it didn't come for nothing. He has provided both rice and LN players with a wealth of useful practice maps over the years.

So, after discussion, we decided to pick out the best and most famous maps from his LN pack collections and make them Loved. Hylotl's LN pack series mainly includes LN density and full LN, but also includes other types of LN maps such as release and technical. From extremely difficult to very easy, there is always a map on which you can practice.

After accumulating a lot of plays and praise from the community, some of these maps have been selected for use in well-known tournaments, such as [Silentroom - Shuu no Hazama](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1939237#mania/4009279) in the [osu!mania LN Tournament 3](/wiki/Tournaments/o!mLN/3).

If you like this pack, check out Hylotl's profile page for more maps. Of course, don't forget to cast your vote!

*Influencer* is also a rice chart, but with special focus on bracket patterns. These will accompany you all throughout the song, picking up in density in the chorus sections with a couple of full-density bursts. Don't get thrown off by the surprise jacks in the ending section!

If the base rate of 132 BPM is too easy for you, the set includes rates up to 1.4x, which is great for practicing consistency on the tricky patterns. So, do you like catchy J-pop? VTubers? Brackets? kasumi99? If the answer to any (or all) of those questions is yes, make it known in the poll now!

This is an older-style set, and you will definitely notice some differences in the way charts were created back then.

With the exception of Jinjin's chart, the whole set is geared towards low-level LN patterning. This is as straightforward as it gets, and you will find simple patterns to enjoy the song with as you play through them. We have not seen a nomination of a low-level spread like this in quite some time (let alone for both 4K and 7K), and we hope you will enjoy this set regardless of your skill level or your preferred key mode.

If you want to see more sets like this in Loved, don't forget to give Remillion Cross and the rest of the guest difficulty creators your support.

[Leeju](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18219603)'s *Alice in Reitouko* chart has been a much-requested pick for a while now, and it is finally appearing in the Loved voting stage! While a cut version of this saw use in the Finals pool of [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_7K#finals), that is only a small point relative to the chart's overall popularity. We believe you will get the most value out of the full song and chart, so we are skipping the MWC difficulty.

As for the chart itself, this is one of those charts with a wide variety of LN patterns. As is expected of some O2Jam-style charts, you will find something new in every lyrical phrase and every section. The quality of patterning and the overall approachability of this chart makes the perfect recipe for continued popularity.

With that in mind, we introduce [\_IceRain](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7859973) to the Loved voting stage with his *6K Advanced Collection*!

\_IceRain's *6K Advanced Collection* is a pack designed for players who've improved enough to have a need for playing harder charts. As always with these packs, ignore the star rating as that is not a real determinant of difficulty here. Use the numbers indicated in each difficulty name instead to get a feel for the true difficulty of each chart.

With a whopping 35 charts in this pack, there is a wide variety of regular, long-note, and mixed patternings to practice with. If you want to see more 6K in the Loved section, make sure to give \_IceRain your vote.
