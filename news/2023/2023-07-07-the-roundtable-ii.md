**The Roundtable II** takes the concept behind [last year's prototype tournament](/wiki/Tournaments/The_Roundtable) and raises the bar tenfold.

This **3-day** event from **July 7–9** features **2 major tournaments** and a bundle of side events, all streamed from [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691)'s [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/BTMC)!

### 16-player battle royale

Before diving into the main event, players will be warming up their competitive drives with a **16-player battle royale**!

The LAN setup has 8 computers, so players will be split into two groups of 8. Each group will play **7 maps** in a multiplayer lobby, and whoever scores the lowest on each map will be eliminated.

Once both groups have been narrowed down to a single player, the finalists will face head to head in a **best-of-13 competition!**

### 1v1 double-elimination tournament

Everything is on the line for **The Roundtable II**'s main event: a **double-elimination 1v1 tournament**!

This tournament will last two days:

| Day | Brackets |
| --: | :-- |
| Day 2 | Round of 16, Quarterfinals |
| Day 3 | Semifinals, Finals, Grand Finals |

Witness osu!'s top players duke it out *in person* for unending glory. (And cool prizes, of course.)

### Side events

While tournaments are the big attractions for this weekend's event, there's more in store! A variety of small events will be hosted in downtime between or after tournament matches, showcasing osu! players in more than their exclusive circle-clicking habitat.
