And to celebrate, we have medals. Love 'em. Can't get enough of 'em. Now, you can get even more of 'em!

We're confident 2024 will be a big year for osu!, so while the development team is busy [turning on performance point leaderboards in osu!(lazer)](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-12-18-osulazer-updates-preparing-for-ranked-play) and mappers (probably other people too) are excited over [yesterday's t+pazolite Featured Artist announcement](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-12-23-new-featured-artist-tpazolite), we're releasing **8 new medals**, one every day starting today on December 24th and lasting until January 1st.

These are "Hush-Hush" medals (you can tell because they're purple). Unlike regular ones, they're only attainable by decrypting a set of hints viewable when hovering over them on your profile page.

Each new medal will be released at around 14:00 UTC, and there are a few ways to get notified and involved:

- This news post will be updated every day. Keep it bookmarked!
- The [@osugame Twitter account](https://twitter.com/osugame) will be posting each new medal.
- Discussion threads will be posted in [this forum discussion hub](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1861054). We encourage working together to solve these medals!

Additionally, there will be an [**osu!supporter**](/wiki/osu!supporter) reward of 1 month for each player who first unlocks a medal from this batch.

So, what are you waiting for? Let's get into today's medal!
