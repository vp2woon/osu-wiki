Let's practice a back-and-forth exercise. We'll introduce a new Featured Artist to you, and you'll create a beatmap of one of their songs.

Now it's your turn.

Once you're done, make sure you keep an eye on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for another artist next week, and maybe track `#featured-artists` in the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) if you want feedback on your maps!
