Are you an avid skin creator who makes skins from scratch, or someone who makes remixed skins for fun? Maybe you just like collecting unique skins and exploring what the community has to offer? Let us know your thoughts in a short skinning-related survey!

With skinning continuously evolving, we've made a survey through which the community can let us know how they feel about the current state of the skinning scene and help us better understand the community's expectations and needs.

The link below will lead you to the survey page. While most questions are not mandatory to answer, the more feedback we receive, the easier it will be for us to make changes you want to see come to life.

[**Click here to take the survey!**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEtYo-uxu-uSS7S3C_y7DV-EZWY47dfg9-YpUuThu8belCQw/viewform)

The survey should only take a couple of minutes to complete, so be sure to pass the news along to any of your friends that might be interested in skinning!

For those who wish to further engage with the skinning community, please feel free to take a look at the [skinning tutorial](https://skinship.xyz/tutorial/introduction) or check out the [skinning forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/15)!

There is currently no set date for the announcement of the survey results, but when we think the results are ready, we'll let you know via the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) with a write-up posted on the [skinning forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/15) for everyone to read at their leisure.
