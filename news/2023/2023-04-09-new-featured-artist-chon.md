## Sharing your Featured Artist maps

We've opened the new `#featured-artists` channel in the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) to highlight new maps made by the community for Featured Artists!

To start, this hub will be used for two things:

  1. **Quick map feedback:** Anyone who posts new Featured Artist maps in the server will receive quick feedback from *pishifat* (that's me) or anyone else who wants to contribute!
  2. **Usage in [osu!(lazer) Featured Artist playlists](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists):** Link your maps from recently announced Featured Artists to be considered for playlists in osu!(lazer) next month. Once the playlists are published, the top-scoring players on the playlist leaderboards can potentially **earn a profile badge**!

More details about all of this can be found on the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy), so give that a visit if you're at all interested (or if you just want another osu! server in your never-ending server list).

That's all for now!

We have another artist planned for the middle of next week, so stay tuned to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for every little detail.
