Summoning all mappers! Friendly and fun-loving demon queen **Ironmouse** joins forces with everyone's favourite osu! streamer **BTMC** for a new type of mapping competition, all based around the new hit **Ironmouse & Camellia - Waifu Jam**!

For those out of the loop, [**Ironmouse**](https://www.youtube.com/@IronMouseParty) is an American VTuber known for her exceptional singing skills and an unbridled, energetic personality. Partnered with VShojo, she confidently aims to sing her heart out for the world to hear, and [**Waifu Jam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdWGBirRpDs) is proof of that!

By the way, the demon queen herself will gladly offer a **$1000 cash prize** to the winner of this contest... but you didn't hear that from us.

## Format

Mappers, don't get it twisted. This isn't your everyday mapping contest with the usual set of judges and criteria benchmarks. Pfft! This time, **you can be the judge!**

After a preliminary screening phase, the **top 16** submissions will be placed in a 1v1 tournament-style bracket to compete live on [**BTMC**'s stream](https://www.twitch.tv/btmc). From there, it'll be up to the community to vote and decide which maps proceed through the bracket!

Each stage of the bracket will focus on a different section of the map:

| Bracket stage | Beatmap section |
| --: | :-- |
| Round of 16 | 00:00 to 00:44 |
| Quarterfinals | 00:44 to 01:22 |
| Semifinals | 01:22 to 01:50 |
| Grand Finals | 01:50 to 02:47 |

Because of this format, you'll need to create a map where each of these sections stands out individually!

## Submission

Entries can be submitted for about 2 weeks from this announcement, so get mapping! The demon queen waits for no one.
