If you happened to miss last weekend's [osu!catch World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2023) Grand Finals, you not only missed South Korea's thrilling turnaround after their 7–5 defeat against the United States, but also the **five brand-new songs** created exclusively for the event.

Those [**osu! originals**](/wiki/osu!_originals) were painstakingly produced by both new and veteran artists for [2023's osu!catch World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2023), so check out the songs for yourself (...and maybe map one, if you're into that sort of thing):

### [LV.4 - Chemical Diving](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2026273)

Back for their third world cup in a row, [**LV.4**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/214) is practically a permanent resident of our official tournaments (which is a good thing, obviously).

[Chemical Diving](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2026273) by [Rocma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276) and [Du5t](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6053071) slotted in as a *Hard Rock* pick for the [Finals mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2023#finals), and proved itself as a testing ground for this year's strongest teams. In the decisive round showcased above, the US barely overtook South Korea by a slim 17,000 points!

### [Toromaru - Erinyes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2000438)

Deviating from their usual jazzy sound, [**Toromaru**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/279) brings a new take on a classic rhythm game style to this year's osu!catch World Cup.

[Erinyes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2000438) mapped by [autofanboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114) was found in the *Hard Rock* category for the [Quarterfinals mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2023#quarterfinals), and in a few seconds, it'll be found in your beatmap library.

### [MYUKKE. - Anti Safety Zone](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2004086)

A master of their vocal-chopping craft, [**MYUKKE.**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/121) returns to the forefront of osu! with [Anti Safety Zone](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2004086) mapped by [GiGas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7300747) and [-Ken](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4430811) — a *Hidden* pick in the [Semifinals mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2023#semifinals)!

### [kanemiko - Cold Fusion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2011522)

While [**kanemiko**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/367) may not have been an osu! Featured Artist directly up until now, their music has already serenaded osu! through [HARDCORE UTOPIA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/205).

Specifically, their track [Electrolytes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1774562) became an icon in the osu!catch world, inspiring [Cold Fusion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2011522) mapped by [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134) and [Zyzyx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2888013). This *No Mod* pick was also the opener for the [Grand Finals mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2023#grand-finals)!

### [Halv vs. kuro - Evreka](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2011570)

Just like **kanemiko**, both [**Halv**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/368) and [**kuro**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/369) have been indirectly featured on other artists' listings: **Halv** with a few tunes on [HARDCORE UTOPIA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/205) and **kuro** with *Message From the Dystopia: Dear UtopiA* on [rN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/190)'s listing.

[Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883), [Deif](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/318565), [Greaper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2369776), [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134), [Rocma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276), [autofanboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114), [Kyuare](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2705312), and [Yumeno Himiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1806962) put their souls into [Evreka](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2011570), the **[Grand Finals](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2023#grand-finals) tiebreaker**, capping out at an unreal **9.37 stars**. Props to everyone involved for creating a special climax for this year's osu!catch World Cup!
