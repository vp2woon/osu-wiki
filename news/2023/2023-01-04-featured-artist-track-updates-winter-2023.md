Your New Year's resolution is to learn how to map, right? We've picked up over **60** new songs from **18** of our Featured Artists for you to try out!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/featured-artist.jpg)

We announce new Featured Artists twice a week. Artists never stop producing music though, so we sometimes pick up songs from our backlog of artists. This post is a compilation of every new song we've licensed since [our batch last summer](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-07-02-featured-artist-track-updates-summer-2022).

Here's how this works: **click on an artist's name or banner to visit their Featured Artist page**. All new songs are marked with a slick *NEW* icon, which contractually obligates you to map them.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-01-02-featured-artist-track-updates-winter-2022/new.png)

New songs are also listed below along with any relevant Ranked/Loved maps and an audio preview or two. These should give you a quick impression of what's in store, but also remember that all song previews are available from each Featured Artist page!

## [DJ Raisei](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/204)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/204/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/204)

This year's osu! World Cup received a lot of love from our Featured Artists, like **DJ Raisei** and his new osu! original song *T.R.A.P.*!

### DJ Raisei - T.R.A.P. <!-- lint ignore no-heading-punctuation -->

## [Good Kid](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/240)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/240/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/240)

**Good Kid** makes good music. It hasn't been long since their release on osu!, so they've only had one new song released, and we've added it to their listing!

### Good Kid - No Time to Explain

## [II-L](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/172)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/172/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/172)

**II-L**'s songs dive into rhythmic territory that no other musicians dare to explore. With complexity like this, you'd never believe that **II-L**'s music could have vocals. In their osu! original for the recent osu! World Cup, *THE EARTH* shows that it's... somehow possible!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/35/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/35)

If there's anything that the osu! audience loves more than a certain three-digit number, it's **Imperial Circus Dead Decadence**. This Japanese death metal band has made an astounding impact on the osu! community thanks to songs like [Uta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/410162) and [Yomi yori](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/575330), and we're here to slam their newest album down your ear-holes. In classic ICDD fashion (i.e. very long), that album's name is *MOGARI - Shi e Fukeru Omoi wa Rikujoku Sura Kurai, Kanata no Sei o Aisuru Tame ni Inoti o Tataeru*.

Considering **Sephid** joined osu! thanks to [a map from OWC 2020](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1189616), it's only appropriate that their newest tune comes straight from osu! World Cup 2022.

This oriental-styled batch of songs showcases some of **Street**'s strongest production talents, along with a re-imagined version of his classic song [Sakura Fubuki](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/362989).

Congrats on scrolling all the way down here! After experiencing so much music, you'll be happy to know that there's a whole bunch more on the way.

We release new Featured Artists every Wednesday and Saturday, but we'll be changing the script with some new ways of announcing artists this year!

Stay tuned. We have a *lot* in store.
