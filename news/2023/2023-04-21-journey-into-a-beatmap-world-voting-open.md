**105** brave artists took the plunge into probably our most thematically challenging art contest yet! We've also made about that many isekai references throughout the promotion for this contest as it stands, so we'll try to stop now.

The results are *stunning* to say the least, and what better way to see what's up than with a trusty showcase video courtesy of pishifat, set to the tunes of one of the OG Featured Artists, [dark cat](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/6):

[**Click here to go straight to the voting for the Journey into a Beatmap World Art Contest!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/175)

The vote will be up for only **7 days** from the date of this post, so be sure to swoop in swiftly and make your choices known. Fantasy worlds wait for nobody, after all!

A selection from the top-voted entries will make it to the game's main menu as the Journey into a Beatmap World seasonal backgrounds, and their creators will score themselves 3 months of osu!supporter.

The top 3 voted entries will earn themselves a unique profile badge sampled from their own creation, so they can proudly point at their profiles and declare yes, they made this. Quite literally.

A huge thank you to everyone who took the time to participate! We acknowledge that really stringent themes like this can be super challenging at times, so the next art contest for the year will be something a bit more casual to help break things up. Hoping to see you then!

Now, if you'll excuse the rest of us, we have to set out to battle the final boss: picking only so many of these absurdly talented artworks.
