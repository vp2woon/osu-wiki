Melding together breakcore, noise, progressive rock, and VOCALOID, **kaitendaentai**'s  music is anything but normal. And you'll like it.

A lot of rhythm game musicians are influenced by other rhythm game musicians. Japanese producer **kaitendaentai**, on the other hand, draws inspiration from all sorts of creators, ranging from insane breakcore artists like [Venetian Snares](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/71) and [The Flashbulb](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/37) to classic rock and metal bands like *TOOL*, *Pink Floyd*, and *Nirvana*.

**8** of these difficult-to-describe tracks are now pre-timed and ready for mapping from [**kaitendaentai**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/364)!

Our osu!taiko community was first to discover **kaitendaentai**'s obscure sound, so watch how drum bashers handle this kind of music, then listen to the rest of what's available:
