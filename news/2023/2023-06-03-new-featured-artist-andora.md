**Andora**'s J-pop gems are now part of our Featured Artist collection. Try them out today (and maybe earn yourself a pretty profile badge) through the latest batch of Featured Artist playlists in osu!(lazer)!

While **Andora** has been producing pop/EDM tracks for nearly 10 years, they've only recently been noticed by the osu! community. In mid-2020, their track *Dawn* shifted **Andora**'s style to J-pop tunes that feature vocalists you've probably heard like *WaMi*, *RANASOL*, and *Such*.

**6** upbeat bops are ready for mapping thanks to the pre-timed beatmap templates on [**Andora**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/363)!

Curious what **Andora** sounds like? Try out one of the [**Featured Artist playlists**](#featured-artist-playlists) in osu!(lazer) or skip to some of the [**previews**](#previews) below!

## Featured Artist playlists

osu!(lazer) has a new multiplayer mode called **playlists**, which is basically a temporary competitive leaderboard for a series of maps.

With the help of mappers from the [Mappers' Guild](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild), we've set up some osu! and osu!mania [Featured Artist playlists](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists) covering **every artist released last month**, along with **Andora**.

These playlists are usually dominated by *certain players* (hello fieryrage), so we're opening up some alternative prizing for those who want to earn their own **Featured Artist playlist** profile badge:

![Featured Artist profile badge](/wiki/shared/news/2022-05-28-new-featured-artist-rameses-b/faplosu.png) ![Featured Artist profile badge](/wiki/shared/news/2022-05-28-new-featured-artist-rameses-b/faplmania.png)

Any player can earn one of these badges by achieving 10 points. These points carry over between all Featured Artist playlists, as seen in [this cumulative leaderboard](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists#cumulative-leaderboard).

| Playlist leaderboard rank | Points |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1st | **10** |
| 2nd | 5 |
| 3rd | 3 |
| 4-5th | 2 |
| 6-10th | 1 |

We'll be running these playlists once a month or two, so play each one and track your progress towards your profile badge on the [Featured Artist playlists wiki page](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists)! And in case you want to make a map for these playlists, [send pishifat a message](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418) (especially if you're an osu!taiko or osu!catch mapper!).

That's enough about playlists. Open up osu!(lazer) already or fill your ears with this:
