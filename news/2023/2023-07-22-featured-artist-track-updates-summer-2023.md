title: "Featured Artist Track Updates: Summer 2023"
date: 2023-07-22 14:00:00 +0000
---

Ever considered mapping **100** songs at once? Hopefully not, but that's about how many new songs are part of our Featured Artist library.

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/featured-artist.jpg)

Once a week, we announce a new Featured Artist... but today is a bit different.

Musicians never stop creating new music, so we're here to highlight some tracks from our older Featured Artists that haven't been released on osu! yet. Technically speaking, this article covers every newly licensed song from our backlog of artists since [this winter batch](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-01-04-featured-artist-track-updates-winter-2023)!

Skip to any Featured Artists in this article:

- [**BilliumMoto / Dictate**](#billiummoto-and-niu-arx-/-dictate)
- [**ELFENSJóN**](#elfensjon)
- [**Good Kid**](#good-kid)
- [**goreshit**](#goreshit)
- [**KOAN Sound**](#koan-sound)
- [**my sound life**](#my-sound-life)
- [**Pratanallis**](#pratanallis)
- [**Riya**](#riya)
- [**seatrus**](#seatrus)
- [**seleP**](#selep)
- [**solfa**](#solfa)
- [**Trial & Error**](#trial-&-error)
- [**Wisp X**](#wisp-x)

Songs marked with this fancy *NEW* icon are... new. (Hint: you should map these songs.)

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-01-02-featured-artist-track-updates-winter-2022/new.png)

New songs are also listed below along with any relevant Ranked/Loved maps and an audio preview or two. These should give you a quick impression of what's in store, but also remember that all song previews are available from each Featured Artist page!

## [BilliumMoto and niu arx / Dictate](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/38)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/38/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/38)

Original songs for tournament tiebreakers are everywhere these days, but we doubt you've seen a tournament like [Jaye's One Key Event 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1430912?n=1) — an osu! mania tournament where every map has... one key. It's ridiculous, and both [**BilliumMoto**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/38) and [**niu arx**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/21) (known as *Dictate* at the time) made the equally ridiculous song [**1KARUGA**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1649302) for its finale.

Oh, the song was also used as [the tiebreaker for TWC 2023's Finals mappool](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1976834). So that's cool.

### BilliumMoto & Dictate - 1KARUGA

## [ELFENSJoN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/69)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/69/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/69)

These **3** new songs by **ELFENSJoN** have the all the essentials of osu! music: high-paced gothic J-rock and the vocal mastery of veteran utaite *Hanatan*.

If that's not convincing already, you may need to reconsider your preferences.

### ELFENSJoN - DAWN

## [Good Kid](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/240)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/240/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/240)

**Good Kid**'s third EP of hype-filled upbeat rock was released earlier this year (aptly titled *Good Kid 3*). Since all of their already licensed songs are already mapped, it only made sense for us to snag **4** of their new tunes.

### Good Kid - Down With The King

## [goreshit](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/57)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/57/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/57)

Anyone who's taken a step into the breakcore realm has heard **goreshit**'s sound. They're a staple here on osu!, and we're happy to have an extra **3** tracks on their listing. There's more we could explain about this, but we'll leave it a mystery. For now. :)

## [KOAN Sound](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/49)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/49/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/49)

Another one of our founding Featured Artists, **KOAN Sound**, is back with **2** extra tracks to round out their catalogue. Both have a special place on osu!: [Strike](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/440827) was ranked by [Shiirn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/465126) back in 2016, while [Forgotten Myths](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/643984) has a classic map by [Mir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8688812). And both are worth your time.

## [my sound life](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/252)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/252/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/252)

**my sound life** is a side project of [**solfa**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/207), a legend in the realm of visual novel tracks. We've picked up **2** more songs for their listing, including the classic [re:construction](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/119431) mapped by [hoLysoup](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/160558) over 10 years ago!

## [Pratanallis](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/175)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/175/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/175)

Doujin circle **Pratanallis** brings symphonic rock and a wide collection of renowned vocalists together, and their latest album *Tears Nocturn* continues the trend. We've expanded their catalogue up to **2** more tracks, one of which was ranked just recently: [Crocus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1878262) mapped by [Melize](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10778215)!

If you thought this was a lot of songs for an individual artist's catalogue update, you're not ready for what's coming.

## [seleP](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/138)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/138/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/138)

Following the release of their latest album *BloodLine*, the composer behind "[the hardest map in osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/41686)" is back with **3** more VOCALOID masterpieces! Two come from that new album, and one more is from their backlog: [Snow Marriage](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1823014) ranked last year by [P_O](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/831979)!

So uh. This has never happened before. We're adding **over 50** to **solfa**'s library, nearly *tripling* their tracklist, including a bunch of songs with Ranked maps that we couldn't pick up before!

If the sound of *Chata*, *Rita*, *yuiko*, *nao*, *KOTOKO*, *Shimotsuki Haruka* or *Koharu Meu* ring a bell (which they obviously do), that means it's time to load up the editor:

## [Trial & Error](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/20)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/20/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/20)

**Trial & Error** makes a return with one more anime-inspired single **Shuuen no Reboot**, available in four different versions! You can figure out what that means for yourself by visiting their Featured Artist listing.

### Trial & Error - Shuuen no Reboot

## [Wisp X](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/16)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/16/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/16)

Featured Artist veteran **Wisp X** strikes back with **3** more tracks! These chill tunes are a divergence from the usual hyperintense rhythm game track, like [Coffee](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/733211) hosted by [Xinnoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4236057). If that sounds like your style, you're in luck.

If that's not enough music for you, you'll be happy to know that another Featured Artist is coming this Saturday. And another one the next week. And another one the week after. And... we'll let you guess what comes next.

Stay tuned.
