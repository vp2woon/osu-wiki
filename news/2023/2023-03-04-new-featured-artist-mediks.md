**Mediks** revives our Featured Artist library!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/346/header.jpg)

Producer trio **Mediks** isn't your ordinary electronic music unit. Specialising in an unorthodox offshoot of drum & bass, these producers spill out tracks that reach a special niche in both the EDM and osu! communities, best known to circle clickers by their million-play beatmap of [Outbreak](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/527082)!

**6** uncommon takes on drum & bass can be found on [**Mediks**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/346), including everything from their iconic *Outbreak* EP.

Sometimes we aren't permitted to promote Featured Artists alongside our usual gimmicky videos. This is one of those times.

Instead, you can preview *every track* on **Mediks**'s listing right here:

[**Mediks**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/346) has every song above and their pre-timed beatmap templates. It also looks way prettier than a news article, and that should be enough reason for you to check it out.

Once you're done with your **Mediks** map, you can rest. But only for a few days. Another artist will be announced this coming Wednesday on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame), so stay tuned.
