Dive into the bassy depths of our latest Featured Artist, **Dustvoxx**!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/386/header.jpg)

Since 2011, **Dustvoxx** has been cementing his sound into the ears of anyone with an ounce of music taste. His artist/producer/DJ career sprouted with Frenchcore and speedcore creations, eventually growing towards other genres that would be picked up by other rhythm games like *SOUND VOLTEX* and *Dance Dance Revolution*.

We could go on about **Dustvoxx** all day, but your time would better be spent mapping any of the **13** tunes from [**Dustvoxx**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/386)!
