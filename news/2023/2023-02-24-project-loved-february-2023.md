Come vote on this month's carefully curated selection of beatmaps for the Loved section!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

To those who're new to what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As always, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the January votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

Before continuing, we've got some important news to share with you from Project Loved HQ:

- As of the start of this year, the process of picking maps for Loved in the osu! game mode has been completely revamped, involving a streamlined set of beatmap categories, rules, and guidelines that mappers and captains need to follow. If you're interested to know more about what has changed, then consider reading [the Project Loved wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved).
- Ding ding! A delivery of *two* new Project Loved Team members has arrived! Featuring [Blushing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5927823), who will assist with making sure that all descriptions are clear from any sneaky blunders, and [Civil oath](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3216107), who will make sure that all backgrounds comply with osu!'s rules and standards. Please take a moment to give them a heartwarming welcome!
- Unfortunately, all good things come to an end, as we have to bid farewell to [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334). We want to thank him for his valuable contributions to the osu! Loved section, and we hope he enjoys the retirement home alongside our other veterans.
- On brighter news, this means that we'll be opening applications again for the the osu! game mode, so if you've ever wanted to be a part of promoting the community's most beloved beatmaps to an equally adored section, then this might be your chance! You can apply by filling out the form below:

This month's pick for the Popular Playcount category would be... the mega mapset [#1f1e33](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1192060#osu/2708971) hosted by [Realazy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/918297)!

Housing a lot of your favorite mappers and offering an abundance of challenging guest difficulties, Realazy and friends show you what the talk surrounding *real tehc mappin'* is all about. This set provides different takes from a number of mappers, offering an array of crazy patterns, blazingly fast sliders, and rhythms that will blow your mind. *#1f1e33* has it all. I don't think I need to say much more about it other than that it is a tech map overdose. I know this is a favorite among many of you (especially you, tournament mappoolers!), and it's quite obvious why. If you haven't tried these maps yet, it's time to see what all the fuss is about!

[Nanairo no Nico Nico Douga](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/16831#osu/1551754), mapped by [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983), [tieff](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/89619), [adam2046](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8358), [ignorethis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/27343), [Mashley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/41481), [Zatoichi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/35199), [Takuma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/43677), [Shinxyn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13996), [Gabi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/57057), [Lesjuh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/44308), [Wizard Of Orz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10466), [Neo@lex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4970), [DJPop](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2363), [LuigiHann](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1079), [DiamondCrash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/123790), [pieguyn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/107485), [Sallad4ever](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/185422), [Nachy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/95637), [Cristian](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/194345), [Derekku](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/91341), [Beuchi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/67192), [Shohei Ohtani](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/135630), [Emdyion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/190213), [Diasios](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25999), [Lilac](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/58197), [Kecco](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/172707), [Lybydose](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/64501), [Xgor](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/98661), and [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)... well, did I leave anyone out?

Anyway, this beatmap, as a spiritual sequel to classics such as [Ryuuseigun](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2459#osu/19753) and [Kumikyoku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/3636#osu/22240), is a trip through the memes and references of another world, more specifically the 2000's internet culture from Japan. And what better way to go to the past than gathering some of the most beloved classic mappers (plus that Mismagius guy)? Don't let the play count deceive you — this was one of the most well-known graveyarded maps of early osu! history, and most of its time in the spotlight was in an era before play count was a thing in non-ranked maps.

Voting yes on this is voting for the proper highlighting and archival of osu! history, and I can't think of a better way to achieve that in the Loved section with *Nanairo no Nico Nico Douga*.

This month's Small Spectacle is a collab between [rrtyui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/352328) and [thzz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1614839), *Widowmaker - Giselle*.

The song's absolutely absurd dance between classical and intense electronic is represented to the extreme within this map. With ludicrously fast sliders and alt mixed with 1/6 rhythms in a frequently changing BPM, it crafts a uniquely challenging and beautiful experience. With only 2,600 plays and 50 favourites after 4 years in the graveyard, this Small Spectacle truly deserves some time in the light. Make sure not to miss this one!

The Daredevil Difficulty for this month is [Dereban](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4882979)'s very well-known alt aim fiasco of Rihanna's *Work*.

[Dereban](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4882979) is mainly known for being one of the best in the world at playing the game, but he is also an outstanding mapper. Matching his skill level, this map represents the top of top-tier gameplay. At an 8.88 star rating, this map is packed in the raw aim department, testing things like agility, slider aim and even snap aim. It feels like you have to put in a lot of *Work* in to be able to play this map. This song and map are very popular throughout the osu! community, featured many times through social media (Twitter, TikTok and YouTube), making it gather a lot of popularity over the years.

You may want to check out some of the scores set on this map, such as [FunOrange](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2051389)'s [liveplay](https://youtu.be/hmRzNkQ7kiE), [WhiteCat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101)'s [1x sb liveplay](https://youtu.be/4t9LNsyQcFs), and [Vaxei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4787150)'s [1st FC](https://youtu.be/5PTLVVN2hkM).

The Ranked Reject for this month is [VINXIS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4323406)'s mapset of nao's *Towa naru Kizuna to Omoi no Kiseki* featuring a whopping 9\* top diff by [Taeyang](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2732340), and a full spread with many iconic names from the likes of [RLC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1047883), [Okoratu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405), [Mint](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2407160), [Left](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5062061), [N a s y a](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1473106), [Silky](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5069490) and [Natsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1953876). If that doesn't scream peak 2015/16 mapping, I don't know what does.

VINXIS and Taeyang's return to the Loved section has been long awaited, and I bring you a spicy one after their long hiatus. Anyone who's a fan of alt-esque maps will absolutely love this mapset. It has a difficulty for all skill levels — just like a Ranked Reject that meets these requirements should! This map has been sitting in graveyard/pending for about 7 years now, and every now and again there's an update making everyone think this is finally going for ranked again, but as VINXIS himself said he no longer has motivation to push this for ranked. So for the first ever Ranked Reject, I think there is no better choice than this wonderful mapset.

Do you think we should finally give this mapset a leaderboard? Vote now!

This month's pick for the Chill Champions category is [Monstrata](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2706438)'s [DAYBREAK FRONTLINE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/779226#osu).

I'm sure most of you have already heard at some point of the fabled "Monstrata alternator maps", and here is one in its natural habitat. With a multitude of carefully constructed patterns following variable rhythms throughout this beautiful song, it's no wonder it was one of the most requested beatmaps for the Loved section ever since it was submitted back in 2018. It's also worth noting that due to the fact that the mapset uses different .mp3 files, it cannot be ranked without losing a lot of what makes it special. Take your time to try both of the top difficulties, and check which one you like the most! ...I guess.

The first Wildcard for this month is a set involving [PotatoDew](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10964252), [wafer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9416836) and [MoistSlurp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12785594), *bbno$ & Rich Brian - edamame*.

Generally a rare genre to find within osu!, this English hip hop set embodies the goofy nature of the song. The top difficulty accomplishes that especially, with fairly challenging awkward aim that's not afraid to fit the full playfield. If you wish to play something easier, the nerfed version — a collab between [PotatoDew](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10964252) and [wafer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9416836) — as well as the  Easy diff by [MoistSlurp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12785594) are all great fun, with the collab specifically providing a unique experience, using many SV changes. The set is all great fun, so I hope you can find something to enjoy within!

The second Wildcard for this month is... [Drizzling Sun](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/577770#osu/1584957) mapped by [Leiwa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1746675) (previously known as Urushi38)!

Rediscovering this map felt like a gift — like a hidden gem that I'd undug after quite a while. Sitting at 7.4\* and full of almost 4 minutes of intense CS 4.6 jumps, bursts and alternating patterns, Leiwa manages to gracefully craft a map of *Drizzling Sun* without being shy of its aggressively cheerful and energetic sounds, making you feel like you want to dance around on a beach. Everything in this map is just... \*chef's kiss\*.

I don't know what else to say other than the fact that this map is purely amazing — so you better hurry, take my word for it, and try the map out now!

*DITHER TUNE* is a collaboration between [uone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5321719) and [Shallty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6205471), which truly evokes the old days when Vocaloid songs were most popular, and many taiko mappers took their chance to bring in such catchy tunes.

This also holds true for the beatmap itself, as it is mostly a simple Oni difficulty that doesn't include 1/6 trills or long streams, just simple and fair patterning that will surely be pleasant to play for those who are in the process of learning to play Oni difficulties. Have fun!

This set features rate-changed difficulties ranging from 1.0x–1.25x, including multiple double-BPM sections at 150–188 BPM making it an ultimate speed challenge. This should definitely interest a very broad audience, covering intermediate speed players and the best of the best alike. Ready to test your hands' limits?

Here is a [Yuuyu - Howdy! and... Good-Die!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/974134#taiko/2039122) made by one of the leading mappers in Japan, [tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767).

This map is an UNDERTALE song and was used in the Finals week 2 tiebreaker of the [osu!taiko World Cup 2019](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2019). [namaniku](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2680544)'s [map of this song](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/551632) was loved 4 years ago, but the difficulty level is so high that it's impossible to be compared to that map, and I think this was a very suitable map to decorate TWC's Grand Finale. The bar lines, BPM changes, and other gimmicks are great, along with the map just being a lot of fun to play.

It is also a map for advanced players with a SR of 8.25. Why not try go for the S rank?

We've slowly seen how maps with sped-up diffs become popular in osu!taiko as people begin to break their limits on handling speed maps.

It's unbelievable that we haven't already featured [DJKurara - Donk Array](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1286476#taiko), which clocks at 240 BPM on its base difficulty, becoming quite tiring as it is highly stamina-heavy and has an exquisite variety of patterns ranging from pretty conventional ones to ones quite unusual and difficult to hit properly, making it fairly challenging for unsuspecting players who might want to study these before jumping onto the faster difficulties. Since those rise as high as 288 BPM, that means it'll be pretty hard to clear even for high-level players. Have fun!

It is quite difficult to see really high-quality reggaeton maps and it couldn't have been made by anyone other than [Ulqui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1263669), this time including his usual SV-heavy mapping to provide a fun experience to a song that would be otherwise very difficult to make a good map out of. He has done an incredible job at it however, since it serves as a good entry-level beatmap for players looking to learn SV reading with patterns that are quite easy to hit and predictable due to how repetitive the rhythm is. Truly a piece of art!

Those of you who have been in the community for a few years or participated in tournaments likely already know [Knife Party (Final Sketch Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/801653#taiko) and just how brutal the Dysthymia difficulty is. A collaboration between mapping powerhouses [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861) and [Ulqui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1263669), the map features long 1/4 229 BPM patterns with dense and complex 1/6 sections interlaced as well as some very tricky doublet patterns. For those that find the "tech" aspects of Dysthymia overwhelming, Ulqui's Inner Oni is a perfect fit, as this difficulty features no 1/6 or 1/8 patterning while still being a very good challenge. Good luck!

Featuring easier-level hyperwalks near the end (a common gimmick you see within the Loved section), it has potential to be fun for both experienced and inexperienced players. It is an excellent beginning point for beginners looking to expand their skillset as well.

So, do you want this to have a leaderboard?

This beatmap is one of the two older maps in this month's Loved rotation. However, it's quite different to the other pick. The map's old style of mapping, combined with the low approach rate of 8.3 and the circle size of 5, will surely give some trouble to newer and older players alike.

While this is not a full beatmap set and just a single difficulty, it should still provide you with a very fun map to play with all the various patterns that progressively get harder to hit.

It is very likely you have some memory of it if you're an osu!catch player, with the set having achieved 20,000 plays over the years, and various difficulties picked in tournaments. Most notably, the top difficulty was a Double Time pick back in the 3rd edition of the [Double Adept Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1153348?n=1) in 2020!

Many SV enthusiasts know DJ WITCH GIRL MIR4CLEN for bringing us [Mafain](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1569493) among many other "SVable" tunes and remixes. [\[Fairy\]Phy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4777360)'s chart of *who do you love* is another popular map that takes advantage of the bombastic and iconic drops that DJ WITCH GIRL MIR4CLEN has made themselves known and infamous for.

\[Fairy\]Phy is better known as an SV-oriented player from Japan, carrying their osu!mania World Cup team many times alongside names such as [CrewK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11488604) and [inteliser](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1824775). Many SV players have contributed back to the community through learning how to create their own SV maps — \[Fairy\]Phy is one such case, and *who do you love* is a good example of player insight providing an enjoyable experience.

The execution of the drops are very flashy and demanding of memorization — this is probably good content you can learn for your local talent show if you need to. The teleports and rhythms will take you a little while to learn, but no worries, you can try and get a feel for them through grinding the NSV difficulty.

However, the question here isn't exactly *who* do you love, but *which maps* do you love. Make sure you answer that question through voting in the respective threads.

Given the overwhelming support this mapset has, I believe it needs no further introduction.

My guess is that most players in the community would not reject a high-producing mapper with consistent quality. This guy has contributed hundreds of practice-worthy maps and packs since 2020.

This map is also the best pick for himself, as a stage summary of his unique dump patterns. Anyway, let's look forward to more of his work, and for more undiscovered mappers to be Loved.

[MyZterioN-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8521723) shows up in the polls again, this time around with a chart of theirs whose style is not what most players would've expected. It does not contain noodles... and no, the 76 of them do not make it a hybrid chart. Only a healthy dose of rice!

But let's get to it, shall we? Players can expect a varied array of vocal dumpstreams, where its intensity is periodically accentuated by the different textures of the guitars that come and go. A very dynamic experience that isn't forced to be rigid by the flexible nature of the concept follows. Even while playing, the flow can be felt.

We welcome you to give this style of map a try! From there, it's now in your hands to decide this map's eligibility for Loved. And hey, maybe that gives us a reference of whether you're a noodle or rice enjoyer.

Their mapping catalogue is incredibly small, culminating to a mere total of three (3) maps at the time of writing. Nevertheless, we are featuring their LN map of *Heart Forecast* in this wave of Loved entries.

The map itself, dating from 2020, has amassed enough attention from past tournaments, including [Speed of Light 2](/wiki/Tournaments/SOL/2020)'s Round of 32. Its entry-level LN map design has made it an attractive choice for newer players looking to improve their skills while also enjoying a popular song. A number of seasoned players will find this entry to be quite nostalgic, bringing back memories of once being a long note newbie. If you are still learning long notes, I do recommend you check this map out.

This description is being written a few days after Valentine's day, and I just noticed this is the second love-related osu!mania entry in this wave. Did you enjoy your Valentine's day? Do you enjoy this pick? Please tell us about it in the thread comments and (fore)cast your vote!

*LN Practice Pack 1* is one of a few sets of charts Kim_GodSSI created in order to help people practice inverse long notes. There are not many 7K charts in the Loved category (or with leaderboards in general) solely dedicated to this skill. It is said that inverse LN (also known as full LN) is the building block of all LN skillsets in general. If you learn how to play inverse well, you will be able to master all other LN skillsets as well.

Be advised that the overall difficulty of the charts in this pack is quite high. Having a dedicated high-level 7K inverse nomination is something that has often been requested from players of this caliber, and we are finally here to deliver. osu!mania 7K Loved needs more inverse, so if you agree with this and want to see more in the future, do not forget to cast your vote for *LN Practice Pack 1*.

*description written by [kadoen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12780575)*

Around 2014 and 2015, a BMS player known as MKTR made a large amount of charts in an unusual key mode for the game — 10K2S, or 10 keys + 2 scratches. This "emulates" the original beatmania controls (5 keys + 1 scratch/turntable), but controlling one with each hand, known as Double Play. This was an unusual key mode (since BMS and beatmania as a whole had mostly been 7K+1 for a decade), and the charts made by MKTR were never popular or played much, with most of them having only 5-10 players submitting scores.

In mid-late 2015, the legendary 10K pioneer [CircusGalop](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6660735) converted the charts made by MKTR to osu!mania, removing the scratch lanes and packaging them into 9 large packs. Over the years, these became very popular among the small amount of people playing 10K due to their accessibility and range in difficulty, providing a large amount of charts to a key mode that barely existed when they were uploaded.

The 10K community, although still quite small, has since grown to be a very passionate group. They're always ready to advertise and propagate this "all fingers" key mode, and with their inclusion into the ranking criteria in 2021, the 10K pool is now larger than ever. With MKTR having no osu! presence, however, it was not feasible to give a leaderboard to these popular charts — until now.

Last year, permission was obtained from MKTR directly, and now the time has come for the vote. Here, we offer a selection of 50 charts from those original packs, handpicked for their quality/popularity/accessibility by the 10K community — in a full range of difficulty, from beginner 1\* to expert 6\*.

Will the vote succeed? Will these maps step out of the mania graveyard and enter Loved? It's now or never — and only you can decide!
