If a loud sound pierces your ear drums, your hearing will be permanently damaged.

If you listen to **Sound piercer** loud enough to pierce your ear drums, your hearing will still be permanently damaged, but at least you'll enjoy the process.

**8** tunes that'll vibrate your inner ears juuuust right are now ripe for the picking from [**Sound piercer**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/334)!

[Hanatachi ni Kibou o](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=%22Hanatachi%20ni%20Kibou%20o%22) is **Sound piercer**'s claim to fame here on osu!, somehow receiving Ranked maps from *seven* different mappers throughout the last few years! Watch how [Juicy-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13097638) manages to pull off a 187 BPM singletapping-only play on [Log Off Now's rendition of the song](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1378089), then explore everything else **Sound piercer** has to offer:

Apparently [this link to **Sound piercer**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/334) doesn't load for some users. You should check to see if it works for you. And if it loads, maybe try mapping with one of the pre-timed beatmap templates.

On the lookout for more music? The [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) will have another instalment next Wednesday. Stay tuned for that and an extra-special release next week!
