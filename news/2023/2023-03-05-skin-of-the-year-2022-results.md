Even though we have 2 space themed skins in a row, [RUDEKA](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13015586)'s [Cosmos](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1586852?n=1) stays unique with a simple, yet detailed style. With a soothing blue tone being present, along with depictions of the cosmos displayed across the skin, it is easy to see how this entry gained **747** votes, which some might think is 20 too many.
