Been an active community member for a while? Felt an inner urge to chase after some osu! troublemakers? Now it's your time to shine! The Global Moderation Team is seeking new members.

It's been over 2 years since the [last GMT application cycle](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-10-04-global-moderation-team-applications-open), and while some things have changed, one thing remains the same — we may be looking for you!

The [Global Moderation Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/4) is responsible for keeping the community in a good condition, keeping it a welcoming place for everyone. Our green-coloured peers of the GMT not only help moderate the in-game chat and forums, but also engage with the mapping community among others. The members of the team can also give you assistance with some of your technical issues. The inherent goal for us is to reach closer and closer to the living community.

That being said, this time we will look not only for chat or forum moderators. If you feel you're a prominent figure in the osu! community and would like to help us with the community moderation side of things, be sure to shoot us an application as well!

While usually we seek new members in a [process of recommendations and nominations](/wiki/People/The_Team/Global_Moderation_Team#becoming-a-moderator), we're also opening applications like this one from time to time to look for fresh blood we might not be otherwise noticing — not everyone is so outspoken and perceptible at the end of the day! While we will still continue using our classic methods, we believe that reaching out to the community directly is vastly valuable to the team's health.

Before you apply, though, be sure to take a look through the list of factors regarding your application below:

- **You must be at least 18 years old. This is [NOT negotiable](https://osu.ppy.sh/legal/Terms#your-responsibilities-in-volunteer-positions).** The GMT role means that you will have to deal with content of inappropriate nature that's not suitable for all ages.
- **Your account must be at least one year old.** This is to ensure you are somewhat familiar with the osu! community at very least.
- You must be active within the osu! community. While we will not stick to chat or forum activity metrics explicitly (at least when it's not your everyday area of focus), we expect you to be active and engaged in certain communities.
- If selected, you will need to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](/wiki/Rules/Contributor_Code_of_Conduct).

While we will look into every single application, and we count on you to apply, there are certain areas that critically require manpower in particular. We're actively seeking moderators for the following channels: `#arabic`, `#bulgarian`, `#czech`, `#greek`, `#hebrew`, `#italian`, `#romanian` and `#turkish`.

What are you waiting for? **[Click here to apply!](https://form-auth.ppy.sh/form/2023-gmt-apps)** After authentication, you will be able to fill a Google Forms questionnaire, so be sure to reserve enough time as you will most likely need some time to answer the questions we've prepared for you!

The applications will remain **open for 2 weeks**, closing at **February 2nd, 2023 23:59 UTC+0**.

Please note that we are expecting a significant amount of applications to come in and therefore, it might take us a while to evaluate every single of them. We will reach to promising members in a few weeks from the closing date, so please be patient!

If you have any questions regarding the whole process, comment it below this news post, or reach out to any of the [Global Moderators](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/4).

Good luck to everyone participating!
