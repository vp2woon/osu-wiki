Before livestreaming and player YouTube channels were widespread, you could rely only on one man with a camera...

If you were even *slightly* engaged with the osu! community between 2015 and 2016, you might've heard of [ReeseWasHere](https://www.youtube.com/@ReeseWasHere). You may even have seen some of his YouTube videos, or at the very least caught wind of the saying *"Reese get the camera!!"* at the mention of an amazing high score (in homage to a [similar meme from the *Call of Duty* scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLRbZJS5A_E)). But without further ado, let's get into the history of this legendary community member and see what they are up to now!

Reese originally found osu! by watching a *League of Legends* streamer called [BoxBox](https://www.twitch.tv/boxbox), who used to play osu! while waiting in queue for the next match. He liked the fact that you can play anime songs, and gave it a try even without any rhythm game experience. After playing for a fair bit and dabbling in mapping, he realized that what he really loved doing is spectating top players, watching their streams on Twitch and sharing epic moments with the osu! community. In his own words:

> I really wanted to focus on liveplays because I wanted to capture them in the moment. I wanted it to be where you could relive the moment it happened just by watching the video, so I always incorporated Twitch chat or the ingame chat when I could. And even for those that weren't there live you could still feel like you was there by seeing people's reactions.

As if by divine intervention, the initiative to share amazing moments perfectly coincided with [Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493/osu)'s (now known as chocomint) return to online play after being banned for 2 years, a moment Reese was among the first to capture:

Emboldened by the hype from the community and finding himself in college with a lot of free time, Reese seized the opportunity to record almost anything Cookiezi-related as it happened. For a time, it seemed as if he was always online and ready to record at a moment's notice, usually ending up as the first upload a new top play from either Cookiezi or some other top player at the time.

Many iconic plays forever engraved into osu! history were captured during this period, such as the [1st-ever FC on *IMAGE -MATERIAL-*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm-zilvu8F0), the [1st-ever FC on *Everything will freeze*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d432cQoT-c) and the [1st-ever 700 pp score on *Blue Zenith*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYNpkDrCWtA), from which the "727" meme was born only to refuse to die to this day ([thanks Aireu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaAF51Gwbxo&t=72s)).

Unknown to him in the moment, Reese's YouTube channel was starting to turn into a time capsule of a simpler era, what some commentators today consider to be the "golden age of osu!". At the time, the combination of the hype towards fierce competition for the #1 spot, a legendary player returning and the mapping meta shifting to "pp mapping" (allowing for *big* pp numbers) was spurring the community into a score-craving frenzy.

High-achieving players such as [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286), [Angelsim](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1777162) and Cookiezi would all log on to a sea of viewers and spectators. Foundations were laid for practices like "replay recording", paving the way for YouTube channels such as [Circle People](https://www.youtube.com/@CirclePeople) to do just that later in 2016, beginning a period of fierce competition between channels fighting to be the first to snatch the latest big play.

What the community didn't know is that Reese's uploads were about to come to a screeching halt.

On January 30th 2016, Reese officially announced via a now-deleted [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/43c2pk/future_of_the_reesewashere_youtube_channel/) on r/osugame and a [tweet](https://twitter.com/ReeseWasHere/status/693250557419593729) that the channel will no longer be active. Now when inquired about it, he added that besides getting a full-time job, there were other factors affecting the decision to quit:

> ...after I graduated and started working I didn't really have much time to play osu! anymore, and I especially didn't have time to record liveplays. I wasn't really into the idea of just uploading videos of replay files, and I saw other channels were filling that gap, so I just stopped uploading.

To the question of whether he still keeps up with the community, he responded that he participated in r/place last year and has kept up with the development of osu!(lazer), eagerly waiting for it to be the new main client. He also suggested that he may return as a player at some point, but that any more contributions would likely happen via code, rather than uploading videos once again.

Hopefully this write-up hit older players with a wave of nostalgia for how things used to be. I also hope that newer players had fun learning about this small, yet meaningful period in osu! history, and how it has paved the way for the likes of [CPOL](https://www.youtube.com/@cpol_v1) to continue carrying the torch for replay channels on YouTube.

Even though Reese is no longer holding the camera, his legacy will always live with the community in some capacity.
