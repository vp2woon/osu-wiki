While most rhythm game music leans towards electronic genres, there's always room for traditional bands too. That's where our **Stars Hollow** comes in!

From the heart of land-locked America comes **Stars Hollow**, a 3-piece midwest emo band who's been rolling out future classics since 2016.

**9** of their outstanding tunes have found a home in [**Stars Hollow**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/353)! If you're guilty of starting maps and never finishing them, you'll be happy to know that most of their songs clock in at 2 minutes or less.

If you've ever wondered how mappers *actually make maps*, today's the day to find out. We're hosting a livestream on [the *osulive* Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) where a few things are happening:

1. **Mapping:** Experienced mapper [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) creates a map for a **Stars Hollow** songs and explains his thought process along the way
2. **Map comparison:** An amateur mapper creates a map for the same song with occassional feedback and analysis from pishifat
3. **Viewer feedback:** [Send pishifat a message](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418) with your own **Stars Hollow** beatmap for instant feedback

So if you want to learn how to map (or if you want to listen to **Stars Hollow** for a few hours straight), [check out the VOD of the stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1781345842) which ran alongside this announcement!
