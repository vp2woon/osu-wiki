The [osu!mania 4K World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_4K) is done for the year, but **7 new songs** debuted in the tournament will stick around forever!

Those new songs are all [**osu! originals**](/wiki/osu!_originals), a.k.a. songs created specifically for osu!. With input from the tournament staff and mappers behind [MWC 4K 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_4K), each track is filled to the brim with high note density and high intensity — two things that make osu!mania truly *feel* like osu!mania.

Check everything out:
