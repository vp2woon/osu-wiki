**Shadren** expands their creativity from mapping to music production as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/362/header.jpg)

osu! boasts a practically endless variety of music — so much music that it's impossible for a single person to love all of it. As an osu! player, **Shadren** was aware of this all too well, and decided to take matters into his own hands.

As an indie artist, **Shadren** combines all of his influences across the electronic realm, ranging from dubstep and house to lo-fi and technocore, and merging all of them together to create the sound he wishes was more popular on osu!.

Through being a Featured Artist, maybe his wishes will come true.

**12** tunes are up for grabs from [**Shadren**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/362), all pre-timed and ready for mapping.

If you've never heard **Shadren**'s sound before, his osu!-themed song *You're Here Forever* is a solid start. Check that out alongside osu!(lazer)'s Bubbles mod in the video below, then explore everything else:
