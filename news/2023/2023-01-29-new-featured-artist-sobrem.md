**Sobrem** waltzes into our Featured Artist collection.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/338/header.jpg)

Melding classical instrumentation with an unmatched rhythm game style, **Sobrem** (a.k.a. *w_tre*, *innkeeper*, and *Widowmaker*) brings an unorthodox flavor to the realm of beatmapping. Known for winning *BMS OF FIGHTERS* through *Giselle - Widowmaker* and *Sobrem x Silentroom - Random*, along with features in games like *Taiko no Tatsujin* and *CHUNITHM*, **Sobrem** is practically a household name in the rhythm game scene.

**9** revolutionary tunes have made their mark in [**Sobrem**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/338), all pre-timed for your upcoming mapping trials.

**Sobrem** debuted as one of osu!'s Featured Artists through [MWC7K 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_7K)'s map pool reveal earlier today. Witness legendary osu!mania player [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737) play through his own World Cup creation down here, then explore everything else for yourself:
