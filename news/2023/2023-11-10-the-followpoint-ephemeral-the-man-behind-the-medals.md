Welcome to **The Followpoint**, a brand-new series of interview-style podcasts with a different guest each release! This time around we were joined by [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335), the swole seagull who is in charge of all the magic behind [medals](/wiki/Medals)!

Ephemeral is a bit of an ever-present figure in osu!. Players as ancient as him may remember him for making [one of the (top 200) most played beatmaps of all time](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/10435), but most people know him for being a "community manager", having a hand in many things going on in the back-end.

Among his tasks is leading the development of medals. This makes him the prime subject of avid medal hunters, who have decided to organise an interview where anyone could attend to ask any questions their soul desired answers for, regarding medals or the man himself.

On October 28th, the [osu! Medal Hunters](https://discord.gg/8qpNTs6) Discord server staff hosted an interview with Ephemeral. A recording of the event is available below, complete with timestamps in the description for those of you who want to skip around.

**This video reveals solutions to multiple medals. If you want to search for their solutions yourself, you may want to hold off on watching it for now.**
