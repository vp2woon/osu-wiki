The greatest revolution to mapping since [OliBomby](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6573093)'s [Mapping Tools](https://mappingtools.github.io/) might have just hit the game today:

### Changes

- **Free-hand slider drawing.** That's right, weave slider shapes at extreme speeds. Grotesque abominations or intricate works of art, all at the grasp of your artistic (or shaky) brush strokes.
- **Ability to open [editor timestamp URLs](/wiki/Modding/Timestamp).** A crucial convenience for modders, albeit only for in-game chat modding at the moment.
- **Unstable rate calculations now account for rate changes.** The measure of how "spread out" your hits are in time, previously didn't measure in real time when mods like HT or DT were applied.
- **HP drain rate now matches osu!(stable).** Well, almost. The new client version doesn't have [Geki and Katu judgements](/wiki/Gameplay/Judgement/osu!#geki-and-katu), which would give a bit of extra health at the end of each combo in the osu! game mode.
- **New skin editor button in the main menu.** You did know that there is a skin editor, right? If not, it's now more easily accessible and visible by simply going to `edit` -> `skin editor` right from the main menu!
- **Various performance optimisations, bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.** Check them all out in the [full changelog](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog/lazer/2023.1130.0) as always.

The developers are still making good headway into the [goal of earning performance points in osu!(lazer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crkT0aaowKQ) by the end of the year, but if you don't feel like waiting and want to try the new things out, they're all [right here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/download).
