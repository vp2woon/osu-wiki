Enjoy this spring's breeze with some joyful Loved picks!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

To those who're still unfamiliar with what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As always, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the March votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

- [Results for osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1738583)

- [Results for osu!catch](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1738581)
- [Results for osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1738580)

Before we get to the picks, let's go through a couple announcements regarding the Project Loved team:

- We've unfortunately had to bid farewell to 3 longstanding team members who've contributed a lot to the project during the past 2 years, as they have decided to resign recently. The following members are:
  - [POCARI SWEAT](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5082685) (osu!taiko)
  - [Quenlla](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4725379) (metadata)
  - [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063) (osu!mania, metadata)
- In brighter news, we're opening applications for the **osu!taiko captain** and the **metadata reviewer** positions in the team! If you've ever wanted to leave a positive touch on the road that Project Loved has to traverse on a monthly basis, now's your chance! Click on either banner below to apply for its respective position, and good luck!

[Kagetora. - Crazy banger](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1232750#osu) by [waywern2012](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5870453)\
160 BPM, 1:49 | 9.63★\
*description written by [Skill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7802027)*

OMG THAT'S MY FIRST TEN ST-\
Anyways.. The *Popular Playcount* pick for this month is [waywern2012](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5870453)'s take on Kagetora.'s *Crazy banger*.

At a whopping 370K+ playcount and many more views on YouTube, there is no doubt that this is one of the most demanded maps to fit this slot. This map tests how world class your alt-aim ability is; 9.63\* 320 BPM snappy jumps and flowy-alt patterns are no joke after all. Mainly being known for being [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902)'s first 10\* FC (before rework), this map has made its way all around the osu! community, unless you've been living under a rock. And if you have, check out the *Crazy banger* scores arguably the two best aim players in the world have produced.

[mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902)'s ["my first 10\* fc crazybanger 1062pp if ranked"](https://youtu.be/LzRAMNmHicU) & [WhiteCat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101)'s ["osu! 4❌on 10.3⭐CRAZY BANGER +HR"](https://youtu.be/AXrtmOJ2lNA)

Do you think this map deserves to finally have a leaderboard? It's up to you!

[REDALiCE ft. Ayumi Nomiya - Foughten Field (t+pazolite Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/50777#osu) by [Foreverends](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/968756) and [Rizia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1367570)\
230 BPM, 3:36 | 1.51★, 2.12★, 3.08★, 5.36★, 6.26★\
*description written by [Kingling](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7010761)*

When it comes to top tier unranked old maps, [Foreverends'](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/968756) mapset of [REDALiCE ft. Ayumi Nomiya - Foughten Field (t+pazolite Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/50777#osu/225296) is surely one that comes to plenty of players' minds.

Having been used in a plethora of tournaments throughout the nearly 10 years this map has been submitted, as well as being a great challenge map for those looking to practice their 230 BPM tapping and aim, this map is a prime example of what the *Outstanding Oldies* category is all about.

If you too think this map is perfect for the Loved category, go ahead and vote for this map!

The \[Expert\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [Aistre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879380)*

This month's *Small Spectacles* nomination is bought to you by none other than our very own osu! Paragon — [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418)!

This shorter version of [Shoujo - Reminiscing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/666342#osu/1410301) has a full spread ranging from 2.3\* to 5.7\* with the Extra difficulty utilising circular patterns and a hint of precision from CS5, meaning anyone is able to enjoy this banger to its full extent. Be sure to also check out the clean and satisfying storyboard made by [Milan-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1052994), and give this mapset your vote if you wish to see it in Loved!

216 BPM, 5:55 | 7.75★, 8.29★\
*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

Boss music truly fitting for the *Daredevil Difficulty* pick of the month, [Sky of Twilight](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1457061#osu/2994583) finds itself another spotlight.

With two difficulties, both 6 minutes long, rated at 7.65\* and 8.13\*, there's a lot to enjoy for any aim aficionado here. These maps opt less into the streams and rather heavily into the jumps, with the top difficulty sporting a killer ending of cross screen jumps. Despite this, every jump in these maps flows beautifully, and hitting them provides satisfaction like no other. Check this one out, and if you enjoy make sure to vote yes!

*description written by [Kingling](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7010761)*

The *Ranked Reject* pick for this month is the beloved [Deadlock - A New Era](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1227180#osu) brought to you by [ItsWinter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6381153), [Drummer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4102249), and [- Heatwave -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4166621)!

Housing three beautifully crafted difficulties, this mapset shows each of these mappers bringing their own unique twist to this melodic death metal classic. Looking for a challenging 6.8\* spaced stream and aim map? ItsWinter has got you covered. Want to test your 185 BPM stamina? The Drummer difficulty is the one for you! (It also has over 35K plays and 120 favourites on its [own mapset](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/792017#osu/1661389), impressive stuff!) Or if you're just looking to sit back and vibe to an incredible song then look no further than - Heatwave -'s difficulty.

If you want to see this map start *A New Era* of its own in the Loved category, don't forget to give it your vote!

*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

Coming in hot to the Loved category with a fresh coat of paint and an addition of three more difficulties, [Mr HeliX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2330619) finds themselves with another *Gameplay Gimmick* map nomination.

Originally made for [Banger Bonanza 2022](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1541618?n=1), this storyboard map has a deceitfully low star rating. The map provides a grid and pattern, which you must memorize and repeat. As this grid moves around the playfield, it provides an unique type of memorization not seen in many maps. Go try it yourself, and enjoy the cat in the background while you're at it!

Hands up, [IOSYS - SCARLET KEISATSU no GHETTO PATROL 24-ji](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1524066) is here to meet this month's *Meme Monstrosities* quota! Face off in difficulties ranging from 1.67\* to 6.95\* — we've got your crew covered head to toe. Anyone can click to the beat of this footwork!

If you've been on TikTok or YouTube Shorts for even a second in the last year you will surely know the song this week's *Chill Champion* mapset is for.

[bluirre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/22241162)'s interpretation of [JVKE - this is what falling in love feels like](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1684158#osu/3441177) is probably as chill as you can get, with the top diff sitting at a casual 4.37\* absolutely anybody can pick up and play this set — there is even a super unique CS 8.5 difficulty for those precision specialists out there! Just sit back, relax and enjoy playing osu! to one of the most popular songs of 2022. (And if you want a surprise, open the map in the editor and press Ctrl + A.)

Go give it a play, and if you love it as much as I do, don't forget to vote yes!

If you're a fan of tech and streams this is the perfect mapset for you. Featuring 8 difficulties ranging from 8.11\* all the way down to 2.65\*, it definitely has a difficulty for you. With GD's from \_Epreus, TheBlank, Seolv, Moko, PaRaDogi, Kloyd and door weapon, you know you're in for a treat with these mappers. At 2:05 in length, you might find yourself playing this one a lot just for that good run you're looking for.

Does this mapset deserve to enter Loved and finally have a leaderboard? It's up to you. Vote now!

Believed to be many of your favorite mappers' favorite mapper, tatemae conceived a wonderfully evocative beatmap. Riffing and dancing with the beautiful guitars and vocals, *Ningen tte Sonna Mono ne* is brimming full of various beautiful styles a beatmap can offer; because of course, what is a tatemae beatmap without all of them at once? Sprinkling the circles and sliders on the infamous background of flower beds, tatemae successfully made a striking feat of raw beauty with this beatmap. In short; *he was cooking, fr*.

A Eurobeat Remix of *A Cruel Angel's Thesis* is enticing enough, but a collab between [Axarious](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2614511), [Asphyxia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1715720), and [melloe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2367616)?! Make sure not to miss this month's third *Wildcard*.

You'll find within this map's 4-minute runtime some flowy-tech jam-packed in — the 7.34\* difficulty rating is not lying. Throughout the map it continuously finds a way to satiate the desire to vibe along with the music, delivering patterns that despite appearing uncomfortable, glide beautifully. If you find yourself even slightly curious, I heavily recommend you check this one out, and voting yes to see this in the Loved category!

In this issue, I would like to introduce a [Lefty3](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4719175) challenge map, known as Metronome Man in Japan.

*MYUKKE. - DONBRA COBRA* is a double BPM map and is a favorite warm-up map among Japanese players. There are no streams in this map, so even intermediate players can easily challenge it. Can you play the 1/3 + 1/4 layouts streaming at 340 BPM without making mistakes?

Let's all become metronome man!

Time for a full set to appear again in the Taiko Loved realm, and there's no better option than [Fallmorph](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5720389)'s version of *Sota Fujimori - polygon*. Several high-ranked players would remember this song with a funny polygon dog due to TWC, however this version is known not only by absolute drum smashers but the ones who just started their journey through the seas of rhythm.

Each diff from this set has been included in at least one tournament over their lifetime, covering every skill range there is. It's no surprise this mapset had accumulated such an enormous play count, and we have the obligation to bring such maps up for you to finally decide whether a leaderboard is necessary or not.

If you haven't tried this mapset, it doesn't matter if you have just started this game mode, rest assured it would serve as a great progression landmark for your journey!

*Hongik Univ. Station (french)* both composed and mapped by [7_7](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7491106) features a hilarious song that is just as enjoyable to listen to as it is to play along with.

[7_7](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7491106) did an amazing job at making his mapping fit the song perfectly, and is expertly crafted to match the playful and upbeat nature of the song. Even when played at its 245 BPM version, the chart remains fun and engaging with patterns that feel natural and intuitive.

In addition to the main beatmap, the guest beatmaps are also fantastic: each one captures the essence of the song in its own unique way, with patterns that are creative and challenging while still feeling true to the original composition. One guest chart even quotes the song *Aether Ritual*, and even though it may sound cheesy, it truly adds an extra layer of cleverness and fun to the experience.

Overall, this beatmap set is a standout example of how great music and skillful beatmapping can come together to create an incredibly fun and satisfying gaming experience.

*katagiri - Bootleg Heaven* features a jazzy, chaotic sounding mashcore song featured as part of the [EGTS 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2022) Finals mappool as a No Mod 6 pick that will for sure put your skills to the test!

Created through a collaborative effort between two of the most experienced high-BPM charters, [KTYN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2250574) and [Rinze / ler1211](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19901680), this chart is a masterpiece of fast-paced and challenging gameplay, which clocking in at 320 BPM, is definitely not for the faint of heart.

Despite the intense speed, the chart is crafted with a high level of care and attention to detail. The notes are placed in a way that feels intuitive and organic, with patterns that flow seamlessly with the music. Every moment is filled with excitement and energy, with intricate rhythms and rapid-fire notes that demand your full attention. This level is a true showcase of the artistry and skill that goes into creating a high-quality beatmap.

Perhaps one of the best known non-Ranked [tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767) mapsets, *Garakuta Doll Play* features a classic TAIKO-HOLiC style challenge at the top of the difficulties with quality lower difficulties supporting it. All of this means just one thing: an enjoyable playing experience for almost everyone!

As most sasakure.UK songs are very creative, who could map it better than the mapping paragon tasuke912. This classic TAIKO-HOLiC difficulty forms a nice speed challenge with some tricky 1/3, long bursts and even some streams.

Are you ready to take on this TAIKO-HOLiC, or are you sticking to the less exhausting difficulties? This set has it all.

*willow tree* (composed by [Red Riding Hood](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8050850) and mapped by [Metzo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10633982)) is a serious reading challenge. It features Metzo's unique and recognisable take on slider velocity changes and takes it to an extreme. With the map constantly varying from especially high to low SVs, this large range means the map requires total focus and reading proficiency. On top of this, Metzo saves the hardest but most satisfying part of the map until last, introducing a unique gimmick that mixes slower notes with progressively speeding up notes, causing some difficult overlaps. Do you have what it takes?

As soon as the map starts your ears start to pick up the signal...

*"JAAAH WAT EEN GOED IDEE, DAT PTO DAT GAAN WE DOEN. JAAAH DAT WORDT POMPEN MET DIE SUBWOOFER!!!!"*

But don't get me wrong boss, it is not lying to you. The bold statement by a gentleman who had his sentence molded into history with the legendary map *POMPEN MET DIE SUBWOOFER* would never tell lies.

Being one of the bigger joke maps in the osu!catch community, POMPEN MET DIE SUBWOOFER created by [Sartan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4100941), [Wesley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2407265), [CakeAndBanana](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1981424), and [Dilophosaus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7106297) has found its way onto the list for this ranking season. Previously, being a joke and even being attempted to be put up for loved last year by two immensely brave Beatmap Nominators, the dream was to get this map memorialized with a leaderboard—considering the heavy amount of likes that the map has received over the last 6 years. Despite being in the graveyard since its launch, *POMPEN MET DIE SUBWOOFER* has always been an inside joke inside the communities older members for quite some time.

As for gameplay, it fits all ranges of player and uses a pretty simplistic mapping style with some odd tweaks on regular patterning as well as rhythm choice.

So, do you want to pump up the subwoofer and break your headphones in the process of giving this map an opportunity for greatness?

It is time to show off another banger made By [Fauzan 2000](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9317817)! The song should be nothing new to most as there are a bunch of osu! mapsets, but of course this is an osu!catch nomination so this mapset contains a single difficulty with a whopping star rating of 7.08.

The mapping style is very clean and fits perfectly with the song intensity. It starts out on the slower side, making it very possible for almost everyone that is able to read AR 9.8 to get around a 400 combo without too much trouble. Once you have passed this mark it'll start to speed up quite a bit giving you a bunch of hyperdashes combined with some zigzags. Near the ending you'll also find some stacked notes that might throw you off guard if your catcher positioning is slightly off.

Overall it isn't really a gimmicky map but as mentioned before a very clean Overdose/Deluge-style map.

Make sure to give the map a go and see if you enjoy it!

*agony* mapped by [Madoka Ayukawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1595221) and [Dika312](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/741613) is a very simple mapset with a very enjoyable style. Dika's difficulty, while being much harder than the average Rain, holds a fun variety of patterns including spaced triples, stairs, and some stacks that require some good platter placement.

Because this map has the low approach rate of 8.7, playing with Hidden can offer a fun experience for most players, and if you prefer Double Time, the aforementioned patterns can serve as a great challenge for just about anybody. Madoka's difficulty offers a much different experience as it has convert-like spacing, extended wiggles and a lot of tough transitional patterns. In general, this set can reach a wider audience as its pretty good practice for almost anyone at any level and is overall just a fun map to play with a great song.

Probably one of the least known mapsets by [Rocma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276), and yet, these two difficulties are some HIGH-quality mapping right there.

Entries from 2020's osu!catch Mapping World Cup Round 2, having placed respectively 3rd place, for team Various Countries #1, with a collaboration between [-Ken](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4430811), [wonjae](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5032045), and [salchow](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9738159), and having placed 1st place in this round, for team South Korea, with a collaboration between [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598) and [Rocma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276), both maps, despite having a very close star rating, have both gone for... VERY different approaches.

Going through Team Various Countries #1's difficulty, they have mainly gone for a nice-and-sweet stream map. Nothing too hard, but nothing too easy either. If you're used to this star rating, there should be plenty of fun to be had on this! It may be simple, but it's very effective.

Now though, with Team South Korea's entry, we have a whole different beast on our hands. Remember the nice streams from Various Countries's difficulty? Throw these out the window, welcome to one hell of an underrated tech map. Platter control is required at all points within this map. Try not getting thrown off by these patterns, but it's gonna be hard!

If you've enjoyed any of these two difficulties though, definitely do think of giving it a vote to help it go in the Loved section!

XeoStyle's past Loved selections have been very versatile, ranging from [early game SVs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/299842), [tech](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/638552), [chordjacks](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/537933), [a marathon-sized banger](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/429742), [an even bigger and more iconic marathon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/682489) and even a [full spread](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/520438)! Today, we are looking at a rice gauntlet: *Those Who From the Heavens Came*.

*Those Who From the Heavens Came* is a 6-minute long endurance test, featuring jumpstreams ranging from 220 to 250 BPM. The 250 BPM sections hit the hardest by far, with incredibly strenuous and dense patterning that stood ahead of its time back in 2016. For many players even today, this map stands as a boss fight between being decent at the game and being really good. Whether you will be aiming for an HP pass, an A, S or even SS, good luck, because you'll need it.

The votes are not going to come from the heavens. *You* are the ones who will decide whether this map makes it to Loved. Let's hear it!

Today's special, *chiltonWALK.temp*, stands as a rare 4K contribution from Nivrad00.

So what do you do when your usual canvas consists of 7 or more keys, but you have to confine your creativity into just 4 of them? Easy, just spread your patterning vertically instead of horizontally! Well, that's the essence of *chiltonWALK.temp* anyways: a very unintuitive and mind-boggling SV memorization and deciphering experience that will leave you scratching your head in the map editor for hours.

[Ena](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13799949), formely known as Xeroa, has been a low-key contributor to extremely high difficulty mapsets for various key skillsets, namely chordjacks, jumpstreams, handstreams and so on. *Do It To It* is one of their most popular and accessible chordjack mapsets... which is to say it is still pretty high-level.

With 1.0 starting at 125 BPM, the patterning is forgiving enough, but spurts of density will keep you on your toes and drain your stamina bit by bit. It is a bit denser than average, so keep that in mind while picking your rate of choice! Just don't break your desk or table while playing 1.4 at 175 BPM please, or god forbid Double Time on any of the rates...

Many old-school players should be familiar with [ATing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4763040)'s numerous and various long-note oriented maps, and many of them developed their fundamentals and skills with them. *Saika* presents itself as one of such beginner-friendly LN mapsets.

With 4 LN-oriented difficulties to pick from, *Saika* is a graceful introduction to long note fundamentals and finger coordination that I think every growing player should play at least a few times. Coming from 2019, the entire mapset has been extensively used in more tournaments than I can keep track of, so many players should already be familiar with it.

Your challenge for those leaderboards will be trying to aim for accuracy: with ScoreV1 (with HR for the most daring), your ratio should tell you how on point and fine-tuned your releases are. But remember, to get those leaderboards, you must first go and cast your vote in the thread!

The F1n4l Judg3m3nt difficulty in particular can be particularly jarring to play with its use of jacks and dump patternings throughout. The other difficulty, Tr4g1c H3ro1n3, is an easier version for those who struggle with the top difficulty.

[Reba](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3087654) is back once again with a nomination featuring an underrepresented skillset in 7K: chordjacks!

There exists few chordjack charts in 7K with leaderboards, and we feel that *Omae Wa Mou* would be a great addition to this small group. With progressively denser chordjacks as the chart progresses, there is plenty of variety in the patterning which serves as great practice. There are rates up to 1.4x as well for those who need to increase the speed.

Reading very dense chordjacks is often a major hurdle in the progression of many 7K players, and we believe you will find value in seeing this Loved. Don't forget to cast your vote.

Even though this does not require insane physicality or coordination like some of our other LN picks for Loved, you will still find yourself dropping plenty of accuracy-reducing judgments if you are not careful about the release timings.

With regards to the 7K difficulties, we are skipping the =w= difficulty because it is identical to the Blue difficulty for the vast majority of the chart. We believe there is more value in nominating the MWC difficulty in this case.

Overall, this set is a great example of fun LN charts with a focus on release timings. We hope that you enjoy these kinds of charts too.
