osu!'s Featured Artist library is officially 200% sweeter.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/372/header.jpg)

If you've played maps like [Future Candy](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/546820), [Sunset Tea Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/634949), or [Magical Mixer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/680338), you know exactly how awesome it is to have **YUC'e** in our catalogue. And if you haven't played those, we envy your future.

**YUC'e** released their debut album *Future Cake* in 2016, and the osu! community took notice immediately. In the last 7 years, more than 30 maps showcased **YUC'e**'s sound throughout the Ranked and Loved sections, plenty of which have literally *millions* of plays.

Practically every osu! player knows **YUC'e**, so we're happy to announce that **27** of their mesmerising tunes are prepared for mapping from [**YUC'e**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/372)!

## Featured Artist playlists

We've launched a batch of new [**Featured Artist playlists** in osu!(lazer)](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists) in *all* game modes! The **top 10 players** in each playlist are eligible to earn some fancy profile badges, as explained [here](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists#prizes). For example, [these folks were the winners from the last playlist](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-07-08-new-featured-artist-krimek#featured-artist-playlists)!

That said, there's no better way to experience **YUC'e** than clicking circles for yourself. (So try out the playlists.)

...but the second best way is to click this video:
