After months of mapping, judging, and voting, the first half of Twin Trials is coming to a close! It's time to see which duos take home the gold for every game mode.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/166/header.jpg)

[3 months ago](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-02-01-twin-trials-contest-beatmapping-phase), we launched [**Twin Trials**](/wiki/Contests/Twin_Trials_Contest), a contest with two phases: *beatmapping* and *storyboarding*, all centred around some new [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals) created by one of our old-school [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) [*James Landino*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/39).

Today, the results are in.

## Beatmapping phase results

### Judging criteria

Because every submission included 5 difficulties, judging for this contest was a bit more complicated than usual.

To start, each of the 5 difficulties had its own judging category, aiming to evaluate the difficulty's overall quality. These were weighted according to each difficulty's complexity:

| Difficulty | Max points |
| :-- | :-- |
| Easy | 8 |
| Normal | 9 |
| Hard | 10 |
| Insane | 11 |
| Expert | 12 |

On top of these, a few categories were evaluated across all difficulties. These are categories you'd find in ordinary mapping contests:

| Judgement category | Max points | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Musical representation | 20 | How the beatmap expresses the song through overall structure, patterning, and hitsounding (if relevant to the game mode) |
| Creativity | 20 | How innovative the beatmap is relative to other submissions and the game mode's general mapping practices |
| Judges' impression | 10 | General impression and anything else of note in a submission that does not fit existing categories |

For the full list of prizes, check out the [Twin Trials Contest wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Twin_Trials_Contest#prizes). This includes some osu!supporter rewards for some teams that aren't listed below!

#### Judging winner

With so many veteran mappers entering **Twin Trials**, everyone knew the competition would be fierce.

On the judges' side, [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334) and [iljaaz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8501291) proved they have what it takes to create 5 consistently awesome difficulties. [Their submission](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1971987) explored the more challenging side of what the song had to offer, while maintaining a crispy clean style throughout.

With this outcome, the two mappers have earned the profile badge below, [2 points of progress towards the *Elite Mapper* user title](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points), and their map will be used as the base for the storyboarding phase of **Twin Trials** in the near future!

Runner-ups [acnozei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10141268) and [flake](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7627157) earned [a point of progress towards the *Elite Mapper* user title](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) too. If you're looking for an easier map than the winner, [this one](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1971997) may be worth a try!

#### Community vote winner

While judges favored [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334) and [iljaaz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8501291)'s map, the wider osu! community took a different stance.

[This submission](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972749) by [Sylas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3906405) and [Mimari](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14339830) stood out above the rest according to the [community vote](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/166) we held with osu!(lazer)'s playlists. Only players who finished a difficulty from every submission were capable of voting, so all mapsets were considered with each vote!

That said, [Sylas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3906405) and [Mimari](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14339830) have been granted the profile badge below thanks to circle clickers like you.

![Twin Trials osu! community vote badge](https://assets.ppy.sh/profile-badges/twintrials2023-COM-STANDARD.png)

And while they're not earning major prizes, we'd like to also shout out [yf_bmp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1243669) and [Moecho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5075660) for making an unparalleled submission for the song [Anti Hero](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972202), which  was relatively untouched in osu! submissions. If you're looking for something completely fresh (both musically and from a mapping perspective), this is the map for you.

#### Judging & community vote winner

[![Frozen Bananas team banner](/wiki/shared/news/2023-04-17-twin-trials-beatmap-voting-open/taiko/Frozen%20Bananas.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972268)

Sitting atop the podium is [this submission](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972268) by legendary osu!taiko residents [uone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5321719) and [iceOC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5482401)! Each of them have a longstanding history in the osu!taiko community, winning tournaments left and right, and now they're here to put a mapping competition into their portfolios too!

The satisfaction of being the top scoring submission is good enough, but we'll also be rewarding both mappers their own profile badge and [2 points of progress towards the *Elite Mapper* user title](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points).

Just missing the winner's threshold was [this submission](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1975181) created by a not-so-conventional pairing. [Horiiizon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8071438) is an osu!taiko mapping legend, while their partner [fieryrage](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3533958) dominates the osu! scene through an unmatched trio of mapping, modding, and playing capabilties.

This outcome adds yet another skill to fieryrage's collection, and further solidifies Horiiizon's already impressive reputation. Oh, and of course, both of them have earned [a point of progress towards the *Elite Mapper* user title](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points)!

fieryrage also managed to earn *something else* from this contest, [but we'll get to that later](#twin-trials-playlist-leaders).

Sorry to those who root for the underdogs — [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134) and his partner [-Rustyy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16355636) are here to take the gold in yet another mapping contest. [Their submission](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972145) impressed both the judges, only barely surpassing [Deif](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/318565) and [autofanboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114) in almost all categories.

Jemzuu and -Rusty's efforts towards osu!catch mapping have paid off. Both have earned themselves a catch-specific profile badge and [2 points of progress towards the *Elite Mapper* user title](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points).

Neck and neck, [Deif](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/318565) and [autofanboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114) narrowly took the lead from [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134) and [-Rustyy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16355636) in the [community vote](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/168)!

One of osu!mania's top players is now proven to be one of osu!mania's top mappers too. [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904) and mapping veteran [richardfeder](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2446000) impressed all 5 members of the judging panel with [their 7K submission](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972242)!

Each mapper has been awarded their own profile badge and [2 points of progress towards the *Elite Mapper* user title](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points).

[AutotelicBrown](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4238941) and resident NAT member [Akasha-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596306) fell just short of first place with [this 4K submission](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972034).

In an unprecedented scenario, osu!mania's [community vote](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/169) resulted in a **3-way tie** between [BringoBrango](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10274043)/[Stability](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701738), [Hytex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8536263)/[Ucitysm](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14768693), and [MapleSyrup-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1192936)/[lenpai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5314573)!

We've let the judges' scores act as a tiebreaker! Out of the three submissions, [this one](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972411#mania/4092859) created by [MapleSyrup-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1192936) and [lenpai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5314573) scored the highest, so they'll earn the community vote prize!

## Twin Trials playlist leaders

That'll cover the mapping results, but there's more to this contest!

To vote for this contest, we required the community to **play each of the submissions in osu!(lazer)** through one of the five difficulty-specific playlists (Easy/Normal/Hard/Insane/Expert).

As an added bonus, we also decided to reward the players at the top of each playlist with a month of osu!supporter, plus the **Twin Trials Champion profile badge** for the winner of the Expert playlist!

## Conclusion

Scrolling all the way here must've been hard work. Well done.

Thanks to everyone involved this contest — whether that be as a participant, a judge, a voter, or even someone who has followed along until today!

The storyboarding phase of this contest will start in the near future, so stick around for that upcoming spectacle!

Until then, have fun mapping. :)
