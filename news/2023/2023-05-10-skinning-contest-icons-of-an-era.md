Celebrate 15 years of osu! by expressing your creativity through osu! skinning!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/178/header.jpg)

Over the course of osu!'s history there have been many memories made, whether that'd be related to maps that would become legendary within the community, plays that to this day remain unbeaten and are considered the best of all time, or the various community-made creations that have been popularised throughout the years.

We wanted this contest's theme to not only centre around some of those memories, but also provide plenty of material that could inspire the skinning community to take part and provide us with some amazing skins!

## Theme: Icons of an Era

The theme for this contest is **Icons of an Era**. We aim to spark the community's imagination by encouraging creators to make beautiful skins centred around various iconic osu! beatmaps that have risen to glory throughout osu!'s lifetime, as well as paying homage to the many official or community-made osu! mascots that have been introduced over the course of the past 15 years.

Here are a couple of examples:

- skin centred around a beatmap background
- skin centred around a group of beatmap backgrounds
- skin focused around a specific mascot or group of mascots
- any combination of the above (e.g. pippi singing into the microphone from [The Big Black](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/41823#osu/131891))

Whatever you end up choosing, please make sure that the theme is prominent as anyone should be able to open your entry and almost immediately recognise what the inspiration behind your entry was.

Before you decide to take a journey through osu!'s history and come up with ideas, let's clear some ground rules, as well as the various schedules and prizes for the top entries!

## Participation

As is tradition by this point, all skins have to be created from scratch and be aligned with the rules listed below!

In order to submit your skin you must:

- post your entry on the forums under the [Work In Progress Skins](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/119) subforum
- post a link to your entry in the [submission thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1762287) using the format listed in the post

Since all entries will have their respective forum threads publicly available, contestants and their submissions will not be anonymised. In fact, we encourage you to show off your work as much as you want!

## Voting

After the submission phase is over in roughly 35 days' time (from the date of posting this article), the entries will be made available for community voting. Make sure to get involved when the time comes!

The voting will stay open for 14 days. Once that passes, the top 3 entries will become eligible for prizes as described below.
