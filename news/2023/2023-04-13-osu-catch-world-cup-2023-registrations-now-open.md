Get ready to catch the beat and dodge the competition, as the osu!catch World Cup is back for its 12th instalment!

![](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2023/img/cwc2023-banner.jpg)

Following the trend set by our very own [osu!taiko World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2023), we're making a few changes to the format, more specifically on the mappooling department. In previous years, mappools had a considerable amount of convert beatmaps (at least one per mod bracket). For this iteration, every round will have only one convert, placed on the NoMod bracket, so that the overall difficulty of the maps can be more accurately represented.

Continuing our ongoing efforts towards diversifying the ways the community can contribute to the World Cups, we have created an **[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/osu-tournaments/events/osu-catch-world-cup-2023-3aaa5a51)** to allow for donations, which will be added to the prize pool at the end of the competition.

If you're *still* not familiar with Open Collective, it is a platform that allows us to coordinate the finances of the World Cups in a transparent way, and also allows users to help support the tournament in greater amounts outside of purchasing profile banners or subscribing to the osu!live Twitch channel. You can do any one (or all) of these things if you want and they'll still go towards the tournament!

You can donate directly to the prize pool of the upcoming World Cup of your choosing in a lump sum with or without an Open Collective account, and you can even leave a little message of support that will be displayed beneath your contribution, if you like.

*Please note that any "tips" made during the payment process go to Open Collective and not to us!*

## How do I register?

- **[Click here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/38)**
- Teams will be formed by each country's captain *after* the registration phase has concluded.
- **The deadline for registering is April 26, 23:59 UTC. Make sure to get yours in before then!**

*Notice: you may only participate if your position in the osu!catch global ranking is #5000 or higher, and you have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months.*

If your registration passes our internal checks, you will be placed on the candidate list for your country. When that country's captain has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

*Remember that any registrations submitted after the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances — submit your registration ahead of time to avoid any last-minute headaches. If you run into any issues, send an email to [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto:tournaments@ppy.sh).*
