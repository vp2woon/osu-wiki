If you grew up in the mid-2000's, you're in for a nostalgia treat. **True North** is an alternative rock band that aims to blend nostalgic emo rock with contemporary pop, leading to a style that perfectly suits the osu! crowd.

We've picked out **6** soon-to-be-classics for [**True North**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/344), each timed in advance so you can spare yourself from a whole 30 seconds of struggle.

Enough words. Let your ears take it from here:
