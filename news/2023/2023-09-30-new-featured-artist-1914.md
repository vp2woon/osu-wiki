**1914** makes history as the latest addition to our Featured Artists!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/382/header.jpg)

Some musicians create music inspired by their favourite artists or genres. Ukrainian metal band **1914**, however, creates music inspired by the chaos and terror behind World War I.

7-star marathon maps like [FN .380 ACP#19074](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1736332) and [Arrival. The Meuse-Argonne](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1734521) have provided a new battleground for the highest tier of circle clickers. As of today, even more of **1914**'s songs are joining the ranks!

More specifically, **7** masterfully crafted stories (featuring intense metal backing) can be found on [**1914**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/382).

During [COE](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event/2023) two months ago, we glued [etn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4581069) to a chair and forced him to full combo the climax of [Arrival. The Meuse-Argonne](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1734521). Check that out (along with the rest of these previews):
