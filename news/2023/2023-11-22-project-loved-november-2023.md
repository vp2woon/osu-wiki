The Christmas clock may be still ticking, but Project Loved has already prepared some presents for you!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

To those still unfamiliar with what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As always, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the October votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

- A new member approaches! Let's welcome [Leeju](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18219603) to the osu!mania captains, who will dedicate their time and efforts to serve you exquisite doses of 7K picks!
- However, all good things must come to an end at one point, so let's take a moment to bid farewell to [Kasumi-sama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263) and [Sartan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4100941) and thank them for their continued tenure with us, as they've decided to move on from the project.
- Fear not, because with the recent resignations, the osu!catch captains are now looking for some fresh blood to join them! If you're a seasoned fruit connoisseur and think you've got what it takes, apply to join the team by clicking the banner below!

Open your eyes wide for this month's pick for *Popular Playcounts*, it's none other than [Jeff Williams feat. Casey Lee Williams - Armed and Ready](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1289692#osu) by [-NeBu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4099626)!

-NeBu- is no stranger to getting his maps into Project Loved and it's easy to see why, with Armed and Ready now accumulating over 120,000 playcount! Over 5 full minutes of 9.4★ cross-screen jumps to the one and only Casey Lee Williams, what more could you ask for? Shoutout to [BlackDog5](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101) (formerly known as WhiteCat) who [choked what would have been worth 1100pp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWxo7CP0ma4) at the time, blowing up this map's popularity even further.

For this month's *Outstanding Oldies* pick, we are going back to the past... I mean, as always. This time a bit further!

[Hellzero](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/335784)'s beatmap of [Ofcourse You Need and nEed and neEd and neeD and NEED ME?](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/32883#osu) is what some would consider the pinnacle of early 2010's "graveyard mapping", also known as maps with "For Approval" in their description. Highly inspired by maps such as [chipscape](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/27752#osu/95382) (hence the difficulty name), this does not let down in comparison to some of the Approved maps of the era.

Work through never-ending 240 BPM bursts, challenging linear patterns, symmetrical jumps, and of course, a banging song to back it all up. And don't forget to bring your finger control!

This month's *Small Spectacles* pick is [Tegami](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/685539#osu/2448938) mapped by [Kenny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1225459) and [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418)!

This pretty chill and ambient 77 BPM mapset features a spread ranging from 2.07★ to 4.27★. pishi's difficulty can be described as simply elegant and conceptual, whereas the top difficulty *\[Sincerely,\]* shows a more meticulous approach to emphasising the beautiful vocals with fun sliders.

What I really want to show you is the storyboard created by [S2VX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1472763) and [niseboi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2747929). It was developed over many *many* hours, involving hundreds of individually rotoscoped frames and a whole lot of C++ coding to brilliantly execute. S2VX, or maxrchung, documented the [entire creative process](https://maxrchung.com/projects/tegami) in immense detail, which you should definitely check out! It really is a sight to behold, so please experience it at least once while playing.

Just a small warning—be careful with opening the map in the editor as it causes some serious lag and might crash in some instances. Nevertheless, be sure to cast your vote if you wish to see Tegami in loved!

Despite its previously failed voting, this *Second Shot* isn't going to be laying in its *death bed*!

This set has 4 difficulties ranging from 1.4★ to 3.43★, previously a *Chill Champion* pick, it really embodies that feel. A nice relaxing song that you've likely heard before, it is just a nice time to sit back and relax, perhaps drink a cup of coffee and don't go to bed.

[Nonbinarity](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1414457#taiko) is a map many japanese players will recognise for its high placement in the [Osu!Taiko Japanese Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1262022), and I would like to shed a light on this beatmap so everyone else can also enjoy this work of art.

Nonbinarity shows us how creative a map can be without using lots of slider velocity. Instead, Nonbinarity gets its high reputation from clever use of snappings to emphasize this crazy track. This map now also features a guest difficulty by [syaron105](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8741695), in classic syaron-styled-overmap fashion, the bye-narity difficulty offers a challenge for those who weren't done after obtaining the prestigious S-rank on the Inner Oni.

Will you be one of the brave warriors to face bye-narity? Or will you stick to uone's amazing Inner Oni? Nonetheless, you can vote for this map right now!

Let's go back in time with [Nyan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/36102)'s [Shujinkou - Kyouchou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/593543#taiko), better known as tarolabo - Kowatori, the infamous osu!taiko World Cup 2017 tech nomod pick! Despite its diabolic patterns and 1/6 usage, this map got picked in nearly every finals match back in 2017 and was never banned! If you know any tarolabo tracks, you will probably know what to expect, since this track is not any less complicated. Though, Nyan emphasized this very well with awkward patterns and a lot of 1/6 and 1/8 snappings.

This set also featured an Oni for the lesser experienced players out there. The one special difficulty to really highlight here is the 2014 firetruck difficulty, which is much like the TWC inner oni but with many slider velocity and slider gimmicks. If you'd like an extra challenge, make sure to try that one out!

Did you know that former rank 1 player [\_yu68](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6170507) even SS'd this map in the finals match that decided first and second place?! I hope you are ready to channel your inner yu for this one!

It consists of 5 fun difficulties mapped by well known mappers and each named after a different heroine in the game this song is from.

Due to the song's relatively short length as well as high replayability, you might recognize this set as it is often picked in multiplayer lobbies; however, did you know that this remix was made by [Ozu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/980092), who is also a taiko player?

The BPM of the song is 290, which means it is Double BPM, and surprisingly, the SR is 8.54! It has been played about 3,000 times, but the pass-rate is very low at 16.2%, so you can see why it is a challenge map.

This map is mainly composed of not 1/6 but 1/4 snaps. There is a sequence of short streams from the beginning, and a stream at the end of the song might be very difficult to hit for you!

If you don't have enough stamina to play 4 minute map, go practice with the short version diff and try to get S rank!

*keyyoung - Rainy Abyss* is one of those timeless classics made by none other than [Raphalge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3918650), with guest diffs by prominent mappers from South America: [Gamelan4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9856910), [Ulquip](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1263669) and [Coryn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2828556), providing quality content for most players out there.

This mapset, although lost in time and probably in a few BN queues, has an astonishing quality with silky patterns that roll off the hands like butter and is mostly clean of SV usage, allowing players to focus on being able to hit those patterns instead of strange reading skills.

Make sure to give this a try!

Those of you who have been playing for a few years or more are likely to recognise *Igorrr - Tout Petit Moineau* by [Ulqui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1263669), Submitted in 2018, *Tout Petit Moineau* is a very well done take on the prominent mapping style at the time. The Hell Oni is no joke at 7.72★: the first half of the map features some longer 1/4 patterns, a variety of doublets and sharp rises and contrasts in SVs. The most difficult part of this difficulty is undoubtedly the kiai, with deathstreams filled to the brim with 1/6 patterning.

For those who want a difficult experience without 1/6 patterning the Ura Oni has you covered! This difficulty also reduces the length of deathstreams and complexity of unconventional patterns.

Bonne Chance!

We have returned this month to now go through the [Razor Sharp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3414261) Backlog™, with one of his rare non-loved gimmick maps!

On the menu for this map, we have all the classic osu!catch gimmicks. Hyperwalks? Check. Stacked fruits? Check. Spinner overlaps? Check. Sliders that you should absolutely NOT try to follow or SS in any humane way? Check.

Is the 9★ on this a lie because of its gimmicks? Maybe...

Is it still super hard for most people? Yes.

Is it still very fun to play? Absolutely!

It is quite crazy to think about the fact that the highest difficulty of this map was used as a Hard Rock pick in the Grand Finals of CWC 2017; how far we've come in terms of player skill since then. But I reckon that even the players that have improved massively since will still enjoy seeing this classic in this week's round of loved maps. *snow storm -euphoria-* is a non-extreme, 4 difficulty set created by [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598) in collaboration with [Minato Yukina](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/531253), [Kyuare](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2705312) and [Rocma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276). Despite its serious quality in 2017 it unfortunately never got the chance to become ranked.

So, here we are! Considering the fact that the northern hemisphere is starting to become somewhat cold again, it made sense to prepare ourselves for the coming snowstorms. The map consists of a mix of jumps, short streams, and a bit of a difficulty increase for its kiai. Most players will certainly be comfortable playing one of the difficulties, but adding mods to the map imbues it with new life and makes it challenging again (without any oddities)! To the crazies out there: double time may certainly be an option for the highest difficulty by now...

So, are you staying inside or are you bearing the snow storm? Go check it out!

I reckon that everyone and their mother has seen the background of this map at least once somewhere. So, don't mind me shoving it in your face again; it is an everlasting sort of thing after all 😉.

I'm guessing some of us are still mourning the exit of [Kyuare](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2705312) from the osu!catch mapping community. But that's what we have Loved for! *Everlasting Message* is a single difficulty 2016 map, which was considered quite difficult at that time. Honestly speaking, I reckon lots of players will still find this map fairly tiring with its many left-rights all across the map, which are only momentarily paused at the 'calmer' streaming section. Hence, this map is not suited for novice players. But, for anyone around my rank or higher: there is plenty to enjoy here. Putting on Hard Rock makes the spacings between the jumps even harder, considering the fact that these spacings might not even be fully optimal on nomod for 2023 standards.

Either way, here's to another Kyuare map in our 2023 curriculum of loved maps. J'espère qu'il vous plaira!

You might see a returning theme here if you visited the [snow storm -euphoria-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/467816#fruits/1000764) map voting before this one; another [CWC 2017](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2017) grand final map!

They may not be the most consistently active mapper, but they sure made a great mark on osu!catch history after their effort on this cracking tiebreaker. Most people are surely already familiar with the type of music that our lovely featured artist Imperial Circus Dead Decadence makes, and what types of beatmaps it allows to manifest. *Yomi yori Kikoyu, Koukoku no Tou to Honoo no Shoujo* has \*MANY STREAMSSSSS\*, many many many \*STREAMSSSSSSSSSSSS\*. This 8-minute-long finger breaker is freaking rough, simply said. There's no magic behind it, you just need tons of stamina and focus in order to complete this behemoth, let alone get anything resembling a full combo. Again, this one is for the top players in our midst.

Surely, after we put two maps from CWC 2017 in this month's pool of loved maps, your competitive player mindset must've been activated, right? Go ahead and show us!

Time for a bit of a story.

So, this is my final round as a Loved captain after close to six years of contribution. It has been a hell of a ride, and I am very happy that I got to bring many fun maps to our community, rebirthing them with a leaderboard. I am thankful of having been able to fulfill this position, and I truly hope you enjoyed my picks!

Herewith, my final pick. One that does not really embrace the loved project's ideals for most players, but it sure does for me. I have always been against the idea that maps of bad quality should be barred from loved entry, arguing that one man's trash is another man's treasure. This map is a very treasured memory of mine, which is the reason why I very selfishly put this in this week's loved pool as a bonus. I *love* this map — despite its ridiculously dumb nature — due to the memories I have of this. This map represents some very close friendships that I have created on osu! through my participation in [CWC](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC) through the years of 2016 to 2020. Each year, the Dutch team would create an unhinged warmup map for our matches, trying to make the Twitch chat have a giggle whenever it would be played on the livestream. I feel like we have done this successfully so, until warmups were removed from CWC altogether. This map does not bear quality, and perhaps it does not ring a bell for most people, but I am fully certain that a select group of people would love seeing this map pop up again after a couple of years.

Despite the fact that I believe the loved project should not be loving these types of meme-esque world cup warmup maps all the time, I do hope that the loved spirit is never forgotten even after I leave the team, and it at least allows for the possibility that even the most ridiculous maps can receive a bit of love.

Thanks once more for all the great times, love you all dearly 😊.

It is no secret that the Loved category often gets and receives beatmaps from mappers who have already gotten maps loved before. This is by virtue of some mappers being exponentially more popular than others and having a stronger presence in the international community. The captains have however continuously welcomed the inclusion of new blood and names within the category, and this has been a strong directive line of thought for a good number of our picks.

You may be pleased to learn that **none of the mappers in this osu!mania November wave have had a map in the Loved category before.** This may sound like a funny gimmick, but it kind of just came naturally. As we suggested more and more maps from new names, we realized... we could do a full wave of new names. I hope you enjoy checking those mappers out!

Anyways, back to our SV slot.

[Claren](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9362562) has been a long standing name in the Singaporean community and has made their name known in past MWCs, in addition to being a generally outstanding accuracy and SV player. Many seasoned players have gotten their hands on mapping, and Claren is one of them. In terms of SV mapping, they have a knack for pushing concepts really far in execution: this can notably be seen in other maps such as *Q33B* ([4DM2023 version](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1943680), [4K MWC 2023 rejected version](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2066677)), 4DM2023's [*Trust It*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1935441) or VNMC 2022's [*Tell Me (The Meaning)*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1813400).

*Gotta Get Thru This*, as a DJ Majokko Mirakurun nightcore special, has a more conventional reading-based approach, but it still properly displays Claren's knack for polishing their gimmicks. As with many other DJ Majokko Mirakurun entries, the combination of nightcore aesthetic and flashy gimmicks has been a very popular style and a quite enjoyable one to play. And, while "market saturation" (so to speak) could be an issue in the long term, it is still pretty interesting to see the individual approaches from different mappers in terms of gimmicks.

Do you think this entry is gonna get thru this? Well, you gotta vote in the thread if you want it to get thru this!

The name [Biosphere](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6357823) might not be too recognizable, but with his first addition to the Loved section, [Undici](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2068331#mania/4327556), being put up for voting, it might become quite obvious as to who this actually is.

Known much better under the name [Zeta](https://etternaonline.com/user/Zeta64) inside the Etterna sphere, *Undici* made its first appearance onto osu! as a pick in the [Speed of Light 2: Lucha Libre Edition](/wiki/Tournaments/SOL/2020) Grand Finals pool. Tournaments aside, Terminal 11's music has made a good amount of appearances inside osu!mania and other VSRGs alike, and this song takes what you'd typically hear from them to another level, as taking a listen to the preview point would be describing more than enough for what you're being given. The chart is extremely faithful to the song itself, having almost every little sound accounted for. This focus ends up with the end result being a technical nightmare even for the ones skilled enough to play it. As for describing these incredibly threatening patterns... You're on your own. Good luck.

Despite the older and more well-known upload only recently being deleted due to a duplicate upload under a different account, you can be rest assured that this chart will finally be given the spotlight it deserves. All it takes is your vote!

Many may have discovered this chart due to the song's popularity (there are too many AI covers of it), instantly getting hooked by how satisfying it is to play. The most noteworthy aspect of this chart is the constant switch from singles or doubles to quads during the chorus, which heavily drains stamina. However, even though playing these patterns consistently can be challenging, when executed correctly, you feel as though you are one with the vocals. Even after enduring the gauntlet, there's still the ending, which ramps up the density featuring only doubles and quads.

Will you be able to withstand the *Quick and hateful cold*, or will you be the one to scream *AAAAAAAAAA* by the end? Be sure to cast your vote if you want to see this Loved!!!

The name [volcanic](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1642762) is, without a doubt, something that everyone who plays mania has heard at least once. With the heavy influx of top players trying to push their skill to the limit, we present you with [stupud man](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2141612)'s blue volca- I mean, [hurricanic -short size-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1551974)!

With the song itself being a successor to the well-known volcanic, this chart was made with the intention of representing the original challenge in its own fashion. Primarily consisting of 380 BPM streams for nearly two minutes, you'll be left with no stamina incredibly quickly, despite the short length of the song. To add on top of that, you're also faced with a long 285 BPM jumptrill, since song representation is important! Despite how scary everything I'm describing sounds, this rendition has gotten a great amount of praise for the patterning, leading it to be enjoyed by many top players who've got an itch for hard files looking for something similar, yet different than the original volcanic.

If volcanic wasn't enough for you, or if you simply want to watch the world burn, then you're encouraged to watch as people burn their fingers by voting for this file!

*description written by [Silhoueska Elze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

Chordjacks and Long Notes are some of the most popular patterns that are seen in the 4K meta right now, and interestingly enough, both of these skillsets are featured in this mapset created by [law38204](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10927256), named [Mood Breaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1231834#mania/3227233)!

The Jack Breaker difficulty certainly offers you challenges related to the chordjack skillset, as it features a lot of with consecutive jumps, hands and quads thrown at you. If it is not enough, there are even certain jumpstream and technical patterns that are also added into the mix. This alone already provides a wide range of patterns while still being able to test your ability to play chordjacks without the need to essentially metronome the entire map. You really need to be careful about that ending though: it gets ridiculously dense, and the moment you lose focus, it will certainly be game over for you.

Meanwhile, the LN breaker difficulty still features some rice patterns into it; however, there are a lot of challenging LN density, speed, and even release sections to an extent. Though, the name of the game really here is that long note density section at the second map. I mean, imagine playing jumpstreams but instead of just playing them like regular notes, you essentially need to glue your fingers to the keyboard just to not miss. In general, playing Long Notes can really be difficult for players who are not exactly adept to holding the keys for long periods of time; however, this is certainly a great way to practice and sort of introduce yourself to the LN Inverse/Density department.

Not to mention, rates are also featured here if you thought 1.0 wasn't hard enough. There are just so many ways where this song could be expressed, and this map shows two different methods of doing so. Found this interesting? Well, then don't break anyone's mood, and give this map a vote for Loved!

This song had a good amount of notoriety due to the [7K set](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/379758#mania/831951)'s existence back in the older days of mania's lifespan. This eventually led to the 4K set you see here being uploaded a little over two years after. Having the same intent the 7K one had, you'll find a grand usage of 260 BPM jumpstreams and other 1/4 patterns throughout the higher difficulties. Looking at the bigger picture, however, you've got a full spread of difficulties for easy access to all players looking for more songs to play.

[Unlike Pluto - Painted Dreams](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1320897#mania) by [Amerom](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5691061)\

[Amerom](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5691061), formerly known as andreymc, has been a big name in the Brazilian community. They were a world-class international player especially in the long note department. It is only appropriate that they come up with this heavily release-oriented entry: *Painted Dreams*.

Long note maps have their own sort of cult following, especially since a lot of people tend to play them with ScoreV2 because the way long note releases are handled with it are substantially better than on ScoreV1. *Painted Dreams* is one such hidden gem that gets passed along between LN enthusiasts, and features very flowy long note releases that are quite challenging to get right. As a slow and not particularly dense or physical map, much of the challenge is going to be focused on accuracy rather than combo, and reading and executing those releases requires its own kind of training. We hope that the inclusion of this file in your library helps you parse through long notes a bit better overall.

Do you feel like keeping it in the shadows? You really don't know what we're going through, do you? Please don't be shy and get your vote in the thread.

[DJ SHARPNEL - CYBER INDUCTANCE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1240883#mania) by [kasam53](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12852407)\
191 – 229.2 BPM, 4:54 | 7.10★, 7.65★, 8.32★, 9.00★\

As you might have noticed, all of the 4K nominations this week are sets by mappers that are new to loved — and that continues in the realm of 7K. Introducing [kasam53](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12852407)'s *CYBER INDUCTANCE*!

DJ SHARPNEL songs have been extensively used across all keycounts for intense, rice-focused stamina marathons, and this is no exception. A song well known to any 4K player, the structure of these charts will surprise no one — dense and intense chordstreams with the few breaks DJ SHARPNEL put in the song.

This set comes with 2 difficulties: \[SAMTHER\], estimated by the mapper at ★20, is already a fierce challenge, but one that is taken to the next level by \[AAA\], a difficulty name that reminisces the classic [Japanese Transformation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/406332#mania/883028) chart, and signals the patterns that lay under its name. The chords in the streams here become fuller and fatter; what were chords of 3 or 4 notes in \[SAMTHER\] become 5 or 6, peaking the density available. Is that still not enough for you? kasam53 kindly provides rates at 1.1 and 1.2, estimating the 1.1 at a mighty ★★4.

All the DJ SHARPNEL enjoyers (I know there's lots of you) — we hope to see your votes here!

[TUYU - Itsuka Otona ni Nareru to Ii ne.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1783344#mania) by [Emida](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11937683)\

Welcome [Emida](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11937683) to the Loved voting! We introduce them to the Loved nominations with a multi-key set of [Itsuka Otona ni Nareru to Ii ne.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1783344#mania)!

Both the 4K and the 7K have similar charting styles in that they are based mostly on long note density. These LNs are simple, straightforward, and easy to achieve good accuracy on. Be mindful of the short slowdown SVs, though.

Noodle players across 4K and 7K are eating well this month. Be sure to support Emida in the Loved vote if you want to see more.

[NH22 - Corrosion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/787750#mania) by [drunkenstein](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4565389) and [eZmmR](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8647138)\

The onslaught of mixed keycount LN continues with *Corrosion*!

[drunkenstein](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4565389) and [eZmmR](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8647138) present us with a spectacle of noodle patterns across both 4K and 7K, all accompanied by a classic Newgrounds nostalgia track by NightHawk22. Both 4K difficulties have similar object counts — but don't be fooled, as \[Virtuoso\] (and especially its ending) is significantly harder than the OD0 \[Scattered Thoughts\].

But let's turn our attention to the 7K \[Masterpiece\]. Did you know eZmmR maps 7K as well? Well now you do! This is definitely not a beginner's work. The music, while important, takes a backstep behind a fantastic array of patterns: hybrid streams, trills, noodle sweeps, shields, reverse shields, everything in between and more, seamlessly transitioning from one to another over the intense synth, piano and guitar techno.

Will this set reach loved status? Or will it stay in the graveyard limbo? You have to power to decide!
