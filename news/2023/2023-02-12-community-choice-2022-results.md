You've had your say, and the results are in! Find out which maps are the Community Choice and Mapper's Favourite from 2022 for each mode!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/162/header.jpg)

In case you missed it, the Community Choice polls are an extra special event we host each year where the community huddles close and votes for their favourite maps from the past year. The mapping community gets a nod too in their very own Mapper's Favourite category, which counts only the votes of anyone who's ever ranked a beatmap or guest difficulty.

Note: this year, the Mapper's Favourite category *only considers mappers that have had at least 1 map ranked in the contest's respective game mode*. Someone who ranked a map in osu!taiko no longer has their vote count towards the osu!catch Mapper's Favourite category, for example. This should help make the results a bit more accurate overall compared to previous years.

Additionally, every person who has outwardly contributed to a winning mapset for either Community Choice picks or Mapper's Favourite picks will receive the profile badge prize, and the osu! supporter prize will be divided among all contributors, with every contributor receiving at least 1 month's worth of osu!supporter no matter how many there are. You might understand why we made these changes as you read on!

With all that out of the way, let's get stuck straight into the results:

### Community Choice

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-02-12-community-choice-2022-results/non-breath-oblige.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1889729)

Seizing the lead in both the Community Choice with an absolutely dominating performance is [**15 Voices - Non-breath oblige**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1889729) by [**Delis**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1603923), featuring guest difficulties from [Trynna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2652951), [Dumii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3068044), [allein](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6221637), [Mirash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2841009), [toybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2848604) and [Silverboxer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2166762), plus the nomination prowess of [Ryuusei Aika](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7777875) and [UberFazz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8646059).

Let's just get it out in the air straight away: it wasn't even close. *Non-breath oblige* pulled out so many stops that practically every other map in the running was left wondering what a stop even was in the first place. The result was so decisive and one-sided that we had to check to make sure something wasn't broken with a whopping **1,278** votes — the closest competitor in second had only *778*. Damn.

The votes just kept coming on repeat. On repeat. On repeat. On repeat. On repeat. On repeat. On repeat. Such is the power of *Non-breath oblige*.

### Mapper's Favourite

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-02-12-community-choice-2022-results/heathens.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1851103)

2022 was the year of heresy as far as the mapping community was concerned as they cast **42** votes for the monster collab in [**twenty one pilots - Heathens (Magnetude Bootleg)**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1851103), showcasing the talents of [**funny**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8473573), [Sharu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5597639), [0ppInOsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12551840), [Halgoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4109923), [enryotoki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10639122), [Rorupan L9](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9471638), [Xarr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7262065) and [-Doodle](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12337329) for the world to see. Can't forget the nominators involved in the process too, namely [SMOKELIND](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9327302) and [Sajinn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13513687).

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-02-12-community-choice-2022-results/gyakkou.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1523018)

...but that's not all! [**Soushi Sakiyama - Gyakkou**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1523018) hosted by [**Gillstar**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7948210) kept up every step of the way with **42** votes of its own, with some guest difficulty help from the mapping talents of [Myxo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2202645), [amity](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10676118), [toybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2848604) (again) and [Fixxis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4673089), plus some beatmap nomination from [Akito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5716327) and [Fisky](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8352623).

Yep, that's right — a *two-way tie* for the spot of Mapper's Favourite. A certain non-obliging breath wasn't far behind either! Take that, mapping Twitter.

### Community Choice

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-02-12-community-choice-2022-results/truth.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1859338)

[**GTS Sound Team - \<\<\/nttld.:beings\>\> \~Truth in Uncertainty\~**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1859338) is a collaboration of absolutely titanic proportions, demonstrated not only by its *enormous* contributor list (which we will proceed to share in a moment), but also by its substantial **96** vote total, leading over the closest competitor by a considerable margin.

Okay, deep breaths. Here we go.

With more people than an average game development team dedicated to one piece of art alone, the sheer level of creativity involved in this piece simply cannot be understated. Melding so many ideas and styles together is an absolutely herculean effort, one that the osu!taiko community clearly recognises in full.

The acclaim for [**GTS Sound Team - \<\<\/nttld.:beings\>\> \~Truth in Uncertainty\~**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1859338) continued strongly in the mapping scene, though with *that* many osu!taiko mappers involved in its creation from start to finish, it isn't too surprising.

Players clearly enjoyed the chordjack madness and judging from the fierce competition in the set's leaderboards, things aren't likely to change on that front any time soon.

### Mapper's Favourite

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-02-12-community-choice-2022-results/eternal-white.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1683685)

Taking the top spot with a decent lead is [**shimizushi - Eternal White**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1683685) by [**Seiran-**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14351534), featuring guest difficulties from [Syadow-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3484485), [RiceSS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8271436) and [\_Hikari](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7109287), escorted into Ranked by the guiding nominator-hands of [gzdongsheng](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8660315) and [Muse Dash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13695676).

It is rumoured (jokingly) that in the osu!mania community, a map's worth can be measured by how many contentious comments it has. In *Eternal White*'s case, this means it may be one of the most valuable maps to hit Ranked in the past three years.
