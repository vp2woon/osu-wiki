6 years on, Project Loved is going strong!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

Welcome or welcome back to another edition of Project Loved! For those who are not yet familiar with who we are and what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As we usually do, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the August votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

Before we get into the picks for September, we would like to take a moment to thank *you*! Yes, ***you***! For helping us keep Project Loved alive.

September 2023 marks our **6th year of operation**, with the first ever round of Project Loved, formerly Loved Captain's Pick, debuting all the way back in September of 2017! Time sure flies when you're having fun, huh? If you want a real trip down memory lane or if you're a big osu! history buff, head on over to check out the [first ever news post about Loved Captain's Pick](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-09-25-introducing-the-loved-captains-pick)! If that's not enough for you, our very own [MegaMix_Craft](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711) has made a handy website to view [every single Project Loved news post that's ever been made](https://megamix.dev/lvd/newsposts_list/)! If you want to see how Project Loved has changed over the years, there's no better way than this!

We would like to also extend a big thank you to the original pioneers of Project Loved, [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689) and [Kaifin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596942), as well as [anyone and everyone involved throughout the years](https://loved.sh/contributors), big or small, for planting the seed that would eventually bloom into the Project Loved we have today. None of this would have been possible without the assistance from the osu! team either, but an especially big thank you goes to the one and only [swole seagull](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335) for their continued assistance whenever we encounter speed bumps along the way.

In light of this anniversary, you might notice that this month's selection for maps is considerably larger than previous rounds, with a whopping **40 maps nominated**, so we hope you enjoy the grander selection in celebration of this momentous milestone!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-09-20-project-loved-six-years-september-2023/threshold.png)

In more exciting news for those who are following along, the osu! captain team has decided to lower their approval requirement for Loved votes to be more in line with the other game modes. For the past few years, the voting threshold for a nominated osu! set has been 85%, while all the other modes have had their approval rate set at 80%. Starting September 2023 (that's now!), any nominated osu! set needs **80% approval** to enter the Loved category, including the nominations from this round, finally unifying all game modes! We will be monitoring how things go with this change and make adjustments if need be. Do let us know your feedback either in the osu! Project Loved Discord server linked above, or in the `#osu-loved` channel in the official [osu! development server](https://discord.gg/ppy)!

There's a common saying within the osu! community. I think it goes something like "you're here forever". In that light, we'd like to welcome back a returning Project Loved member: [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063)! While not quite going back to the exact same roles as before, they are rejoining the metadata team to assist with the workload of ensuring that maps up for vote have as accurate metadata as they can have! Another alumni returning from the grave is [Irisu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8595858), returning to the team after a break as a description reviewer! Welcome back, and never forget the sacred saying.

Next month we might have something even more special than what we have prepared for this month, so make sure to stay tuned!

That's all we have to share on the news front for Project Loved, let's finally get into the picks for September 2023:

[Aether Realm - Tarot](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1291247#osu) by [ItsWinter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6381153)\
190 BPM, 3:16 | 6.79★\
*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

An acclaimed custom map for the [osu! World Cup 2020](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2020), this month's *Popular Playcount* is none other than [Tarot](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1291247#osu/2680248) from our very own Featured Artists, [Aether Realm](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/47), and mapped by [ItsWinter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6381153)!

Sitting at a solid 190 BPM, 6.8★, and 160K playcount, there's a reason this map has reached the acclaim in solo and tournament usage alike. For 3 minutes, you get only the highest quality of streams in purified, liquid form. I hope you enjoy this feast. Impeccable flow, perfect spacing, ingenious patterns — truly, what more can you ask for?

If you find yourself as in love as myself, vote yes to see it in Loved!

*description written by [Kingling](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7010761)*

This month's *Popular Playcount* pick comes from none other than the legend that is [Silverboxer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2166762)!

Played over 140,000 times, his take on [Logic - Homicide](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/988751#osu/2068897) throws endless jumps at you for almost 2 minutes straight, giving you absolutely no chance to rest. And if that wasn't enough, the map is a whopping 7.89★, making this a true test of skill. Do you think you can pass it? Go and give it a try! The HP rating is only 4, after all... maybe you will surprise yourself!

If you still love it as much as I do after playing it, make sure to head over and vote yes to see it in the Loved category!

[Susumu Hirasawa - The Secret of The Flowers of Phenomenon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/70247#osu) by [jesse1412](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/230116)\

If you've listened to my old man's ramblings when I nominated *Welcome to my Fuckin' Flower Garden!!*, you're welcome to listen to another tale from simpler times for this month's Outstanding Oldies pick. If not... Well, go play your, uh, *Chika Chikas* and *Padorus*... that's what the kids are playing nowadays, right? ...no?

In the distant past of the year 2012, making very difficult maps wasn't exactly a mainstream thing. It was becoming quite popular after some guy mapped that one Big Black song, but the big deal was that there really weren't many top players making these kinds of difficult maps. Cut to [jesse1412](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/230116), one of the biggest speed pioneers in osu!. If today's people are setting crazy Wooting scores worth thousands of pp, jesse was one of the first few who were mashing their keyboards to a great degree of success. However, while his... exotic sense of humour would often create [less serious maps](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/90893), he's also known from Loved standouts such as [Arabian Rave Night](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/514121#osu/1092234) and [Bandiria Travellers](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/51391#osu/157582).

And much like *Bandiria Travellers*, having jesse's Kirby Mix-inspired mapping with that one special touch that only a top player could achieve, [The Secret of The Flowers of Phenomenon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/70247#osu/201974) would also be a hit. It's unpolished, it's simple... but it's also one of the most fun beatmaps of the era, with a few twists on some well-known old-style patterns that really make you realize just how much of a brilliant mind jesse1412 had.

If you're interested in these tidbits of osu! history making their way into the Loved section, make sure to give this a try and your vote!

145 BPM, 3:42 | 5.53★\
*description written by [rHO](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1629553)*

This month's *Small Spectacles* will be [pocket-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6808091)'s map of Kero Kero Bonito's [The Princess and The Clock](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1492284#osu)!

Through his graceful usage of the editor, pocket- manages to work his sliders and patterns, creating this magnificent map of *The Princess and The Clock*. It appears simplistic at first, yet sophisticated when you look more into it. I don't know what it is, really — there's a certain *je ne sais quoi* that pulls you in to his maps, and this one isn't an exception to that either (and I highly suggest looking up his other ones as well). If you're a fan of sliders or Kero Kero Bonito or you just want a great map to experience, you've got your answer right here.

[Konshasu THOUGHTS x ID Chief x Aloe Island Posse - Space Cowboys](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1115992#osu) by [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)\
120 BPM, 3:56 | 7.95★\
*description written by [Skill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7802027)*

The *Daredevil Difficulty* for this month is [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)'s map of [Konshasu THOUGHTS x ID Chief x Aloe Island Posse - Space Cowboys](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1115992#osu/2331367), an absolute banger.

This map is a pure consistency test, featuring a ton of jumps and bursts, but the aim is really what's out to get you on this. Nearly 4 minutes of 240 BPM nonstop pause-and-start jumps, but beware of the bursts littered throughout the later parts of the map. They might catch you off guard while you're jamming out to this vaporwave funk banger, but I'm sure the map will leave you nodding your head to the song before it hits you. This map is a staggering **7.99★** but the gist of this is that it's consistently that difficult, not significantly spiking at any point, making for an unrelenting aim consistency challenge.

Want to see this map enter Project Loved? Leave it your vote!

This month's *Gameplay Gimmicks* pick could very well be described as a rather iconic *Ranked Reject*. Ladies and gentlemen, [Hollow Wings](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/416662)' beatmap of [LiSA - ADAMAS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/868652#osu).

Anyone who has been playing osu! for long enough knows Hollow Wings' distinct approach to mapping, and you don't get to create that kind of reputation without being outstanding at what you do. Here's another one of HW's prized creations, this time challenging the player to rethink the entire concept of doubles. No singletapping allowed here, kids! Of course, as this was a beatmap that went quite far into the ranking process before being abandoned, it has an entire set of difficulties if you feel like the top difficulty is too spicy for you.

Do you think we should get more *HW goodness* in the Loved section? Make sure to make your opinion count by voting yes on this beatmap!

This bite-sized 1:00 length beatmap features nonstop 155 BPM streams, jumps and many more unique patterns, with an explosive ending. Join Madoka in her transformation from a magical girl into one of Niconico's top remixers in 2014! I want to be a DJ just like her when I grow up!

Only falling short of 84.55% in the last voting, this one deserves a second chance in my opinion. If you've been around (and I really mean *around*), chances are *Trapce* was in your radar at some point. *Trapce* is a party of overlapping circles and sliders and relentless patterns — a classic gimmick/reading map from at least a decade ago (the submission date is pretty misleading). This was rather the stepping stone for these types of "gimmick" maps — like a father of sorts. Beloved by [many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9rC0zbzCa4) [renowned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHx3ff0xeA) [players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzpmYIsJFvw) throughout the years, this deserves its place on Loved at last.

September's *Chill Champions* goes out to all the orbits! A little belated, but this pick is dedicated to Chuu's independence day with a mapset of [LOONA/Chuu - Heart Attack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/777099#osu/1632633) hosted by our very own Featured Artist and veteran mapper [happy30](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/317) featuring guest difficulties by [ReFaller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4841608) and [PandaHero](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1233255)!

Staying true to the *Chill Champions* title, this map sits at 4.15★ and is mapped in a simple yet elegant style. If you're a more casual and laid-back player, then the lower difficulties are what you're looking for.

If this map is also enough to attack your heart, why not head on over to the thread to cast your vote?

And one more thing... Stan LOONA

Did someone say... Cattle Decapitation in the osu! Loved category!? First popularised over 4 years ago by speed legend [Informous](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4734244) with his FC, [Circo Inhumanitas](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/696666#osu) has since been a staple map in every high-tier stamina player's collection. With players like [yary](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13300203) and [ninerik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10549880) bringing this map back into the limelight in recent times, both with FCs worth over 1000 pp no less, what better time to give this map a leaderboard and let people compete to be the ultimate stamina player?

Whether you want a new map to practice your stamina skills with or, like me as a stamina scrub, just want to sit back and watch the professionals battle it out, make sure you vote yes and watch the chaos unfold!

More jump maps in Project Loved? Yes. This map pushes your aim to the limit — **9.10★** is no joke after all. Filled with jumps and bursts at just under 3 minutes, this map is the territory for the best of the best aim players, but don't worry! If the circles are too big for you, there's a CS 3.3 difficulty to make your life just a tad bit easier. Gathering 32,000+ plays and 100+ favorites in just over a year definitely shows that it is *Loved* by many, just like me.

Mapped by [Waribashi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2250574) (formerly known as *KTYN*), [rejection - Aimai Attitude (feat. Nakamura Sanso)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1261099) is a classic stamina map that can be enjoyed by players of a wide skill range with NM or DT, even being featured as a DT2 pick in [TWC 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2023) recently. Using a mix of 1/6 bursts and less common patterns such as (kddd) and dkk, this map provides an interesting challenge while remaining faithful to the song, with visual effects such as a 1/1 bar line section that makes it engaging and fun to play throughout!

Did you enjoy playing this map? Well, don't sit there with an *Aimai Attitude* and vote for it today!

Showing incredible skill at mapping tech, he proficiently matches this incredibly sweet, nostalgic and equally unsettling song with his flowy, logical patterns, both chaotic and terrifying.

At 2:47 in length, this is a rather short experience, but quite an enjoyable one, as this is easily one of the most fun tech maps ever done. Have fun!

For those that do, they know that this incredibly good hidden gem is one of those delicacies of the past before all those pp reworks that hindered the creation of these exquisite beatmaps full of 1/6 patterns, requiring both great stamina and skill to get a perfect score.

It may look a little puny with its current star rating of 6.16★, but let me tell you in advance: this map really packs quite a punch. Not convinced? Try tacking on a mod! Its SV changes give a lot of breathing room for different mods, and it's quite refreshing with them. Have fun!

6 whole years of Project Loved. Almost 7 years from osu!taiko's first solo set by the one and only [Firce777](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/274072) pushed to the Loved category. We have come a long way since then, and to celebrate all those years, we think that there's no better way to do this than bringing an early-day classic such as [mafumafu - Yuugure Semi Nikki](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/83519) by the eternal [-\[ ix Ishida xi \] -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/242910), a map that after 10 years of its upload still finds itself being put in multiplayer lobbies and tournaments.

Truly a map that survived the test of time. It would be a complete miss from our side not to even give this map a chance to go through the voting process. Now it's time for you to try this map and go on a journey through the old osu!taiko days!

These combine to make a less stressful but very enjoyable and satisfying difficulty!

Waribashi's difficulty, *huh?*, is a very fun technical map that consists of far more frequent and more difficult 1/6 patterns than the previous difficulty, as well as repeatedly using 3/16 doublets. Make sure you're also prepared for the two 100+ note streams at the very end of the map! Do you have what it takes?_?

Well class, welcome to the pinnacle of scientific and genius mapping expression.\
6 years. 6 years, 3 maps because I always like my cup half full.\
Am I pessimistic or an optimistic? Not even I know.\
Am I rambling? ...no.

Is Camellia rambling? Not sure.\
But [Razor Sharp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3414261) definitely wasn't.

With his hyperwalk expressions and equations, we calculate the SR to be an exact 10.08★. We call this "Razor's constant" in chemistry terms. And so, for your chemistry lab next week, I must ask you to do one simple step. Vote on this map and give your opinion. But you may ask me, "Dr. Fuhie, what are the directions for the lab? We are broke college chemistry students with no experience."

Ok, well... I'm getting paid to teach you, so here's the breakdown.

1. Load the map on "osu.exe", then open the editor.\
2. Notice the map's consistency and unusual pattern usage (hyperwalks, wiggles, bursts). Very peculiar, yeah?\
3. Experiment with the map, open the F1 menu on the song select screen and apply NF. You don't want to wear your lab coat and lab goggles? Okay, I don't care. Play with No Mod then. My safety is not your concern.

So, prove to me. Are you the Marie Curie of cooking? Do you have what it takes to perfect Razor Sharp's TERROR?

So class, my second lecture. We may be in chemistry class, but lets talk about space.

Apollo-11 took 3 days, 3 hours and 49 minutes to get to the moon. Does anyone know the MINIMUM speed you must travel to escape Earth and to reach the moon?

Yes, Jeremy. 11 km/s is the correct answer.

So, let's go on to a harder question. How many days will it take you to FC the entire set of *Apollo* in osu! utilizing the game mode osu!catch?\
...We have no idea..?\
Okay, well you've all failed your pre-class examination. You may leave.

HOWEVER!!

You can stay if you listen to me explain more in-depth about what this *Apollo* map by [Dahcreeper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6926006), [Enjuxx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10727985), [GiGas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7300747), [Rocma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276), and [Secre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2306637) is about.

So, utilizing Dahcreeper's *Theory of Wiggle and AR Reading*, we see the relationship between Dahcreeper and crazy gimmick/jump patterns. So, you apply the Dahcreeper constant to your method of gameplay (NoFail, No Mod, Hard Rock), and you realize that only one option works. No Fail. Why is that? Because under Dahcreeper's constant, there is no margin of success for you as a prospective science student to achieve such a feat as these gentlemen did by landing 5 men on the moon. Pick your poison, which astronaut out of the 5 do you want to try and defeat?

Can you take your spot on the next moon expedition?

Okay, class. Last lecture of the year. Don't slack off, you still have work to do. This time, with this new concept of "[ExileLord - Hollow](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/787595#fruits)" created by the scientist "Kryptic [Kyptoric](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1361268)". Yes, I have kept this concept out of this semester's syllabus because I wanted to surprise you to hopefully make you fail the course; I want to make you take this course over and over again because I want you to pay me more money.

Anyways, onto the lecture.

The coordinates utilized on this map are of near perfection for this final exam. It tests all your skills that I have hopefully convinced you to learn over the semester. Be careful though, there are those pesky hyperwalks from "Razor's Constant" that you need to calculate. Don't forget significant figures; round to 8 decimal places as I want you to be perfect but also fail this course.

Fail fail fail.

Don't I sound *Hollow*?

Let me make myself clear. Transparent. The reason I am so *Hollow* is because "Kryptic Kyptoric" has published this concept of *"ExileLord - Hollow"* for years. It's just been overlooked quite a bit. I'm utilizing it now for your final exam because it perfectly slots into your course with the concepts I have taught you over the last 2 months.

Hyperwalks? Dahcreeper's *Theory of Wiggle and AR Reading*? Don't you remember all the previous material that I just crammed into your head over the last 6 minutes? I hope you don't, because you won't see what's coming with this devious paper I am passing out to you this September.

Good luck on your final exam, and put on No Fail unless you feel like you can out-school your professor. Let's dance.

It is filled to the brim with kick sliders, requiring you to tap-dash most of them. Now, of course, most of those sliders also have a bunch of droplets, making it extra hard to even get some decent accuracy or even hold a combo if you are not used to the patterns. To top it all off, it has a circle size of 5, making the fruits extra small and giving you yet another challenge.

[Yumeno Himiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1806962) is back with another map up for Loved! They already have quite an amount of maps Loved, but maybe there is that one particular ZUN map you remember which was Loved 2 years prior. If you do, then you know what to expect from this map.

For modern mapping, it is usually essential to use hyperdashes when necessary. But what if a map just does not use them at all? This map is exactly that. Lots of small and precise jumps that are sometimes really difficult to time correctly and a lot of streams and patterns that require you to wiggle. Well, technically you can catch most of it without wiggling and just using sheer precision, but that does not make it easier at all. The average player will have a tough time with this map as it requires a very unique skill set to do good at it and most people don't have it anymore. Nevertheless, it is a good challenge map for testing your timing and reading skills.

Give it a try — it might be a bit different from what you are used to, but sometimes it is worth it to step out of your comfort zone!

You want to be a fighter pilot. But I can't let you be that since we need you to pass the army test.

Finally, the moment you have all been waiting for.

[Tidek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/743282)'s SV interpretation of *Symphony Op.1*. Where do I even start? For those unfamiliar with it, *Symphony Op.1* was the harder entry of the [Grand Finals round of the osu!mania 4K World Cup 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K#grand-finals). That in itself should tell you a lot about where it stands in terms of difficulty — if you didn't get it, it's *really hard*.

The map itself has too many things to mention in a news post, but it is very well worth it to just take a look with the Auto mod, as its value already stands out in terms of visuals and flashiness. I do want to say, as an SV mappool selector for [MWC 4K 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K), that *Symphony Op.1* was definitely too hard for a team-based competitive setting. Nevertheless, Tidek's creation has received critical acclaim as a standalone boss challenge for seasoned and aspiring SV players alike throughout the year. It only makes sense for us to immediately put it up with 12 months of age, especially to celebrate Project Loved's sixth year anniversary!

Many of you have asked for a leaderboard on this map. Put your actions where your mouth is, and vote in the thread!

[Evening](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2193881) once again returns to the Project Loved scene, as they present you with one of their many additions to the Project Loved scene: [Lazorbeamz](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1858524#mania/3820264)!

This map is notorious for being the final chart of REFORM Dan Alpha, which is the bridgeway between the courses under the numerical system of the Greek alphabet. Not only does this throw you into high-BPM jumpstreams, but it also is relentless with barely any breaks at all. Adding onto that, this map features in a mix of jumptrills and one-hand trills, making the stamina factor much more difficult. In the end, if you are able to handle 2 minutes and 34 seconds of jumpstream madness, then this map certainly is for you.

If 264 BPM is not enough for you however, rates from 1.05x up to 1.6x have also been added to this set. This can range from a BPM of 273 up to a whopping 416 BPM! Do you have what it takes to challenge this at a faster speed? Show your support for [Evening](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2193881) by giving this map a favorable vote.

This month, [isokasapupuja](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1770462), is finally getting their first Loved nomination with their chart of [Tokyo Ghetto](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1324319#mania/2743106)!

Chances are you're either very familiar with this person's charts, or don't know them for much. Most of them have been uploaded on *Etterna* rather than osu!, as this chart was featured in the pack [cesspool of ribal 3](https://etternaonline.com/pack/76863), but ended up on osu! due to [Speed of Light 2: Lucha Libre Edition](/wiki/Tournaments/SOL/2020) using it as a pick in their Semifinals mappool. While other tournaments have used their charts, leading them to being uploaded, this one has managed to stand out greatly, as it's ended up gaining tons of popularity and respect.

Being a fairly straightforward vocal dump, most of the difficulty comes from the constant 1/8 streams with a fair amount of doubles mixed in, leading to a speed chart with much more quality and thought put into it. Clocking in at nearly 4 minutes, you'll be finding yourself quite the stamina-draining challenge if you like streams with the added technicality of vocal focus. Go give it your vote!

We see another mapper new to Loved this month with [Sherie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9113475) and their map of [Karma](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1158618#mania/2889384).

Many may think that this is just your ordinary jumpstream chart, but looks can be very deceiving. Instead, as soon as you start playing this map you are blasted with a multitude of trilly patterns which feel just so satisfying to play. This map is also relentless with the consistent amount of minijacks that are layered thought the entire map to truly test your physicality. If that isn't enough for you, there are also rates added on to test and refine your skills!

If you want to be able to support this map, be sure to cast your vote or else you may find yourself getting some bad *Karma*!

[Monheim](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6814203) has become very well known for being both a chordjack player and chordjack charter. This month, they're making a return to the Loved section with their chart of [KAMISORI](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/790716#mania/1659079)!

First featured in the [MWC 4K 2018](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2018_4K) Semifinals, it's managed to maintain a following due to how it sticks out from your average chordjack chart. Consisting of 135 BPM jacks, it manages to deviate from what's considered straightforward and incorporates a large amount of awkward bursts to keep an accurate representation of the song. It may not be for everyone, but the uniqueness is a great quality for why it's managed to stick out so much. If you'd like to try your hand at something different compared to typical chordjack layering, make sure to give it some support!

Let's be real here for a second — how many notecharters can you think of that can trigger nostalgia over some 2016–2017 charts that were so simple in their layering, or even their mild SV usage? I don't think there are that many, especially when you consider the fact that the 2016–2017 era was a period that had a significant boom in how people approach their charts, and not just relying on rice and rice only. For this wave, we have this kind of pick for you that might raise your eyebrows a bit. Presenting [ALEFY](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1291769)'s [Harajuku Iyahoi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/561722#mania)!

As far as history goes, it's only ALEFY that managed to sustain their charting style over the years. If you take a closer look on their discography for a bit, their charts usually go like this: mild-moderate layering depending on the song, and some memorable SVs that make every single chart made by them distinctive from one another. SV usage was something of a rarity even back then; it's not really just a simple bump or speedup teleport, but it's manipulative BPM changes that achieve all of those effects at once. It just feels... bouncy, for a lack of a better word.

With a song that garners widespread attention, this chart just really works with that kind of gimmick. Apart from being used in multiple tournaments back in the day, there's not a whole to lot say about its legacy. If you want this chart to shine a new light and revive into something preserved in the Loved catalogue, do your job and support this pick!

[Player0](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3662205) gives you another challenge at a storyboard map, as they present you with: [GHOST](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1248233#mania/2594303)!

At first, [GHOST](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1248233#mania/2594303) forces you to play with a white-colored bar skin, regardless of whichever one you use right now, whether that's arrows, circles, or any other note type. This may seem easy to be able to adjust to, until it suddenly throws a barrage of gimmicks at you such as the notes fading in, changing position, hiding only a select few notes, and even the entire playfield just flashing the entire time!

Not to mention, those gimmicks are paired with some difficult patterns such as splittrills, minijacks, long note release, and even rolly bursts, which could really make your accuracy go much lower.

Ready to face the difficulties of gimmicks and patterning? Do you just want to see the beauty of how far osu!mania storyboard maps can go? Maybe you just want to see how the best of the best players can play such an insane chart like this?

Then support the mapper by giving them a favorable vote! You never know, maybe YOU will be the one to be able to challenge the best players in the world on a difficult map like this.

Now for the first time in the Loved category we see [guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065). With that being said, many will know guden from their numerous number of ranked maps as well as the popularity of their maps as tourney picks.

For this month we will be seeing *Desperado Waltz*, most well known for being originally used in Quarterfinals for both [SOFT 6](/wiki/Tournaments/SOFT/6) and later used in [MWC 4K 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K). As a result, this map's popularity has skyrocketed due to the relentless difficulty of the density.

With the addition of rates to this map there is a wide variety of difficulty to be able to challenge yourself on. If you are interested in this chart, be sure to vote "yes" this month.

While [Lung_P](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8271308) has a Loved guest difficulty from the past, he does not have a Loved set of his own. This will hopefully change with our introduction of his set of [Gimmme!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1712056#mania)

Easy-going chordstreams is not something Lung_P is typically known for, but we feel that this chart is worth a chance given its simplicity. It has a similar approach to [kasumi99](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13191908)'s [Protoflicker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1026167), although the chordstreams contain fewer brackets and is generally a little easier for people to get into.

Most of our recent 7K Loved picks have been too difficult for the majority of the playerbase to try out, but striking a good balance between those picks and simple picks is probably in order. If you agree with this, make sure to *Gimmme* your vote!

It has been a while since we've seen a basic LN density pick from [Flexo123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5367287), but we return to one of the types of charts he is most known for with his chart of [Mermaid girl (STARLiGHT Mix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/955167#mania).

This is the kind of chart that is most well received by intermediate-level LN players. The simplicity of the patterns here make for an approachable chart, and there is nothing too complicated here. This caused its popularity to hold up very well over the years.

Many of our recent LN picks have been quite challenging for most of osu!mania's 7K players, so we want to ease up on the difficulty with something simpler. Hopefully, more of you can enjoy this month's easier LN pick.

[Dety](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8716749) (also known as Destiny19) is back with his chart of [Mmmmmmm](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/673718)!

This chart garnered attention in both the osu!mania and O2Jam communities, and it definitely demonstrated its longevity across both of them too. [Dety](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8716749)'s unique and symmetrical charting style is well known to *O2Jam* players for both its structure and difficulty. This chart is not easy to combo with its LN streams and heavy LN chords with variable release timings, but being able to string everything together and get a nice score on Destiny's charts feels very rewarding.

The reception to our *O2Jam*-style picks has been very positive, and it is clear that we need to be nominating these far more often. Make sure to vote for [Mmmmmmm](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/673718) this month.

As part of celebrating **six years** of Project Loved, we will be nominating two anti-meta sets. Our first nomination is a 6K set for beginners: [QQwiwi2012](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1757117)'s [6K Starter Practice Pack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1640166#mania)!

6K is easily the most popular anti-meta key mode by far. Other low-level 6K packs in the Loved category receive amounts of plays that far exceed the vast majority of even Ranked spreads in osu!mania. However, we have the lowest-level 6K nomination yet. With star ratings on some of the charts going below 1, anyone reading this can jump in and try 6K right now!

We hope this nomination will be well received, as many players in the community have a soft spot for 6K. If you want to see more 6K in the Loved category, please give it your support in the voting stage!

[Flow (Part 1)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1105209#mania) is part of a series of 4 low/mid-difficulty 10K sets designed for mostly beginners ranging up to intermediate players. Similar to this month's 6K nomination, this 10K set has some of the easiest charts so far. If you want to get into 10K, this set is a good avenue to start.

The 10K+ community is very dedicated to the key mode, and we continue to recognize this dedication by offering some 10K charts for Loved. We hope anyone reading this can have a taste of 10K with this nomination!
