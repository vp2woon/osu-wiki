Announcing the 7th installment of the Monthly Beatmapping Contest - but this time across all game modes. Celebrating the anniversary of mode-specific BATs, we opened this Monthly Beatmapping Contest for osu!, Taiko, Catch the Beat and osu!mania.

We consequently opened the contest with four different brackets. You are allowed to submit your map in as many brackets as you wish, but you can only win once.

The song for this contest is **Soleily - Renatus**. You may listen to a short preview below:

## What are the prizes?

- 6 months of supporter for you or a friend!
- 'Elite Mapper' forum title
- **Winning mapset will be bundled with the osu! game client download!**

## What are the rules?

- You must map 3 difficulties in an appropriate spread - either ENH (easy, normal and hard) or NHI (normal, hard, insane). This counts for all 4 brackets.
- In the osu!mania bracket, you may only submit difficulties with the same key amount.
- Collaboration is allowed, but will only be registered under the name of the person who submitted the beatmap. Prizes for a winning mapset will only be given to the uploader.
- Difficulty names must only be the name of the respective difficulty, and nothing else. No ztrot's Hard or anything comparable.
- Maps submitted to the contest must not be submitted to the BSS until the contest has concluded.
