Finally the performance rankings for Taiko, Catch the Beat and osu!mania reached a point where they can be used as official ranking systems. You can find your new rank in your profile and the performance ladder [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/pp).

I'd like to mention, that the performance ranking is in no way finalized and you can expect frequent changes to the ranking system especially in Taiko, Catch the Beat and osu!mania. Your feedback will be used to steer these changes.

Here are direct links to the feedback forum threads:

- [Standard feedback and suggestions](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/181850)
- [Catch the Beat feedback and suggestions](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/181851)
- [Taiko feedback and suggestions](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/181852)
- [osu!mania feedback and suggestions](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/181853)

Note, that standard players might also experience slight rank changes due to the difficulty algorithm migrating from the not perfectly accurate tp difficulty calculator to the osu! client.

## Plans for the future

As a part of setting the performance ranking up with all modes we now have a difficulty calculator base which is integrated into the osu! client. This means, that having a better star rating is only a few steps away.

Moreover we hope to include further difficulty information - for example aim difficulty and speed difficulty in standard osu! - in the website and in the client at some point.

Many other cool features are planned, but can not be discussed in detail here until they are finalized. Thank you for understanding. :)
