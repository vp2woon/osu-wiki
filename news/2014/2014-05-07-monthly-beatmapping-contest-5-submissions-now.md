Calling all mappers! After a brief hiatus, the Monthly Beatmapping Contest is back! With our heckles warmed from W h i t e's record breaking performance in our last MBC, it's time for a new track to spur our mappers to new heights of creativity!

The song choice for this month is Rameses B - Flaklypa, a remix of the The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix commissioned especially for a high-school graduation ceremony in Norway known as russefeiring (or simply, russ). A variety of layered sounds and beats add a Noisia-esque touch to this track, with dips and dives that are certain to bring out a glint in every astute mapper's eye. Listen to the song below:

(Note: a special cut version is used for the contest, that begins at roughly 0:53 and ends at ~3:58, reducing the overall duration of the song to 3:01)

## Prizes

- 6 months of supporter for you or a friend!
- An [osu!tablet](https://puu.sh/4KJjJ/fc3db59aa0.jpg) (when available).
- 'Elite Mapper' forum title
- **Winning mapset will be bundled with the osu! game client download!**

## Ruless

- You must map 3 difficulties in an appropriate spread - either ENH (easy, normal and hard) or NHI (normal, hard, insane).
- Collaboration is allowed, but will only be registered under the name of the person who submitted the beatmap.
- Difficulty names must only be the name of the respective difficulty, and nothing else. No ztrot's Hard or anything comparable.
- Maps submitted to the contest must not submitted to the BSS until the contest has concluded.

Download the base beatmap and enter [here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/contest?c=11).

The deadline for submission is the **8th of June**. Make sure you submit early and be prepared - we won't be accepting late submissions at all this time!

(Stay tuned for the next Monthly Beatmapping Contest.. We have a real treat lined up for everybody next month!)
