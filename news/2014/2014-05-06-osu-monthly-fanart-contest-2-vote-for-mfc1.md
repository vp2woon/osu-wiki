Hello again! Welcome to the second Monthly Fanart Contest! Each month we'll be suggesting a different theme for artwork. The first contest went overwhelmingly well! Last month we went with a basic theme, but this month, let's shake it up a bit:

**osu! Around the World!**

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2014-05-06-osu-monthly-fanart-contest-2-vote-for-mfc1/tumblr_inline_n54psdgsam1s6rj41.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/206852)

This is an intentionally open-ended theme, so go wild! Some possibilities include fanart of new or existing international osu! mascots, fanart of Pippi or other osu! characters in exotic or iconic worldwide locations, literal interpretations of the game of osu! being played or represented around the world, or anything else you can think of! Themes of travel and togetherness are what we have in mind. Once again a **[full one year supporter tag](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/support)** is up for grabs, and this time around we're offering the added incentive of the **[osu! tablet](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/169139)**, which should come in handy for drawing as well as playing.

Some Rules:

- Artwork must be, in some way, related to the month's theme. In this case, **osu! Around the world!**.
- Everything in your image must be **your own work**! Don't steal anyone's art, even for backgrounds.
- Don't include any copyrighted characters. Including your own original characters alongside osu! characters is fine.
- Images must be G-rated and safe-for-work
- Deadline for entries is **June 6th, 2014**.

## How to enter

**You must post a web-friendly (600px by 600px maximum) image in [the official contest thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/206852), and link to a much larger print-friendly image (at least *1000x1000*, as high as possible) for possible merch use. You can upload the images on <https://up.ppy.sh/> or <https://puush.me/>**

By entering, you agree to let us use your art on the osu! website, social media accounts, and merchandise. While this isn't a merch design contest per se, if we do decide to use your image on a t-shirt or other item, you will get a free one!

Only entries that follow all rules will be considered. There will be two winners each month, one chosen by public poll, and one chosen by osu! staff. Each winner will get a one-year osu! supporter tag and an osu! tablet.

Let me know if anything needs clarifying, otherwise, post away!

*So nobody feels left out, the two primary winners of last month's contest will also receive the osu!tablets. And because the quality and quantity of entries last month were so overwhelming, we'll also be giving out one-month supporter tags as consolation prizes to select favorites. If this month's contest is similar, we'll do the same thing again.
