Hello again! The results are finally in for the second official osu! fanart contest! It was very interesting seeing people take this fairly open-ended theme in different directions, and even more interesting to see how those different directions were reflected in the voting results.

The results are broken into two sections, the hard numbers of the public poll results, and the more subjective and personal choices of the staff picks. First place in each section wins a full year supporter tag, along with an [osu!tablet](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1) (or [Pippi plushie](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/3), if they prefer). The next four runner-ups in each section will each receive a one-month supporter tag. I've also listed five honorable mentions, who won't be getting prizes but whose art I felt deserved to be featured here as well. We'll be granting the supporter tags and contacting the first prize winners about the physical prizes in the next few days. If we use any of this art in upcoming merchandise, one of those will be given to the artist as part of the prize as well.

Finally, while Mocochia got some staff votes (and a significant number of public votes) for the entry above, I just want to call out Mocochia's other, more adorable entry, which I personally felt really fit what I had in mind for the theme of this contest:

So thank you all for participating in this contest. Don't feel bad if your entry wasn't featured, there were far too many amazing entries to highlight them all here, but I will again be posting every single entry on the [osu! facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/osugame/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums) in the coming weeks, because they all deserve recognition. Next contest should be starting soon, so stay tuned!
