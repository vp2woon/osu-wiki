While making continuous revisions to how this game and community is run, I have decided to remove download limitations for all users. Now that osu! is not so resource-limited, I see no reason to keep unlimited* downloads as an exclusive perk.

For those reading further into this, yes, there is still a sanity limit, but if you are hitting this without trying you are probably a bot. No, that is not a challenge :).

More [supporter](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/support) features are planned to be added in the near future, so stay tuned!
