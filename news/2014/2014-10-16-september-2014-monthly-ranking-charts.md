The Ranking Charts for September 2014 have just been released and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1409)! Along with that, we updated the [Ranking Charts long-term leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rgaKVJj_MDo0PwGrGXbKRVzjE9fhOUb4XZXRsOjTaoQ/edit) with the new results! Moreover, we published the [vote results here!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bQQsvecPxgHJtFTMGWjSj25FcCmhGu82M8jvvNoKOic/edit)

Keep in mind that the autumn season winner will be rewarded with an additional **3 months supporter tag** and the user title **Charts Champion** for 3 months. Moreover, if one of the current title holders wins the autumn season as well, they will be rewarded with an additional **6 months supporter tag** and the user title **Charts Grandmaster** for 3 months. The winner of each individual ranking chart will receive a 1 month supporter tag.

The charts have been created by letting the [CAT](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/21) and the Staff Members vote for the most noteworthy maps of each respective month. They will end on the 15th November 2014.
