After a number of delays, we'd like to proudly present the winners of the second Monthly Beatmapping Contest!

The competition was fierce this time, with barely three points between first and second place, and a paltry two points between second and third place! The gloves really came off, with our contestants pulling out their all to make what is undoubtedly the finest set of beatmaps we've seen so far.

After a painstaking month of deliberation, the judges have declared [**jonathanlfj**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/jonathanlfj) as the winner, with a cumulative score of **126**! Congratulations! Download the winning beatmap [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/140662)!

Honorable mentions go to [Niva](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Niva), whom scored second with a cumulative score of _123_, and [Reiji-RJ](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Reiji-RJ), whom came third with a cumulative score of _121_.

The winning map will be bundled with the game client in the coming months, and prizes will be sent out shortly. Thank you to everyone who participated, and we hope to see even more participants in the contests to come!

You may view the contest results [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/contestresults?c=8) at your leisure.
