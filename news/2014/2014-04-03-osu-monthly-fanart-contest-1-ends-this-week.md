Hello all! Announcing the first Monthly Fanart Contest!

[![Monthly Fanart Contest](/wiki/shared/news/2014-04-03-osu-monthly-fanart-contest-1-ends-this-week/tumblr_inline_n3fjpgTi5Z1s6rj41.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/198551/)

Each month we'll be suggesting a different theme for artwork, and two winners will each get a full **[one year supporter tag](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/support)**. This is intended to be kind of a fun, informal contest, but we still need some rules.

To start out simple, this month's theme is:

**Pippi, the osu! mascot!**

Big surprise there, I know. But to make things a bit more interesting (and to rule out existing artwork), let's focus on her new costume, as in the default comboburst, as seen in the image at the top of this thread. Want to redesign it? Sure, go for it! You won't be judged on accuracy. But we've already seen plenty of art of Pippi in her classic outfit (and if you want to draw more of that, please keep doing so in the main fanart thread!) so let's see some in the style of this new look.

Rules:

- Artwork must be, in some way, related to the month's theme. In this case, **current-costume Pippi**.
- Everything in your image must be **your own work**! Don't steal anyone's art, even for backgrounds.
- Don't include any copyrighted characters. Including your own original characters alongside osu! characters is fine.
- Images must be G-rated and safe-for-work
- You must post a web-friendly (600px by 600px maximum) image in **[the official contest thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/198551/)**, and link to a much larger print-friendly image (at least 1000x1000, as high as possible) for possible merch use.
- Deadline for entries is **May 1st, 2014**.

By entering, you agree to let us use your art on the osu! website, social media accounts, and merchandise. While this isn't a merch design contest per se, if we do decide to use your image on a t-shirt or other item, you will get a free one!

Only entries that follow all rules will be considered. There will be two winners each month, one chosen by public poll, and one chosen by osu! staff. Each winner will get a **[one-year osu! supporter tag](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/support)**.

Let me know if anything needs clarifying, otherwise, [post away](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/198551/)!

Edit: The contest ends soon! Everybody's been doing really well! I'm overwhelmed. Please have your entries in by the end of the day on May 1st.

**[Countdown Link](http://www.onlinecountdowns.com/countdown-clocks/event-name-countdown-clock-f793a6f3-326b-41df-806d-d600679a0ce2)**

I've created a countdown to 11:59pm (Easter Time) on that date, since that is when I'll lock the thread and collect submissions. It may take a day or two after that for me to get the poll set up for voting. Good luck everyone!
