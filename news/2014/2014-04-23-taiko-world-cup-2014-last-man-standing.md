Welcome! We would like to welcome you a spin-off of the official World Cups: the Taiko World Cup - Last Man Standing. Compared to the official Taiko World Cup, we have decided to change the rules up a little to create a different setting, so read them up [in our forum thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/192614/start=0).

In this tournament, both teams gather normally and choose a song as usual, but the player who does the worst on that song is eliminated and has to leave the match. The team that loses all their players first, loses the match and is eliminated from the tournament.

We're excited to see how this goes - we have been planning big, and we're hoping this tournament will turn out big! Everyone has a chance in this tournament, so we're hoping for a very large turnout of pro players and newcomers alike.
