The judging is finally complete - and a clear winner has been chosen. With the another perfect score awarded and one of the largest number of entries yet, MBC #5 has been utterly full of surprises!

[-kevincela-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/266596) left the judges awestruck with his set this time around, towering over other contestants with an 18 point lead - the largest of its kind since the MBC's introduction. grumd was utterly blown away by -kevincela-'s map, giving it the second perfect score the contest has seen so far.

Honourable mentions go to [Nichiyouki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1011056) and [-Chata-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/-Chata-), who scored second and third respectively with scores of 152 and 150.
