Hey peoples. Just a quick note that I have completely disabled the Performance Points as they were not calculating correctly over the last few months.

I will be performing maintenance on them over the coming week, and you can expect the system to return by the end of the weekend. In the mean time please take a break from the rank-chasing and chill in multiplayer, or compete for top ranks on those beatmaps/difficulties you love to play!
