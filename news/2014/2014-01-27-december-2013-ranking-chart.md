With a slight delay, here is the December Ranking Chart!

Like in the previous month, four of the maps were selected by the [CAT](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/21) and [BAT](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/7). Additionally, two of the picks were done by you, the community! This was calculated based on the online favourites, user ratings and number of plays on the maps ranked in November. You can see the new chart [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart). Due to the delay, this chart will run until 20th February 2014.
