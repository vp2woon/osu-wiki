It was only a matter of time until this skin got showcased, and here it is at last. I present to you, the NeOsu series.

[NeOsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/83087) was first submitted on the 5th of May in 2012 and is skinned for osu! standard, Taiko and Catch the Beat. A lot of the elements worked really well with each other, however there were some parts (like most of the Taiko graphics) that didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the skin. With some small fixes it could have been a really good skin; the author knew this, and released these fixes as a second skin.

On the 23rd of December, 2012, [OsuMe65](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/852867) uploaded [NeOsu 2 -The Second Generation-](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/110915), a newer version of his original skin. This included a different Taiko skin, cleaner, crisper skin elements and animated skin elements such as the back button and HP bar . Some elements, like the mod icons were completely changed, while some elements, like the menu-background-button, weren't changed that much at all.

[NeOsu 3 -The 3rd Innovation-](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/132898) The next version of NeOsu was uploaded on the 16th of June, 2013. OsuMe65 changed a lot in this version, adding HD support, skinning osu!mania and even further refining and polishing everything. This skin was now starting to look really amazing. The skin's execution was really well done, with all 4 game modes working really well with each other.

[AlterNeo](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/158729) was first submitted on the 6th of October 2012 and was a spin-off skin from NeOsu 3. This skin only focused on osu! standard and used red has a base colour scheme instead of blue. The skin does still contain elements straight from the NeOsu 3 skin though.

On the 25th of January 2014, [NeOsu Afterlife](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/181489) was finally uploaded after months of waiting. With not much new to add, this skin was more of a redesign than a fresh new update like NeOsu 2 and 3. Sadly, I feel that this skin should have been skinned for the new style skin behavior to keep up with recent skin changes, just as the previous version did. Perhaps we'll see this happen in future versions.

[NeOsu Symphonia](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/183350) was released not long after Afterlife, on the 1st of February 2014 and was skinned just for osu!mania. The playfield is monotone, keeping the design rather simple and basic, whereas other parts of the skin (such as mod icons and ranking letters) are fancy and complex.

As a final note, the main NeOsu series, AlterNeo and NeOsu Symphonia each have their own character. NeOsu has [Nekane Neo](http://photobucket.com/gallery/http://s1303.photobucket.com/user/stacking_lives/media/NeOsu/neo4_zpscb51667f.png.html). AlterNeo has [Alter N.
