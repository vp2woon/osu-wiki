The Ranking Charts for July 2014 have just been released and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1407)! Along with that, we updated the [long-term leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rgaKVJj_MDo0PwGrGXbKRVzjE9fhOUb4XZXRsOjTaoQ/edit) and published the [vote results here!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bQQsvecPxgHJtFTMGWjSj25FcCmhGu82M8jvvNoKOic/edit)

Keep in mind that at the end of each season, which concludes with the July 2014 Charts, the season winner will be rewarded with an additional **3 months supporter tag** and the user title **Charts Champion** for 3 months. The winner of each individual ranking chart receives a 1 month supporter tag.

The charts have been created by letting the the [CAT](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/21) and [BAT](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/7) vote for the most noteworthy maps of each respective month. They will end on the 15th September 2014.
