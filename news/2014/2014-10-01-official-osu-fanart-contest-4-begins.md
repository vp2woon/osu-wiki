Hi there! New osu! staffer here. I'll soon be taking over the running of the osu webstore (yes, that means restocked [osu! tablets](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1) soon!) but today I'm here to introduce the fourth Official osu! Fanart Contest! This time, things are getting spooky with the theme of...

We're talking skeletons, pumpkins, blood, ghouls and any other creepy crawly Halloween renderings of osu! and its characters that you can think up. Go crazy! Do you have the guts?

Well, I'm not going to stick around all day and make terror-ible Halloween puns, so let's discuss specifics....

Once again a [full one year supporter tag](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/support) is up for grabs, along with the [osu! tablet](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1), which should come in handy for drawing as well as playing. In addition to the grand prize winners, any artwork that gets used in any official format will win the artist a one-month supporter tag. Further compensation will be offered for any artwork that is used for official merchandise.

## Rules

- Artwork must fit theme. In this case, it must be **Halloween-themed** osu! artwork.
- Everything in your image must be your own work! Don't steal anyone's art, and please don't "trace" anything either. Make your own pose.
- Don't include any copyrighted characters from outside of osu! Including your own original characters alongside osu! characters is fine. Also, I know we only used Pippi examples in the banner, but we hope to see Yuzu and perhaps Pippidon represented this time around.
- Images must be G-rated and safe-for-work.
- Images must meet the size requirements.
- **Deadline for entries is October 27th, 2014.**

## How to Enter

- Post a web-friendly (370px wide by 320px maximum) image in [the official contest thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/247101)
- Link to a much larger print-friendly image (at least 1200x1200, preferably higher, or vector, if possible) for possible printing.
- You can upload the images on [https://up.ppy.sh/](https://up.ppy.sh) or [https://puush.me/](https://puush.me)
- You may enter more than one image, but you can only win one grand prize. If you have more than one entries, please keep them all in a **single forum post**.

By entering, you agree to let us use your art on the osu! website, social media accounts, and merchandise. We'll hopefully be using many of these entries in various web formats, and if we use your art in an official capacity you'll get a one-month supporter tag.

Only entries that follow all rules will be considered. There will be two grand prize winners for each contest theme: one chosen by public poll, and one chosen by osu! staff. Each winner will get a one-year osu! supporter tag and an osu! tablet.

If anything needs clarifying, let us know. Otherwise, post away!
