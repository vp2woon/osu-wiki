Hello again! Welcome to the third Official osu! Fanart Contest! We've moved away from the monthly schedule to allow each contest a bit more room to breathe, but the idea is largely the same. Each contest will have a unique theme to keep things fresh. This one's theme?

**Stickers! So Many Stickers!**

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2014-07-30-official-osu-fanart-contest-3-begins/fc30-stickers.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/230225)

We're using the word "stickers" to give a sense of shape and size, but we're talking digital stickers here, like the ones used on Facebook or Line or other interesting chat programs as large emoticons. Although, if we get enough usable (high resolution or vector, low color count) artwork, we could actually print physical sticker books. Which would be awesome. But the main goal is to have emoticon-like stickers for use in chat and forums, so design for that primarily. Strong, fun emotions, with simple colors, and transparent backgrounds. Once again a **[full one year supporter tag](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/support)** is up for grabs, and we're offering the added incentive of the **[osu! tablet](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/169139)**, which should come in handy for drawing as well as playing. In addition to the grand prize winners, any sticker that gets used in any official format will win the artist a one-month supporter tag.

Some Rules:

- Artwork must fit theme. In this case, it must be an **emoticon-like sticker**.
- Everything in your image must be **your own work**! Don't steal anyone's art, and please don't "trace" anything either. Make your own pose.
- Don't include any copyrighted characters from outside of osu! Including your own original characters alongside osu! characters is fine. Also, I know I only used Pippi examples in the banner, but I hope to see Yuzu and perhaps Pippidon represented this time around.
- Images must be G-rated and safe-for-work.
- Images must meet the size requirements and have a transparent background.
- Deadline for entries is **August 30th, 2014**.

## How to enter

You must post a web-friendly (370px wide by 320px maximum) image in **[the official contest thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/230225)**, and link to a much larger print-friendly image (at least **1200x1200**, preferably higher, or vector, if possible) for possible merch use. You can upload the images on [https://up.ppy.sh/](https://up.ppy.sh) or [https://puush.me/](https://puush.me) You may enter more than one image, but you can only win one grand prize, and you MUST include all of your entries in one forum post.

By entering, you agree to let us use your art on the osu! website, social media accounts, and merchandise. We'll hopefully be using many of these entries in various web formats, and if we use your art in an official capacity you'll get a one-month supporter tag.

Only entries that follow all rules will be considered. There will be two grand prize winners for each contest theme: one chosen by public poll, and one chosen by osu! staff. Each winner will get a one-year osu! supporter tag and an osu! tablet.

Let me know if anything needs clarifying, otherwise, post away!

*Special thanks to awp, Cataku, beat_freak, sanilecious, and Vikktor, whose artwork I used in creating this contest banner.
