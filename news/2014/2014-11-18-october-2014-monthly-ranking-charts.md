With a slight delay due to the osu! World Cup 2014, the Ranking Charts for October 2014 have just been released and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1410)! Along with that, we updated the [Ranking Charts long-term leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rgaKVJj_MDo0PwGrGXbKRVzjE9fhOUb4XZXRsOjTaoQ/edit) with the new results! Moreover, we published the [vote results here!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bQQsvecPxgHJtFTMGWjSj25FcCmhGu82M8jvvNoKOic/edit)

Unfortunately, we had to put the osu!mania Ranking Charts on halt due to issues within the scoring system. We will pick them up again whenever they are resolved. Keep in mind that the autumn season winner will be rewarded with an additional **3 months supporter tag** and the user title **Charts Champion** for 3 months. Moreover, if one of the current title holders wins the autumn season as well, they will be rewarded with an additional **6 months supporter tag** and the user title **Charts Grandmaster** for 3 months. The winner of each individual ranking chart will receive a 1 month supporter tag.

The charts have been created by letting the [CAT](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/21) and the Staff Members vote for the most noteworthy maps of each respective month. They will end on the 15th December 2014.

Congratulations to the winners of the September 2014 Ranking Charts. They get rewarded with a 1 month supporter tag:

- **osu! standard:** [\_index](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/652457)
- **Taiko:** Axton777
- **Catch the Beat:** [Dusk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533210)

Additionally, we reward the highest voted map by providing 1 month supporter tag to the mapper:

- **osu! standard:** [jonathanlfj](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/jonathanlfj) for [Nekomata Master - Far east nightbird (kors k Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/144171) (10 votes)
- **Taiko:** [\[I\]MMoRTal\[S\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2988243) for [ginkiha - Oriens](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/202040) (9 votes)
- **Catch the Beat:** [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598) for [Warak - REANIMATE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/209103) (9 votes)

Good luck with the new charts!
