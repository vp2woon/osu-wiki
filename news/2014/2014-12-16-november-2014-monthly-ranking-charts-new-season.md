The Ranking Charts for November 2014 have just been released and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1411)! Along with that, the Autumn Season of the [Ranking Charts long-term leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rgaKVJj_MDo0PwGrGXbKRVzjE9fhOUb4XZXRsOjTaoQ/edit) concluded and we have our winners! Moreover, we published the [vote results here!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bQQsvecPxgHJtFTMGWjSj25FcCmhGu82M8jvvNoKOic/edit)

First of all, congratulations to the winners of the Ranking Charts Autumn Season. They will be rewarded with an additional **3 months supporter tag** and the user title **Charts Champion** for 3 months. Unfortunately, no one was able to hold the title and receive the **Charts Grandmaster** user title.

- **osu! standard:** [\_index](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/652457) (Score: 54)
- **Taiko:** [Axton777](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3127106)
- **Catch the Beat:** [Dusk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533210) (Score: 70)

Furthermore, we are opening the new Winter Season of the Ranking Charts. The new season winner will be rewarded with an additional **3 months supporter tag** and the user title **Charts Champion** for 3 months. Moreover, if one of the current title holders wins the new season as well, they will be rewarded with an additional **6 months supporter tag** and the user title **Charts Grandmaster** for 3 months. The winner of each individual ranking chart will receive a 1 month supporter tag.

The charts have been created by letting the [CAT](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/21) and the Staff Members vote for the most noteworthy maps of each respective month. They will end on the 15th January 2014\. Unfortunately, the osu!mania Ranking Charts are still on hold until the issues with the scoring are resolved.

Congratulations to the winners of the October 2014 Ranking Charts. They get rewarded with a 1 month supporter tag:

- **osu! standard:** [randomizer89](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/648613)
- **Taiko:** [Nishizumi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2496768)

Additionally, we reward the highest voted map by providing 1 month supporter tag to the mapper:
