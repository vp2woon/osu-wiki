After a brief hiatus, I am proud to announce that the bi-weekly storyboard showcase has resumed!

**[YUI - Sea](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/13021)**\
**Map and storyboard by [VanMoNky](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/117865), with elements from [Cyril Scarlet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/108066) & [Larto](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12328)**

Where do I even begin? Although the mapping itself is a bit old-styled, the storyboard is simply incredible, featuring all sorts of subtle details, as well as plenty of gorgeous transitions and effects. There is a bit of "flashing" from sudden transitions, but it is done rarely and tastefully so as to not detract from the map itself. The skin choice is very well thought-out too, providing translucent hitcircles so the player can get a better look at the background ;)

Enjoy!
