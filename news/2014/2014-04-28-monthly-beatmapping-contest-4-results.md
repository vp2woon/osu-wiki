After a grueling marathon of back-to-back judging, the results are finally here! We have a winner of our largest and best beatmapping contest yet!

[W h i t e](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/685229) drove his mapping talent straight into the judge's hearts - gaining a near-perfect score from one of them - and officially the highest single and combined score ever awarded in any MBC thus far! With a phenomenal cumulative score of 205, W h i t e takes home the grand prize. Congratulations!

Honourable mentions go to [CloudSplash16](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2099102) and [Jenny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/579428), scoring in at 198 and 192 respectively - only a paltry 7 points between first and second place!

The next Monthly Beatmapping Contest will be opening shortly - there have been a few issues in securing rights and organizing other things behind the scenes. Stay on your toes!
