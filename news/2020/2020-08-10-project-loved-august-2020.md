[Perfume - Daijobanai](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/450272#osu) by [Leminine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1856170)\
128 BPM, 3:03 | 6.21★\
*description written by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

Perfume songs always have this atmosphere of good vibes, and those vibes were captured perfectly in this 6-star map by Leminine. The song is 128 BPM and the map is complete with many different alternating and fast jump patterns that take mastery to play perfectly. Overall, this map is 3 minutes of pure, innocent fun. Check it out!

[DJ'TEKINA//SOMETHING - Internet bitch P\*Light Remix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/349513#osu) by [Nerova Riuz GX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1557955)\
175 BPM, 4:22 | 6.01★\
*description written by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

This is a perfect example of a lightly technical map done right. With many different burst and slider rhythms that capture the song's unique quirks, this is a great map to enjoy a full 4 minutes of that technical style at a comfortable 175 BPM. With the map being 6 stars in difficulty, this should be a fun challenge for anyone looking to improve their streaming and technical skills!

*description written by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

PSYQUI is an artist whose songs truly offer something unique to be captured through mapping, and this brilliant technical map by Hishiro Chizuru takes that uniqueness a step further with creative usage of slider shapes, velocity changes, rhythms, and even some 2B patterns. The map features completely custom hitsounds to top it off and provide the ultimate gameplay experience. If this is the sort of style you crave, be sure to add this one to your collections!

*description written by [fartownik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/56917)*

A long-awaited classic finally makes an appearance! Mapped by Yusomi, this 5 minute single-difficulty mapset never even thinks about hitting the brakes in difficulty. No, really, there isn't a single break present in this 8 star, 215 BPM madness, and we are absolutely not complaining. This map will drain you out faster than... a normal map would! Oh, did I mention it's also mapped amazingly well? Well, it is. Accompanied by a gothic-style banger from the newly acquired featured artist Ariabl'eyeS, there aren't many maps that can surpass the level of enjoyment that this map brings to the table.

*description written by [fartownik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/56917)*

Beware, delicious streams in near proximity, approach with utmost caution. *TOXIC VIBRATION* from the French mapper Musty is a great example of a map you simply never get tired of playing. It destroys your fingers, but you just keep coming back for more, one session after another. The 7-star top difficulty focuses mainly on usage of high-BPM spaced streams to test the player's stamina and stream aim. The mid-6-star guest difficulty by SnowNiNo\_ keeps it more balanced between jumps and streams. Overall, this is a simply stunning set that's been eagerly waiting to be played by all of you!

There's a lot more to osu! than just grinding out the latest jump maps, and this map is the perfect example of just what kinds of maps are out there to chill out with and enjoy. That's not to say the map itself isn't challenging, though: this is a 5-star alternating map that features some complex rhythms and cut streams at 140 BPM. The map is made in an extremely clean style that overall leads it to deserve all the attention it's had.

We've seen many absurdly difficult stream and aim maps enter the Loved category over the years, but this popular mapset by None1637 pushes the boundaries of technical flow aim with its two difficulties, one at mid-7-stars and the other at high-8. Both of these maps feature uniquely shaped 185 BPM streams that aim to push the limits of your flow aim abilities. Do you have what it takes to clear this map? There's only one way to find out!

Every once in a while, it's healthy to recount our favorite memories, and that's exactly what this 17-minute marathon by Fridolin sets out to do. It's a full map of a mashup of classic osu! songs that impacted the community throughout 2017. The map itself reaches past 8 stars in difficulty—not for the faint of heart, but an enjoyable challenge filled with memories nonetheless. Having accrued nearly 400 favorites, this is one of the few marathon compilations that should live on to be remembered.

Because we can't get enough of Shallty's mapping style, we bring you one of his most well known works: *HOPE*. This map features high-BPM longstreams and stamina-draining density to challenge experienced players, including a clean structure and well designed patterns. It's engaging and fun to play and achieve good scores on. Due to the popularity this map has in our community, we think this can't wait anymore to get into the Loved section, and hope you enjoy it!

Congratulations to maziari1105 for #1 in the osu!taiko Japanese Beatmap Contest Light Edition #1! maziari1105 has won 1st place 5 times in this contest and is a man of tremendous mapping ability. The map successfully combines 1/3 and 1/4 rhythms of the track to maximize the chaotic atmosphere of the song. You can feel the harmony of "imperfection" and "perfection" made possible by the very elaborate "missing" notes. The grandeur will leave you speechless...

*description written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

You've probably played a DukeDukeDura map in multiplayer before, and if not then you should, because he has one of the most unique mapping styles in the taiko mapping community, and *Half a Pony* is one of the best examples of that. This techy map is truly an experience when you see all the weird snaps and unstable patterning, plus a full longstream section at the ending that gets rid of your stamina with the sudden high intensity, perfectly resembling this chaotic and irregular atmosphere Igorrr creates with his music. Uniqueness and interesting concepts are the reasons why DukeDukeDura needs more recognition and this map should be in the Loved section.

*description written by [Wesley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2407265)*

Kuzino, probably one of the most known mappers from way back in the osu!catch community, going back all the way to 2011, has mapped a bunch of maps with all kinds of different difficulties. This time around going for Loved is *Red Goose*, which I think is probably one of the easier Kuzino maps out there. However, don't get the wrong idea, because the map is very old and comes with a lot of non-meta patterns that you don't normally see. Kuzino maps are generally known to be played with either no mod at all or with Hidden due to how different their maps are from the newer maps. Will you accept the challenge and try to full combo this with HardRock, or for the speedy people out there maybe with DoubleTime even?

Entering the zone of Loved maps for the first time ever is -Luminate! Together with Benita, he was able to put together this "how is this not Ranked?!" mapset of a wonderful ninelie remix. This map is not too quirky, and very welcoming to play for pretty much everybody, having difficulties from a Cup to an Overdose. The mapset does feel properly fleshed out, and meta-esque as an effect of it not being too quirky, which makes for a smooth playing experience, hence why it was also used in the 2018 CWC. Mods can also be applied properly to this mapset, which I believe high-end players would like to attempt on the higher-end difficulties, as these aren't the most extreme in the world. All in all, this is a very nice mapset with great music to support it, go and Aimer your cursor on the link to download it and check it out!

If you are a player that has been around for a really long time, then there is no way you don't know this map. It was picked in nearly every multiplayer match back then and used to be one of the most well known maps in catch. Nowadays, with so many maps around and so much to play, old gems like this map sadly have been forgotten. gabrieru, the creator of this map, quit the game long ago too. But now is the time to bring this map forward again and give some of the older players nostalgic vibes while showing the new guys how mapping used to be and that it can be really enjoyable to play. That being said, this map is what you expect of an old map. It was created before the hyperdash patch in 2013 which means there are some patterns that were not intended to be played that way. But overall, it's still a fun map to this day which should be known by more people.

It's time to welcome another good map from mapper Minato Yukina. *Little Show Magic - TRICKL4SH 400* is a well done technical map for top players and was selected in the CWC 2020 mappool. There are many fun shaking patterns in this map and they fit the song really well, which also makes the map a pretty good pick for HardRock. Besides the top diff, the other two difficulties created by Razor Sharp and Kyuare are also of high quality and interesting for play. Good luck with practising the electronic technical patterns with this map!

210 BPM, 1:34 | \[4K\] 4.59★

Opening up for us in the osu!mania Loved corner is a map that is short, sweet, and not-so-simple. Elekton's map for *LOSHAXI* takes an off-the-walls and dynamic song choice from artist Se-U-Ra and encapsulates the song's chaotic nature through masterful use of many technical elements like minijacks and quick bursts. This quality of the chart is constant as well, with the patterns throughout being extremely unpredictable and difficult to hit by the nature of the source material Elekton was working with. The chart is an excellent example of high-quality charting for a song with many erratic and complex sounds, and wonderfully displays Elekton's prowess in that sector. The chart has also gained significant popularity for the satisfying nature of the patterns in respect to the song, and the unhinged fun that is a result. LOSHAXI is certain to be a favorite among both charters and players alike.

122 BPM, 2:24 | \[4K\] 4.17★

*ametsuchi* is, like some other jack-based maps you may have seen, a story of build-up and release. The first half has some light broken handstream, slowly introducing some minor jack elements alongside slowly expressing a buildup of pattern density up until the pre-chorus break. After this is a pure bombardment of dense jack patterns at 122 BPM (or higher if you play it on rates). The song supports the repetitive nature of the patterning and serves to create a satisfying, fun experience for any players who wish to lay back with a chill song and smash some jack patterns.

175 BPM, 2:34 | \[4K\] 3.97★

A staple intermediate LN map, *Shotgun Senorita*'s a great challenge for budding long note enthusiasts. While the rhythms may be relatively simple to grasp, the difficulty lies more in the timing of the releases, which can easily trip you up if you're not attentive or consistent. This chart serves as a solid foundation for those who'd like to brush up on their LN timing skills, and as a fodder accuracy map for those who'd like to show off their consistency and control over the craft of noodles.

170 BPM, 2:54 | \[4K\] 4.49★

It's an anime Gekido- map, what more could you ask for? Accompanied with lively and fast-paced music, *More One Night* is filled with varying fun patterns (par for the course for Gekido- maps), such as dumpstreams, jacks, and one-handed and two-handed trills. The patterns fit together very smoothly, and with its attention to musical detail the map is able to allow the players to feel the music through another medium, the intensity of the patterns being almost in parallel with the flow of the music. This map is simply a very enjoyable experience overall, so it's no surprise that it's gotten so popular since its use in SOFT4. The mapset also includes higher rates, which lends itself for players at higher levels to have just as much of a challenge while still having a good time vibing with dabbing anime girls. As such, we welcome this familiar face back into the Loved voting with *More One Night*. \\o7 DAB

Our first 7K pick this round is a collaboration involving a crowd favorite, ruka, and quicalid4 with some additional help from sankansuki. By now, you know what to expect: O2-style 150 BPM chordstreaming mixed in with a couple of flams and minijacks provides a really strong emphasis on mechanics and visuals. The sections and patterning transition very smoothly into each other while providing a heavy amount of variance for the chart. Check out this banger of a song and map to see for yourself!

210 BPM, 2:05 | \[7K\] 5.90★, \[7K\] 7.69★

This next 7K pick has seen some play from last year's 7K osu!mania World Cup 2019 Semifinals. The lower diff, Lv.42, focuses on using 105 BPM full LN chordstreaming while also presenting a few jacks and dense chordjacks. The higher diff, Kim_GodSSI's Lv.72, takes these elements to a much higher level. This diff makes heavy use of chordstream inversions, shields, and hybrid chordjacking sections, which puts the player's finger independence to the test. This is something worth revisiting for both top-level and mid-level noodle slurpers!
