The slammin', sometimes saccharine tunes of **BLOOD CODE** are the latest addition to our Featured Artist line-up!

Making waves across the world with his expansive electronic sound, **BLOOD CODE** is an acclaimed electronic producer with a penchant for punchy tracks with a surprisingly kawaii twist. Don't let the softness fool you though - he's got more musical chops than you'd expect, drawing the notice of big name blogs and labels like *Nest HQ*, *Attack The Music* and more. He's also performed at various anime and video game conventions worldwide, such as *Anime Expo* and *PAX Prime*.

We've managed to snag a collection of **12** tracks from his body of work for you all to experiment with, and we've even got some intrepid minds from the Mappers' Guild starting things off with a brand new showcase set.

Check out a sample of what's new below:
