With a hearty congratulations to our Mapping Olympians in each of osu!'s four game modes, we set our sights on the future, and the time is once again ripe for fruit arrangers from all corners of the globe to take centre stage.

Naturally, fantastic prizes such as the highly coveted *Elite Mapper* title and the glorious *Mapping Olympian* profile badge are on the line. Whether you're taking your first steps into the editor, or a veteran seeking an exciting new challenge, all are encouraged to try their hand in pursuit of mapping glory!

So without further ado, let's meet your new favourite song!

## Song Selection

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, comes courtesy of one of our newest, fantastically-talented Featured Artists, [**MYLK**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/62) and her headlining track, *Waffle Wave*!

MYLK's *Waffle Wave* masterfully blends electronic dance rhythms and sugar-sweet pop vocals to create a truly unique experience that is both accessible to newer mappers, but also presents a vast amount of nuanced poitential for the more experienced.

## Rules

- This contest is for the **osu!catch** mode only.
- Each entry must follow the **[Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)** (with one notable exception, stated below). Entries found to break the Ranking Criteria will be subject to penalties, ranging from point deductions to disqualification based on severity.
- Beatmap submissions must **not** exceed 15MB.
- Storyboards will **not** be considered in the judging process.
- Custom hitsounds **may** be used.
- Collaboration on entries is **not** permitted.
- Maps submitted to the contest must **not** be uploaded using the Beatmap Submission System (BSS) until the contest is concluded and the winners are announced.

As an additional twist for this contest, we'll be asking our contestants to submit **two difficulties** for audiences of different skill levels. One difficulty **must** be an Insane (Rain) or Expert (Overdose) difficulty, and **the other** must be an Easy (Cup), Normal (Salad) or Hard (Platter) difficulty. Each submission must clearly reflect the intended level of difficulty (so no custom difficulty naming please!)

If multiple difficulties from the same category (e.g. Insane and Expert) are submitted, *only the hardest difficulty will be judged*. However, the two difficulties are **exempt from spread requirements**—Normal -> Expert combos and more are certainly welcome here!

## Judging Criteria

For each eligible submitted difficulty, the judging panel will award points based on the following criteria:
- **Musical Relevance (10 pts)**: How well the entry follows the outline of the song through rhythm choices, emphasis, and patterning.
- **Creativity (10 pts)**: How unique and interesting the concepts and themes utilised are.
- **Technique (10 pts)**: How well executed the ideas presented in the entry are.
- **Impression (5 pts)**: The judge's overall impression. How they view the effectiveness of the entry in its entirety.
- **Hitsounding (5 pts)**: How well the entry utilizes hitsounds to add to overall beatmap expression.

## Prizes

After all valid entries are judged and the results are finalized, the top three entrants will receive the following prizes:
- **1st place**: 4 months of osu!supporter, 6 Olympiad Points (awards *Mapping Olympian* Badge), *Elite Mapper* title
- **2nd place**: 3 months of osu!supporter, 4 Olympiad Points
- **3rd place**: 2 months of osu!supporter, 2 Olympiad Points

Olympiad contests utilise a points-based system to award the *Mapping Olympian* badge. Even if you do not win a particular contest, achieving a podium placement in multiple contests can result in the award of a badge. Every 6 points earned will grant a badge level, with incrementation on the badge for each level achieved.
