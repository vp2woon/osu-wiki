We're proud to welcome **BLANKFIELD** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/80/header.jpg)

Renowned among Japanese doujinshi music circles for his masterful guitar arrangements of popular video game tracks, the one-man circle [**BLANKFIELD**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/80) has been rocking heads since 2007 straight out of Comiket and beyond.

**31** new tracks across his discography are now available for your mapping enterprises, featuring arrangements of classic Touhou Project themes in a style that mixes metal and electronica like the two were made for each other.

Don't take my word for it, check out a few previews below, plus two showcase maps by some of the Mappers' Guild's most talented creators:

You can find all the tracks listed above plus a whole bunch more over at [**BLANKFIELD**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/80), all pre-timed and perfectly ready for you to map. No additional fiery rage required, just unpack and start making awesome things.

Half the planet seemed to guess this week's hint, though it wasn't a particularly hard one this time around, so everybody who correctly managed it is free to give themselves a pat on the back. You're a winner, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Unless you're @Duskyui (who went too galactic and ended up with toby fox) or @thenerdkid351 (who guessed... jhlee0133), in which case... better luck next week.

New week, new artist, you know how the deal goes. The [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) will be primed sometime during the week with another hint and likely other news and cool stuff to keep you in the know, so make sure to check it out.
