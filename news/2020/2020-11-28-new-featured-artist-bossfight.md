**Bossfight** invades his way to our Featured Artist roster!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/119/header.jpg)

Hosting a distinctly recognizable bass-filled and upbeat sound, [**Bossfight**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/119) is a Swedish producer renowned throughout both EDM and gaming circles. He's clearly mastered his craft, as seen by his appearances in *Rocket League*, *Geometry Dash*, and *Just Shapes & Beats*, plus his numerous *Monstercat* releases throughout the last 3 years.

**13** songs are now available from this monster of a musician encompassing the full range of his 10 year discography, including the already ranked hit *Sonder*.

Traverse the white light and give these samples a listen:

Everything above and a bunch more can be scouted over at [**Bossfight**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/119). Songs are all pre-timed of course, so your mapping skill is all you need to truly prove yourself.

Quick sidenote: all you stat nerds might also be happy to hear that we recently surpassed **3000 total Featured Artist tracks!** It's insane to think about honestly, especially considering we had reached 2000 earlier this year.

And we've still got more to come! Keep an eye on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for all the updates you could ever ask for and we'll see you next Wednesday for another Featured Artist!

'til then!
