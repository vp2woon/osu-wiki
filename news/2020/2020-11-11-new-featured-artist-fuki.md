We're proud to welcome **Fuki** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

If you're a fan of Japanese metal or rock, you might already know **Fuki** from her time as a vocalist in bands like *LIGHT BRINGER*, *Unlucky Morpheus* and *DOLL$BOXX*. She's participated in a wide range of projects, ranging from things like radio voice-overs, voice acting, narration. She has also sung the ending themes of anime like *Kaitou Joker*, *W'z* and even the theme song for *IKEMEN REVOLUTION - Love & Magic in Wonderland*.

**11** new tracks from her are now available straight from her album titled *Million Scarlets*, including a track featured in the osu! World Cup 2019 Finals week, and two brand new showcase sets from some of the minds of the Mappers' Guild.

Check out a preview of what's available below:
