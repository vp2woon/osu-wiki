**The underdog Team Argentina makes it second among the sea of big teams!**

Team Argentina took the most surprising route in this championship, eventually managing to eliminate 3 big countries in a row!

Their journey started on the ninth place of the Qualifiers leaderboards, immediately matching them with Team China in Round of 16. Surprisingly, the outcome of the match was pretty close for Team Argentina, who scraped past Team China with a score of 3-2!

They wanted to show the world that this win against Team China wasn't just a bit of luck, so they performed excellently against the big teams of Team France and Team Brazil, by eliminating them with a 6-1 score, twice in a row!

Unfortunately, their journey came to an end against Team United Kingdom in the Grand Finals by a narrow 3-4 loss, giving the intrepid UK their first close call of the competition in the process.

**Team Brazil takes the bronze medal back home!**

After a sudden retirement in 2019, Team Brazil came back in the race with a brand new line-up!

Slow and steady winning the race. This strategy led Brazil to many victories. They started the contest in twelfth place during the Qualifiers, matching them with a fifth place Team Sweden for the Round of 16. They ultimately came out on top with a 3-2 victory, and advanced further on into the tournament.

They valiantly fought for the third place in Finals against Team Russia with a 4-3 score after weaving through a wide array of extremely talented teams in the process - no small feat indeed!

**Team Russia narrowly misses a top three finish!**

Despite being fourth overall, Team Russia put in enormous amounts of work every step along the way, fighting tooth and nail for a bronze podium finish that they just barely fell short of. We expect great things from them in the future!
