2019 has come and gone, and with it, an entire year of mapping legacy enters the history books forever more. Become a part of history and help us decide which of 2019's maps were the Community Choice!

In case you're unfamiliar, every year we run a mass poll including all Ranked maps submitted across a calendar year to help determine which maps were the most adored by the community at large. This has gone by a variety of names, from the venerable "Best Of 20XX" series back in the earlier days of the game's history, to the more recent "Community Choice" series.

Each and every player gets **10 votes per game mode** to cast for **any Ranked map from 2019 which they have played at least once**. You don't have to worry about figuring all this out — the power of our contest system will auto-magically handle this for you, and present you with a list of all the entries you're eligible to vote for.

Voting is super simple: just pick through your list for the maps that wowed you the most, and give them a star with a click.

The highest voted maps from each mode will be branded as the Community Favourites of 2019, and net their authors a **shiny new profile badge**, plus **6 months of osu!supporter**. The other maps in the top 10 will all see their authors receive **3 months of osu!supporter** to honour their efforts.

Got all that? When you're ready to vote, head to the following links:

The polls will remain open until the **7th of February, 2020**, which is exactly **15 days** from the date of this post. Get in and get your votes done quick, you'll be surprised how fast it passes by.
