We're proud to welcome **Rohi** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

Another blast from the past, [**Rohi**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/82) is a Japanese producer most renowned for his Vocaloid works on *Nico Nico Douga*. Tracks like  *Kakuzetsu Thanatos* and *Kodoku Egoism* were all the rage back in the 2013 days of osu!, with groundbreaking mappers like [NatsumeRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/151679) taking his sound and using it to lay a foundation of creative work that would influence hundreds of creators going forward.

We've managed to snag **9** historic tracks from **Rohi**'s discography, finally bringing many of these classic maps into the loving embrace of licensed content.

There's still plenty more of **Rohi**'s sound left to discover though, so make sure to give these a listen:

All of this plus a bunch more are available right now over at [**Rohi**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/82), so if any of this stuff interests you, check out his profile and take a stab at mapping some! Everything is pre-timed and ready to go, so what're you waiting for?

Tweeters @drewdeowo, @FKnea, @ImMyyrh and @stacker_joe all nabbed this week's hint in classic big-brain style. This week's one was a combination of translating 'kakuzetsu' into isolation, and 'thanatos' into death, and bringing it all back together. Nice! All Beatmap Nominators reading this post are contractually obligated to nod approvingly.

In a departure from the normal, we'll be hosting a second Featured Artist updates release sometime this week featuring a huge assortment of tracks from some of the ultra talent in our catalogue. We're committed to keeping up with the pace of our artists where we can, and bringing you as much sick new music as humanly possible, if that wasn't already obvious!

Keep your eyes peeled on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for more details throughout the week, and until then, enjoy!
