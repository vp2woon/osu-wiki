We're proud to welcome **O2i3** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/74/header.jpg)

Jumping into our ears back during 2015 with *Ooi*, **O2i3** is a Korean producer with a penchant for energetic and engaging tracks drawing from a variety of electronic music genres for inspiration.

We've managed to snag **8** tracks of his, including classics like *TSLove* and a few others that we'll think you'll love.

Check it all out:

All of the above plus a few more are available right now over at [**O2i3**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/74), all pre-timed and awaiting your creative touch. Maybe you're the next Fort in the making, give it a try!

The hint tweet arrived fashionably late this week, but that didn't stop tweeters @Kaeldori, @Daykeyboard, @Qauland and @idealismosu (plus others who arrived similarly late) from guessing correctly. Good job!

I think everybody knows by now what's on the cards for next week's release, but in case you don't, check in with the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) throughout for hints, tidbits and other stuff you'll probably like. See you then!
