**Task Horizon** joins the lineup as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/97/header.jpg)

A four-man drum & bass project from Switzerland, **Task Horizon** is renowned across the scene for their gritty, pounding tracks and distinctive sound. Supported by A-list DJ acts like *Noisia*, *Friction* and *Andy C*, **Task Horizon** has very much made a name for themselves in recent years, and we're excited to bring their work to osu! as well.

We've got a whopping **40** tracks for everyone to sink their teeth into, with the osu!taiko wing of the Mappers' Guild already well ahead of the curve with a few brand new showcase maps to get things rolling.

Check out a preview of a few tracks below:

All of the above plus a whole host more (35, in fact!) are available right this very moment over at [**Task Horizon**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/97) pre-timed and just waiting for you to make them into the next big thing.

This week's hint came on short notice due to a few scheduling changes on our end (you'll find out why if you keep reading), but astute tweeters @Kazegaaa, @Trint001 and @Emree1504 all nailed the hint with their answers in full. Well done! They win precisely nothing except your undying adulation. Praise them in the comments... or else.

Remember a couple of months ago how we spoke about a forthcoming giant update release, and then said nothing about it for weeks and weeks? Good news, everyone! We've finally wrangled the licensing details for said release and are happy to announce that this upcoming Friday is going to be the date that it all happens. We won't be spoiling who's getting what exactly, but we can say that it covers *8* of our extraordinarily talented Featured Artists.

Keep an eye on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for more details as they arise, and until then, enjoy experiencing everything **Task Horizon** has got to offer. Which is a lot, in case you didn't notice.
