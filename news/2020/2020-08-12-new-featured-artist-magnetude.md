**Magnetude** joins the lineup as our latest Featured Artist!

The two-man talents of Rustam Mansurov and James Peacock, **Magnetude** is an electronic producer duo most well known for their high energy, atmospheric and sometimes operatic tracks.

We're proud to welcome them aboard with a choice selection of **17** drum and bass inspired pieces, all hand picked for maximum oomph.

Don't be left wondering what all the hype's about - see for yourself with the previews below:

All of the above plus a whole bunch more are available right this very moment from [**Magnetude**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/94) pre-timed and ready to rumble, so what are you waiting for?

This week proved to be another victory for the Hintern, with none of our resident Tweeters managing to suss out the hint. "off the scale" was a clever play on *magnitude*, which you might be most familiar with from the Richter scale. We felt this was very fitting because seismic bass eruptions are indeed a natural response to blasting any one of **Magnetude**'s tracks.

That's all for this time, but make sure to keep tabs on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) for more news, hints and other official tidbits that you probably want to know. We'll be back the same time next week (as usual) with another stonking artist for you to get excited over!
