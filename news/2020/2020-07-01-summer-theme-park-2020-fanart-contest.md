Summer is finally here, and we're all thoroughly sick of being cooped up inside, so what better way to live vicariously than through our adorable mascots enjoying some time at a summery amusement park?

Let me ask you a little question, do you like to draw?

If you do, put pen to paper (or tablet) and try **drawing any of our official osu! mascots or community mascots enjoying any attractions of your choice from an amusement park/theme park for the chance to get your work featured as our Summer seasonal backgrounds, and appear in-game!**

We've decided 2020 is the year of themes judging from how spectacularly well our [Spring Indoors fanart contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-04-24-spring-indoors-2020-fanart-contest-results) went down, so we're keeping the spirit alive by tasking our intrepid artists to have a go at drawing our mascots enjoying the majesty that is the modern amusement park.

What's an amusement park, you might ask? Roller-coaster rides, cotton candy stalls, festival games, majestic aquatic animal performances, ferris wheels, slingshot towers, bumper cars, standing in line for half of your mortal lifespan, basically anything that happens in some kind of theme park is fair game.

You've got **14 days** from the date of this post to make your creation happen and to submit it via our [automagical contest submission system](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/107). If it follows our rules (which you're about to read below, RIGHT?!) it'll go up for voting at the end of the submission period for everybody to vote on.

A top selection of the entries voted for by YOU will be made into Summer seasonal background pieces and will feature on the main-menu for several weeks, as well as snagging their authors some free osu!supporter and a new profile badge commemorating their victory if they score high enough.

Sound good? Of course it does. Read the rules below before entering though, or BAD things will happen:

## Rules

- **All entries MUST be themed around Summer Theme Parks and feature at least one (or more) of the osu! mascots (either official or community).** The theme is theme parks (or amusement parks, whatever's your jam). As long as it has something vaguely theme-park related in it and features one of our mascots, you'll be fine.
- **All entries MUST be suitable for all-ages viewing.** No smut or anything overly suggestive, please. Think of the children!
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK. REDRAWING AND COMPOSITE WORKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** Don't plagiarize. Redrawing is defined as tracing over someone else's work and modifying features. Composite works are defined as any work that uses elements from someone else's creation. Brushes and other common uses for such things are fine.
- **ATTRIBUTION (artist names, Twitter handles, etc) must be limited to NO MORE THAN THREE LINES TOTAL and confined to either the bottom left or bottom right corners of your piece.** We want you to be proud of your work, but please remember that any winning pieces will be on the main menu for a long period of time, and osu! is very squeamish about advertising anything as a whole.
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece - namely 2732x1536. THIS IS CHECKED BY A SCRIPT AND ENTRIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE DISCARDED AUTOMATICALLY.** This is the #1 reason for entries not making it to voting phase. MAKE SURE YOUR ENTRY MEETS THE EXACT RESOLUTION REQUIREMENTS ABOVE. Check it after you've exported it, seriously, this one catches so many people out.
- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed on the main menu and during the voting process.** Please consult previous entries in the series to understand what we mean here. In smaller words, big osu! cookie takes up most of the screen. Design your piece accordingly.
- **DO NOT LEAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR SUBMISSION!**
- **DO NOT LEAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR SUBMISSION!**
- **DO NOT LEAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR SUBMISSION!**
- **Don't use copyrighted characters from other intellectual properties.** You can freely use any of the osu! mascots (pippi, Yuzu, Mocha, Maria) and any of the community mascots (Tama, Aiko, Taikonator, any of the submissions from the Most Manic Art contest also apply), but avoid using direct representations of characters from other worlds or franchises in your work. Remember that the community mascots are also someone else's creation, so make sure to treat their work with the same respect that you'd treat yours.

Once you've drummed all that into your brain (consult your local osu!taiko player for help with this if you find it difficult), head over to the [Summer Theme Park 2020 Fanart Contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/107) and submit your entry.

Good luck!
