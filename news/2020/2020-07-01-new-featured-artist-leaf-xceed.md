We're proud to welcome **LEAF XCEED Music Division** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

A blast from the past coming straight at you in 2020, [**LEAF XCEED Music Division**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/88) is here to stay as our newest addition to the Featured Artist roster.

Most well known in osu! from his tracks *Fur Elisa* ([mapped](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/23916) by [Louis Cyphre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/186243)), *YuYu Metal* ([mapped](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/45528) by [DoKito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/537084)), and more recently *Guitar vs Piano* ([mapped](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/518003) by [Shiro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/113005)), we're excited to announce a new ensemble of 8 tracks including most of these timeless classics is now available, all bundled up in a neat album rather aptly titled *osu! 「SELECT」*.

In addition, the Mappers' Guild has been hard at work creating new takes on these classic metal hits to quite literally, bring your experience into the modern era. Don't discount the older tracks though - they're every bit as good now as they were back in 2011!

Check out a few previews below for yourself and see what all the hype is about:

All of the above plus a few more are available for your mapping adventures over at [**LEAF XCEED Music Division**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/88), all pre-timed and ready to go. Will your creation be the next big thing to leave a mark on osu!'s creative history? Only one way to find out, and that's by sitting down and mapping the stuff.

The hint game this week sure was something, though this time, the machinations of the Hintern claim victory for the first time... well, ever. The first hint released on Monday confounded dozens of guessers, though it did need a little bit of music general knowledge to boot. The phrase "album leaf number 50275" referred chiefly to "Bagatelle no. 25" more commonly known as "Für Elise". That particular track can be also be referred to as an *Albumblatt*, which translates to 'album leaf', and 50275 refers to multiplying 2011 (the date of Louis Cypher's ranked map of *Fur Elisa*) by 25.

This marks the first time that we've ever had to whip out the backup hint (which was considerably easier) and tweeter @fiery\_\_\_ was the first to get it, followed by @xMedi3. We're not wholly sure fieryrage entirely counts here, given that he was also one of the people involved in mapping the new sets for this artist release (hmm), but we'll smile and nod just this once.

That's all for this week, but we'll be back again next week with another new artist for you, and hopefully those updates we promised nearly a month ago at this point. Stay tuned to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) for more details!
