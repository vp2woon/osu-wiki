[Tipper - Dreamsters](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/914372#osu) by [Drimm](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4488808)\
92 BPM, 5:21 | 6.32★

Have you ever listened to music and just closed your eyes, letting the tranquility take over your imagination and making you feel as if you're... drifting upwards? It's a nice feeling, but we can't sit there forever! After all, we have more important things we could be getting to in life, such as playing osu!. Ah, if only there was a way we could replicate that beautiful feeling and play osu! at the same time... wouldn't it be awesome if there was a map like that?

Well, thanks to the genius mapping mind of Drimm, those wishes are a thing of the past. Seriously. This map's unique gimmick of splitting the map into five distinct layers takes "perfect execution" to a whole nother level—no, a whole nother plane of existence. Combined with a circle size of 9, this is easily one of the most beautifully crafted maps you will ever lay your eyes on.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-05-16-project-loved-may-2020/osu/2-still-in-my-heart-feat-punipuni-denki.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1070632)

[PSYQUI - Still in my heart feat. Punipuni Denki](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/961460#osu) by [Typ4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6902361) et al.\
172 BPM, 3:31 | 4.85★ – 6.50★

PSYQUI is an artist that has been steadily building a name within the osu! community, and with that comes tons of unique, high quality maps of their songs. This mapset hosted by Typ4 features a wide array of difficulties by various mappers that range between four and six stars. Each difficulty has a slightly different gimmick to it, using the song's potential in unique ways, so be sure to give each one a try!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-05-16-project-loved-may-2020/osu/3-osu-stream-compilation-201x.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1070631)

[Various Artists - osu! Stream Compilation 201X](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/983336#osu) by [wakaba](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4657414)\
200 BPM, 15:16 | 7.85★

This is a compilation map that takes us back through memory lane, showcasing the most popular streamy songs that have been around in the last decade of osu!. The compilation is split into three sections, labeled Farm Maps, Onslaught, and Endurance. The BPM of each song increases gradually within each section.

To put it simply, this is fifteen minutes of high-quality stream mapping. Give it your all.

[wac - neu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/45031#osu) by [Nakagawa-Kanon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/87065)\
190 BPM, 11:35 | 6.26★

Sure, osu! is a rhythm game and all, but how many maps are there where you're really playing for the music? This is a completed map from 2012 of the full 11-minute version of *neu*, a song that is well known within the osu! community. The song features intense streamy sections separated by long calm sections, and the middle of the song quickly shuffles through many other songs from Pop'n Music, the source game of this song. If you're here for the music, this map is surely here to help you stay.

[the peggies - Neverland](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/776015#osu) by [Meg](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1872496)\
184 BPM, 3:19 | 6.51★

This comfy jump map by Meg sits at 184 BPM and has gathered over 120 favorites since it was submitted in 2018. The spacing increases gradually throughout the map's 3-minute duration, building up to a difficulty that brings the map to mid 6-stars. This is a great map to play to either practice or have fun with a nice jump map!

[positive MAD-crew - Lapistoria no Yakusoku (Rigid Blue Remains)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/549158#osu) by [rollpan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3062998)\
186 BPM, 3:20 | 6.36★

Shirasaka Koume is known for having a very clean and enjoyable mapping style, and it's reflected perfectly in this 3-minute map that features lots of bursts and streams at a consistent, 186 BPM rhythm. While the map itself is in the 6-star range, the mapping style and song combined are able to make the map feel very relaxing. See for yourself!

154 BPM, 4:29 | 6.56★, 6.90★

You can't go wrong with Eurobeat music when it comes to getting hyped up, and you can't go wrong with Woey maps when it comes to having a great time. What happens when you put the two together? That's right: *GAS GAS GAS*. Four and a half minutes of 154 BPM alternating patterns and an absolute banger of a song. Step on it!

[Camellia - shadows of cats](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/464366#osu) by [Arbane](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4150829)\
174 BPM, 4:15 | 6.01★

It's hard to find a map that executes stream tech well, but *shadows of cats* by Arbane completely nails the execution. It's a 174 BPM Camellia song that features split streams that play exactly how you would want them to. The rhythm features a mix of various length streams, which makes this map great for both testing and training your finger control. Be sure to check this one out!

*description written by [jyake](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9099822)*

Get your tech game going! This month we have yet another great 1/6 map by 7_7. This map starts with a moderate tempo, filled with a wide variety of rhythms ranging from 1/4 mixed with 1/6 to ending in 1/3 patterns. But it doesn't stop there. Just as you thought you got through an already pretty tight section, oh you're in for a treat. It's time for a speedup! Are you ready to take on extra-speedy 1/6 rhythms? Well even if you aren't you should play this anyway! It's really fun, so why miss out?

110 BPM, 2:01 | 7.22★\
*description written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

ll-oscar is probably one of the most experienced high-BPM mappers, with jewels like *Scarlet Rose*, *iLLness LiLin* or *Towa Naru Kizuna to Omoi no Kiseki*, he has been mapping these kinds of difficulties for years now. This time we're bringing shio's *Qronostasis*, which reaches a whopping 350 BPM filled with very thoughtful and flow-oriented patterning and so being quite satisfying to play (if you can handle the BPM, that is).

As one of the most hype maps to watch back in TWC 2019 (with KyouRekii87 doing an insane performance both times he had to play it and an FC barely escaping his grasp), we decided this one would be the perfect map to bring to this cycle. Good luck!

*description written by [Yumeno Himiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1806962)*

Are you a fan of old maps? As one of the ancient osu!catch mappers, MountainBrother tried to make this map as if hyperdashes didn't exist, like the maps before the end of 2009. Although the jumps are already playable and not rare to see in regular catch maps, *Raijin no Hidariude* is still one of the most fun maps with cool hyperless jumps and asks for your precise controls. With approach rate 8, this is definitely a good map for Hidden practice. Try your best to catch all the fruits and prove yourself with this dash challenge!

263 BPM, 2:13 | 6.33★\
*description written by [Wesley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2407265)*

We're back again with a map from Vincs, a French cover of the well-known song *Despacito*. The map was created as a warmup for the osu!catch World Cup 2018 for the French team. The map was used quite a bit in multiplayer lobbies back around the year and hasn't seen much sunlight lately. The song starts out slow, but it quickly builds up so that you have to move left and right all over the place, getting close to no breaks to slow down at all. In order to enjoy the full experience, make sure to turn on the hitsounds and enjoy the beauty Vincs has created.

*description written by [Sartan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4100941)*

Coming in with the most fire song of this osu!catch round of Loved (hihi haha) we have another entry from our dear veteran mapper Spectator. This set features only two difficulties, but with the song being 3:22 long, there is still quite a lot to be seen. In this set we have a surprisingly nicely mapped rain by Ollapeu, somebody that has not yet been featured in Loved.

There are not really many weird gimmicks to be found in this set as it is very purely mapped, but that does not mean it can't pose a challenge even to the better players in our community when combined with mods such as HardRock or even DoubleTime on either of these difficulties. So go fire up your game (I did it again! Hihihi hahaha) and check it out!

*description written by [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)*

119410501 is known as a very skilled player in the catch community, yet his maps are not known nowadays and haven't been receiving much attention, which I think is a shame, because he made some fun maps that certainly do deserve more attention than they get. One of those maps is *COME BACK HOME*.

A very hard map with unorthodox patterns bordering on the impossible, it is easy to miss an entire pattern and die because of the drain, let alone getting a pass!. But this challenging aspect is what makes the map so fun and increases its replay value. If you are looking for a challenge that might take you a while, then make sure to give this map a try!

[Dev/Null - Zombie Sunset](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/905658#mania) by [Vortex-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4999669)\
301 BPM, 3:43 | \[4K\] 6.26★, \[4K\] 5.14★, \[4K\] 5.52★, \[4K\] 5.91★, \[4K\] 4.71★

Dev/Null is an artist that has been in the VSRG circles for over a decade now, but only for a couple of years in the Loved circle of osu!mania. The next submission to be given that honor is coming up right now, with Vortex-'s chart for *Zombie Sunset*.

Just like almost any other Dev/Null song out there, the breakcore music is very complicated, something that Vortex- has capitalised greatly on, allowing for a structure that takes advantage of recurring sounds to make it consistent, but also keeping it varied throughout by utilizing the complicated structure brought forth by him.

Things that come to mind when appreciating Vortex-'s map are the intricate LNs and flams used for specific sounds, but also the focus on columns equating to other sounds and the repeating percussion. This all culminates in a wonderful and exciting entry very fit for the Loved section.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-05-16-project-loved-may-2020/mania/2-wallspin.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1070615)

175 BPM, 3:14 | \[4K\] 5.08★, \[4K\] 5.50★, \[4K\] 5.95★

A familiar face in the Loved section, Pope Gadget returns with *Wallspin*. It's not often that you see this kind of music in osu!mania, and it is even less likely to encounter a mashup of two well-known songs. A community favorite of the osu!mania 4K World Cup 2018, *Wallspin* is a name that any tournament regular or competitive speed player in recent years should be able to recognize.

Reaching a whopping 340.7 BPM in the chorus sections, with 511 BPM rolly bursts scattered throughout the map, playing this map is no easy task. It's a great challenge for many speed players, which only added to its popularity following its use in MWC. Given its community recognition and popularity, *Wallspin* most definitely deserves its spot in the Loved section. Anyway, here's Wonderwall.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-05-16-project-loved-may-2020/mania/3-berry-go.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1070614)

175 BPM, 1:54 | \[4K\] 4.51★

Over the years, PiraTom has been revered as one of Japan's great LN mappers, a very well-deserved title. *Berry Go!!* is demonstrative of this: it is a well-designed, fun long-note map, serving as a perfect introduction to LN maps at the intermediate level. *Berry Go!!* is generally well-known in tournament circles, and is a very popular and recognizable map in the competitive LN scene.

With its speedy and articulate nature, as seen in many of the bursts and near-inverse patterns, it doesn't come at a surprise that this map is greatly enjoyed by LN players of a wide range of skill—though part of its popularity undoubtedly stems from how catchy the song is. With all of this in mind, this map is most certainly a well-suited candidate for the Loved section. Berry go, go, go!

[GALNERYUS - RAISE MY SWORD](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/661715#mania) by [IcyWorld](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1383951)\
184 BPM, 7:02 | \[4K\] 5.11★

The ever large downtown block cultivated by IcyWorld is one of the biggest and most recognizable of anyone in osu!mania and StepMania, with titles like *Cyber Inductance* and *Sa'eed* rounding out his collection as some of the most popular. That repertoire will only grow larger with the nomination of *Raise My Sword*! In true IcyWorld fashion, it's a 7 minute, stamina shredding marathon with a near constant stream of jumpstream, handstream, and speedy bursts.

The straightforward approach is certainly a beloved one among the community, and it is backed by very exciting music in Galneryus' signature power metal, never showing signs of breaking from the intensity it sets out for, even during the musical breaks. *Raise My Sword* is a clear choice as a nomination for the loved section through its massive popularity and straightforward nature, sure to grab the intrigue of anyone who passes by.

180 BPM, 4:04 | \[7K\] 9.24★

For this wave, we're having two 7K noodle charts back to back! Our first pick comes from a crowd favorite: KenZ!

Taking advantage of playful LN releases mixed with 1/8 streams and LN lengths, this chart takes common O2Jam mapping tropes and combines them into a very challenging and expressive notechart, masterfully making the whole thing work at a whopping 180 BPM. Best of luck to those up for the challenge!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-05-16-project-loved-may-2020/mania/6-sky-of-twilight.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1070611)

[Ito Kanako - Sky of Twilight](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/149527#mania) by [Brainpeeler](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2551306)\
108 BPM, 6:12 | \[7K\] 6.03★

Our second 7K noodle pick for this round is quite a blast from the past. Going back as far as 2014, *Sky of Twilight* is one of the few charts to gain some degree of attention from players during this timeline. The map has some clear markings of age from the shield usages and level of rigidity with the trills, chords, and stream usages which quite mirrors a very early age of O2Jam-style notecharting.

The question to ask is does it stand the test of time?
