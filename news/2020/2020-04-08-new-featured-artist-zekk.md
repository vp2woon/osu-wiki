We're proud to welcome EDM master **Zekk** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/76/header.jpg)

You might already be familiar with **Zekk**'s work from games like *CYTUS II* and the countless radio features and releases he's made to circles like *S2TB Recordings*, *MEGAREX* and *Diverse System*. In case you're not, **Zekk**'s a BEMANI-influenced electronic music producer who's been turning heads since 2013, and we're super stoked to have him on board.

In fact, we know a lot of you are already in the know [thanks to the deluge of various beatmaps made in recent years to his work](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=zekk) across pretty much every game mode and difficulty range. We've managed to snag mostly all of these plus a bunch more in this release, for a total of **35 tracks** now available.

On top of the above, the Mappers' Guild has also been hard at work on a set of new, modern preview maps that we'll be showcasing below, so make sure to check those out!

Without further ado:

As usual, all of the above plus an absolute horde more are available right now over at [**Zekk**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/76), pre-timed and awaiting your creative blessing. This stuff is some serious fire if you like EDM, make sure to give it a listen!

Tweeter @joesuckswow appears to be the sole person to guess this week's release correctly, though the spectrum of guesses was the widest that we think it has ever been. For those interested in what the hint actually was, "STREAMER from another world" refers to [NEKO](https://cytus.fandom.com/wiki/NEKO#.CE.A6.CF.89.CE.A6) from the *Cytus II* universe, in which one of **Zekk**'s tracks, Zealous Hearts is featured. Considering a lot of the guesses were for one of our more popular streamers, [BeasttrollMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691), a lot of people were at least *half* right, though we'll leave you to decide whether that half was the anime girl or streamer portion for yourselves.

This week's been quite something for mapping, but it isn't over yet! A special reveal has been teased for later in the week on the heels of [Project Loved's revival](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-04-07-project-loved-april-2020), so make sure to keep your eyes peeled for more details on that. We'll be back next week with another brand new release, so pay attention to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for hints and tidbits if that's your jam.
