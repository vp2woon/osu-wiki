We're excited to introduce Mani and Mari, our two newest official osu!mascots!

Almost a year ago, we held the [Most Manic Art Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/80) in an effort to have the community create a brand new brother-sister pair of mascots, and wish [Maria](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-04-20-meet-maria-osumanias-new-mascot) well as she moved on to new things.

The contest came and went, and for many months, there was only silence as things brewed behind the scenes. But now, we're pleased to finally introduce to you...

**Mani and Mari.**

Much like Mocha and Yuzu before them, Mani and Mari represent a great joining in osu!'s history where the creators of the game and the community come together to bring things to life.

The product of [**xiemon**'s](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5203667) artistic design and concept direction, Mari and Mani are an exciting new addition to the osu!mascot roster, and we hope that people find their twin-hating antics as amusing and endearing as we did. xiemon really went above and beyond in his characterization of the twins, impressing us from day one with their vibrant personalities.

You might be wondering, wow, Mari sure looks like Maria - weren't we supposed to be saying goodbye to her? In all of xiemon's brilliance, he took the groundwork laid down by Daru and the community across years of fanart contests and breathed new life into the design, bringing her back as Mari. It's only fitting, after all - there's no way she'd ever let her brother hog all of the spotlight!

While we won't be celebrating the twins with their own dedicated fan art contest like we did for Mocha, we will be announcing a *very* popular continuation on our art contests in the next couple of days, and we fully expect to see the twins putting in a fearsome showing there!

We'd like to extend our thanks to everybody who put their own designs forward for the Most Manic Art Contest, and an extra special thank you to xiemon for his patience with us in seeing this through to the end.
