A timeless classic, **ginkiha** arises as our latest addition to the Featured Artist lineup!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/72/header.jpg)

Making waves in osu!'s musical fabric since 2012, **ginkiha** is basically a household name when it comes to rhythm gaming music, easily one of the most beloved artists embraced by our community to date. Today, we're delighted to announce that it is official, and he's here to stay.

You might know him from maps like *EOS*, *Borealis*, *Oriens* and *dawn*, just to name a few. His signature high-speed, uplifting sound is practically perfect for mapping, with that little lick of classic rhythm game arcade sound that brings it all together.

We've got **28** tracks available right now for your perusal, including pretty much all the classics you know and love.

Check out a sample of a few:

Nobody gets a hint call-out this week because it wasn't *just* easy, it was practically a special announcement before the fact! **ginkiha** has been a hugely requested artist for a long time, and we're super excited to have finally made it all official, and in the process, to have paid homage to some of the best creations the game has ever seen.

We've still got several months of artists in wings just ready and waiting to go, courtesy of pishifat's never-ending efforts to sling deals with every artist on the planet. Check back this time next week for another taste, and maybe even visit the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) mid-week for more news and a sneaky hint or two, if that's your deal.
