Are you a mapper? A storyboarder? Or maybe a talented music producer? Show your love for an osu! community favorite in this multi-layered contest!

Everyone knows [**Kuba Oms - My Love**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/163112). Put 100 osu! players in a room and you'd be safe betting that half of them could sing its chorus. The beatmap has nearly 70 *million* plays and is a source of nostalgia for generations of us.

We paired with *Kuba Oms* to set up a contest celebrating this timeless classic — a contest more ambitious than any we've hosted before!

## Teams

Lots to go through. Let's keep it short.

**This is a team-based contest.** Users with different skillsets must collaborate to create a *full beatmap experience*, including:

- Remix of the song **Kuba Oms - My Love** ([download stems here](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/files/115/a_labour_of_love_stems.zip))
- Beatmap spread following the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) (osu! only)
- Storyboard or custom video

**Submit your team name and member list to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjtVsUWIArvf--pKA0RLiCdXuO1_wO2Va2ICjenEcz9ZqI5Q/viewform).** Once confirmed, your team will be documented on the [A Labour of Love contest wiki page](/wiki/Contests/A_Labour_of_Love_Contest). Teams are limited to 5 members.

With teams being public, we'll be taking a different approach from usual contests: **entries will NOT be anonymized.**

In fact, we encourage you to tease your submission as it's being created! Feel free to announce your team publicly and show off your work. We're celebrating an osu! classic and we can't do that very well if everyone keeps their work hidden.

*"I'm a super cool mapper/storyboarder, but I don't know anyone who can remix songs. What do I do?"* There's likely a lot of people in this situation. We recommend anyone looking for teammates to post in the comments saying so. Forming a suitable team is half of the challenge for this contest!

## Schedule

- **3 months:** Contest is open for submissions [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/115) until the end of February 2021. There's a lot of work going into this, so you might need the extra time.
- **2 weeks:** Submissions are judged by separate mapper and musician judging panels.
- **2 weeks:** Community voting is opened for top 5 overall submissions.

Once all of these are completed, the winners will be announced!

## Prizes

No such thing as a contest without prizes! Unlike most contests however, there's a few different ways to earn prizes this time around.

Two groups will handle judging: **mappers (including storyboarders!)** and **musicians**. They'll be expected to evaluate the full package — the remixed song + beatmap + storyboard/video combo.

Each group has its own specialty of course, so we'll be rewarding prizes to the all members of the highest scoring team from each panel.

### Mapper panel

- **Runner-up:** 3 months of osu!supporter
- **Winner:**  6 months of osu!supporter + *Mappers' Pick* profile badge

- **Winner:**  6 months of osu!supporter + *Musicians' Pick* profile badge

**The legend himself, *Kuba Oms*, will be a part of the Musician panel!**

That's not all though! When panel results are in, we'll combine them to form the overall top 5 entries. These will be open for a *community vote*, meaning you can pick your favorite entry!

Once the vote is finalized, we'll combine panel scores with community vote scores to determine the overall winner (weighting for each category is undecided).

This winner will be announced during a **live stream showcase of the finalists** with commentary from some of the judges!

### Overall prizes

- **Runner-up:**
    - 6 months of osu!supporter
    - *Overall runner-up* profile badge
- **Winner:**
    - 12 months of osu!supporter
    - *Overall winner* profile badge
    - *Elite Mapper*, *Elite Storyboarder*, and *osu!mixer* user titles
    - Submission bundled with new osu! downloads and fast-tracked to Ranked status

Also, in case one team wins both a specific panel and overall, the overall prizes will take priority!

## Rules

Follow these rules if you don't want your hard work to be disqualified. We'll notify teams about potential disqualification early so they can fix any issues.

- **Submission must be a "full beatmap experience" including the following:**
    - Remix of the song **Kuba Oms - My Love**
    - Beatmap spread following the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)
    - Storyboard or custom video
- **Submission must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Beatmaps must be in *osu!* game mode only.** Comparing beatmaps of different modes in a judging scenario is unfortunately not realistic.
- **Beatmaps should abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be questioned.
- **Team name and members must be confirmed through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjtVsUWIArvf--pKA0RLiCdXuO1_wO2Va2ICjenEcz9ZqI5Q/viewform).** If your country does not support Google forms, [send pishifat a message](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418). Teams are limited to 5 members.

Keep in mind that it is 100% acceptable to tease your submission publicly in this contest. You're making something cool, so you deserve to show it off!

## Remix usage rights

Kuba Oms is a cool dude. We're super grateful that he's given osu! players the tools and permission to remix his song.

Because these remixes will involve his copyrighted work, there's a few things all remixers must keep in mind (sourced directly from Kuba Oms): *The remixers can post their remixes on any and all social media, but they cannot sell, release, distribute, license or use the remixes for monetary gain without written consent from Kuba Oms.*
