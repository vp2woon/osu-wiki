Are you interested in helping keep the osu! community clean and enjoyable for everyone? The Global Moderation Team is now accepting applications for new members!

Once upon a distant past, the Global Moderation Team opened an application process to add new members to the team. We're pleased to announce that we're bringing it back!

The Global Moderation Team is primarily responsible for keeping the community enjoyable and pleasant for everyone by handling issues and troublemakers within the community. The team is responsible for watching people that are participating in the in-game chat and the forums to ensure that everyone is behaving amicably and respectfully towards each other. In addition, the team also regularly provides support for issues and answers questions that anyone might have.

The team has traditionally added new members through a recommendation process based on observed good behaviour and active presence in-game. While we will continue bringing in new members in this way, we know that not everyone is outspoken about voicing their interest in becoming a part of the team. We want to see who else is out there in the community that has what it takes to join the team.

Please note that we will be considering a few factors along with the answers you submit within the application:

- General requirements to join the GMT have not changed. You can read in detail about what we expect on [the GMT wiki page](/wiki/People/The_Team/Global_Moderation_Team#becoming-a-moderator), but in summary: you must be active in the in-game chat and/or the forums, you must demonstrate good behaviour by treating fellow community members with respect, you must possess a strong understanding of [osu!'s community rules](/wiki/Rules) and follow them, and you must already be contributing to bettering the community (by assisting other users, submitting reports for other users breaking the rules, etc.).
- Your account age must be older than one year to submit an application. Beyond that, we are ideally looking for people who have been in the community for several years.
- You must be able to communicate in English as most of the community is English speaking.
- You must have no major infractions on your account. This means any recent restrictions, multiaccount offenses, extended history of misbehaviour, etc. will disqualify you from consideration from the team.
- You must be willing to handle and moderate inappropriate content that is not suitable for all ages.
- If you are chosen as a candidate, it is expected that you will be active and behave in a manner befitting a moderator when interacting with the community upon joining the team.

We are not looking to fulfill any particular quota of new team members, so any number of qualified applicants may be added. While we are accepting applications from everyone, we are actively seeking new members who are able to help us with these languages: **Arabic, Czech, Dutch, Finnish, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Malaysian, Romanian, Portuguese, Spanish, Thai, and Vietnamese**.

If you are interested, [**please click here to apply**](https://pif.ephemeral.ink/gmtapps). You will be asked to authenticate using your osu! account prior to being presented with the application. Applications will be open for the next two weeks until the end of October 18th. We plan on continuing to run application periods in the future, so if you are interested but not prepared to make the step forward right now, you can start being active and helping out in the community now to be ready for the next application period.

Please be aware that we are expecting a large number of applications so it will take some time for all of the applications to be reviewed. Once we have reviewed all of the applications, you will be contacted by a member of the GMT if we deem you as a suitable addition to the team. We will also endeavour to send out messages to applicants who show promise but we find aren't quite ready yet, in order to try to help them to becoming a candidate to join the team in the future. For those who are accepted, the team currently uses Discord as a primary form of communication and we expect new members to be available on Discord to keep up to date with operations within the team.

Please feel free to drop any questions or concerns in the comments and feel free to reach out to any current GMT member about anything you may want to know. Good luck to everyone applying, and we hope to see some of you with us soon!
