Make some noise for **Silentroom**, our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/92/header.jpg)

An avid online music creator and contest competitor since 2012, **Silentroom** is a Japanese electronic producer with crazy levels of pure talent. His work has featured in a bunch of really popular rhythm games, like *Arcaea*, *Sound Voltex* and more, and to top it off, his contest-winning track *Nhelv* crowned him as the winner of *BOFU2017*.

We're super excited to announce that we've scored **20** tracks from across his discography, including *Nhelv* and a few other well-loved tracks.

On top of this, we've got two brand new showcase sets from the Mappers' Guild for both osu!catch and osu!mania, highlighting some of the scene's finest talents.

Check out what all the hype is about with these previews below:

All of the above plus a whole load more are available right now from [**Silentroom**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/92), all pre-timed and waiting for your attention. If you're one of the 90% of the planet that loved *Nhelv*, wait till you hear what else is in his catalogue!

Tweeter @WavesRevived absolutely nailed this week's hint, correctly deciphering it in full, including an explanation. Proto refers to "very beginnings", whilst glimmer is a synonym for flicker. Pairing the two together results in Protoflicker, a highly popular track from the artist. Well done!

This is our last release for July, but let me assure you that August is absolutely crammed full of more amazing Featured Artist releases. Keep a finger on the pulse of things by following the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/).

Until then, keep your eyes and ears peeled!
