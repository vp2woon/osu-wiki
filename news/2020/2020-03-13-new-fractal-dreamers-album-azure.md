Prepare for a journey beyond the skyline with **Fractal Dreamers** latest album, *Azure of the Horizon*!

Those following the work of the **Fractal Dreamers** might've noticed that they dropped a brand new album a few months back, featuring more of their classical-inspired electronica sound.

We're proud to announce that the *entire* album is now available [over at their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/15#album-207), with all **8 tracks** pre-packaged and ready to go.

The magnificently meticulous minds of the Mappers' Guild have historically had a field day with **Fractal Dreamers** work, so we're excited to see what everybody comes up with using the latest development in the journey that is their sound.

Check out a brief sample of what's new below:
