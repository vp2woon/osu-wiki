Do you like to draw? Do you like winter sports? If the answer to both of those questions is a firm YES, then you're a prime contestant for our last fanart contest of the year!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/header.jpg)

Continuing on with this year's trends of themed fanart contests (and Halloween, of course), we're turning up the heat by challenging all intrepid artists in our community to a new test of their creative skill:

**Draw any of the official osu! mascots or community mascots engaged in any form of winter sports**, and you could win both fun and glory!

If like me, you're confined to a part of the world where the only white flakes that fall from the sky happen to be *ash*, never fear - a handy list is here to help you figure out what counts:

- Skiing (in all forms)
- Ice skating (in all forms)
- Sledding (in all forms)
- Tobogganing
- Snowboarding
- Curling
- Most forms of recreational activity with the word 'ice' in front (climbing, racing, fishing, sailing, golf... don't ask)
- ...and anything else that would reasonably be considered as 'winter sports'!

Feeling inspired? Got something in mind to draw? You've got **14 days** from the date of this announcement post to put pen to paper and make it reality, following the rules laid out at the bottom of this newspost which you will read, because you are a wonderful person.

A top selection of the winners as voted by the community will make it onto the main menu as our Winter 2020 seasonal backgrounds, and all of said winners will receive 3 months of osu! supporter. The top three entries will also score themselves a profile badge detailing their place made from their own artwork.

Got all that? Great, now get all these rules in you too:

## Rules

- **All entries MUST be themed around winter sports and feature at least one official osu!mascot or community mascot.** Winter sports generally means sport activities that are generally *only* done in winter, but we've deliberately left it vague in this case so as not to stifle your artistic liberty.
- **All entries MUST be suitable for all-ages viewing.** You'd think winter would be the least likely contest to be affected by this sort of thing, but after one entry involving Mocha, ribbons and a Christmas tree, we're not taking any chances. For the record, this means no lewds, no gore, etc.
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK. REDRAWING AND COMPOSITE WORKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** Don't plagiarize. If you are taking ANYTHING that isn't a brush and redrawing it or reframing it, you're plagiarizing. Mixing a bunch of different people's drawings and backgrounds together is not producing original work.
- **ARTIST ATTRIBUTION (names, social media handles, etc) MUST BE LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THREE LINES TOTAL AND CONFINED TO EITHER THE BOTTOM LEFT OR BOTTOM RIGHT CORNERS OF YOUR ENTRY.** Being proud of your work is good, just do it in a reasonably small spot of your work. Please understand that we're not very fond of anything ad-related in osu!, and attribution that is blaring enough can be considered as one.
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece - namely 2732x1536. THIS IS CHECKED BY A SCRIPT AND ENTRIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE DISCARDED AUTOMATICALLY.** This is the #1 reason for entries not making it to voting phase. MAKE SURE YOUR ENTRY MEETS THE EXACT RESOLUTION REQUIREMENTS ABOVE. Check your work after you've exported it and BEFORE you submit it. People have been really good about this during the past few contests, please keep it going!
- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed on the main menu and during the voting process.** Anything you draw that is inside the dotted circle won't be seen during voting phase, because we super-impose an osu! cookie over all entries during voting phase to simulate what they're going to look like on the main menu. Please accommodate for this in your drawing!
- **DO NOT LEAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR SUBMISSION!**
- ***DO NOT LEAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR SUBMISSION!***
- **DO NOT LEAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR SUBMISSION!**
- **Don't use copyrighted characters from other intellectual properties.** All the official osu! mascots and the community mascots are fair game, but please avoid using representations of characters from other worlds or franchises in your work. Remember also that the community mascots are someone else's treasured creation, so please treat them with the same respect that you'd treat your own OCs and work.

Once you're all suited up and ready to submit your entry, head on over to the [Winter Sports 2020 Fanart Contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/114) and make it happen.

To all those who are entering, good luck, and have fun!
