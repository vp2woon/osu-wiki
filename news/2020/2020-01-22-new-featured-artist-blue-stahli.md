**Blue Stahli** barges on in as the latest addition to the Featured Artist lineup!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/65/header.jpg)

Blasting on in from the beyond, you've probably heard **Blue Stahli** somewhere else long before osu!. From mortal scare-fests like the *Final Destination* movies to the visually stunning science-action thriller *Tron: Legacy* and even the zombie-toppling rampage of *Dead Rising 2*, our latest artist has been around the block for a walk or two with his work.

Now, he's here, with **27** tracks from across 3 albums and a variety of singles available for your mapping escapades. And not to be outdone, the Mappers' Guild continues their streak of providing brand new preview beatmaps for you to sink your teeth into.

Not convinced? Give these tracks a listen, and click the links above the sound bars to check out some maps set to these wicked tracks, both new and old:

As is the usual, all of the above plus a hell of a lot more are available right now over at [**Blue Stahli**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/65), pre-timed and awaiting your artistic input.

Continuing the trend of galaxy-brain shoutouts, Reddit user /u/Jalienet nailed this week's shorter-form hint almost instantly. Perhaps we'll make the next hint a little harder.

New week means another new Featured Artist in a pace that just keeps on giving. We're now not really that far off nearly two thousand total tracks, which is kind of incredible if you think about it for a little bit. If you're digging for a hint regarding the next release, keep an eye on [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) over the next week or so.
