We're excited to welcome **Sennzai** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/110/header.jpg)

Renowned across the Japanese doujin music scene for her powerful and incredibly versatile voice, **Sennzai** is a lyricist and vocalist with some serious musical chops. Her voice has featured in games like *Deemo*, *Arcaea*, *maimai*, *CHUNITHM*, *pop'n music* and more, and on top of that, she's collaborated with a huge variety of some of Japan's most talented producers, like *Blacklolita*, *Feryquitous*, *PSYQUI* and way, way more.

We're proud to announce that today's release encompasses **20** tracks featuring **Sennzai**'s critically acclaimed vocals from across nearly a dozen doujin artists.

If you were around back during the days where we signed a few music labels on board (such as *High Tea Music*, *Rising Sun Traxx* and others), this release will feel similar in terms of the raw, unbridled variety now available - except *all* of them feature **Sennzai**'s vocal mastery at the front and centre.

Don't expect much of the same thing either - **Sennzai**'s musical versatility is incredible, she sings pretty much everything. Not only that, but we've got a brand new Mappers' Guild showcase map to welcome her aboard, hosted by one of the few contest-winning beatmappers around!

Check out a sample below:

All of the above plus a bunch more are available right now over at [**Sennzai**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/110), pre-timed and ready to go. There's so much variety in her work that you're seriously doing yourself a disservice by not checking it out!

The Featured Artist train chugs along ever onwards, with **Sennzai** marking the 10th artist added since we crossed our big 100 artist milestone over a month ago with *EPICA*. We hope you're enjoying the double-time pace, since there's no sign of it slowing down soon!

Keep tabs on all the latest news over at the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame), and we'll see you again on Saturday for another wicked release.
