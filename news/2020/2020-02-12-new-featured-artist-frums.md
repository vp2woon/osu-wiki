As per usual, these tracks and a whole lot more can be found on **[Frums' Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/68)**, ready for you to load into the editor and (with these songs in particular) create what could become the most controversial map of the year.

Congratulations to Twitter user Tatatat01, who correctly guessed our Twitter hint with blazing speed. Monstrata gets an honorable mention for his guess of Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre, being only 150 years and several creative domains apart, which is still closer to the mark than the usual 'Dragonforce' guesses.

Anywho, this train has no brakes so as per usual, a new Featured Artist will be crashing your way next week! Take a peek at the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) in a few days to see your fate a bit earlier than the rest of the crowd.
