For those of you craving fresh, new heavy-hitting aural content, what better way to kick off our first release of the 2020's than with the diverse, rich sound of progressive death metal behemoth, **Rivers of Nihil**?

A trailblazer in the evolution of modern death metal, we've snagged **8** select tracks off of their most recent, widely-praised venture into new territory: *Where Owls Know My Name*.

The release marks a cardinal juncture in the band's musical development whose momentum continues to snowball following the album's highly acclaimed launch.

*Where Owls Know My Name* is a nonpareil idyll among metal records of the last few years. Take a listen below:
