A long forgotten treasure reappears at last, this map is full of old style awkward jumps and linear aim patterns you come to expect from old mapping, in a slight departure from the more modern CRN style. Weighing in at over 8.5\*, it's a test for the mechanics as much as it is for the reading, so if you're up for a challenge on an old boss map, where patterns and rhythms that rarely appear these days are thrown at you constantly, then give this a go - just don't expect an easy ride.

Who doesn't like a classic JoJo opening? This mapset features a full spread of seven difficulties of this catchy 136 BPM song. All difficulties are mapped in a nice, clean style, leading to an enjoyable gameplay experience no matter what kind of player you are. Whether you're looking for a new map to full combo or just here for the music, this mapset is here for you and waiting for your vote to bring it into the Loved category!

*description written by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

There are tons of stream maps in this game, but unfortunately, many of them seem to only cater to the top of the top players, being extremely high in star rating and featuring insane stream spacing. While this map is difficult in its own right, it's much more approachable as a challenging stream map for those looking to either train their streaming skills or simply play along with the song. The map is 180 BPM and rests in the mid 5-star range, and the streams are fairly spaced to provide an enjoyable challenge.

Taking a break from all the intense maps the Loved category has seen, sometimes it's important to chill out and play some 5-star, 186 BPM jumps to an innocent and catchy Japanese song. This map is perfect for those of you who like relaxing maps and long strolls through flower fields, basking in the sun while you reminisce on your past and appreciate the finer things in- wait, where was I again? Oh, right. The map itself is 90 seconds long, so it's right in that sweet spot for those of you who don't do with longer maps. Check it out!

There are very few maps out there that challenge players as uniquely as rustbell's maps do, and this map is a perfect example of the quality that these maps display. This is a four minute, 7-star map of a relaxing yet energetic song that features long 1/6 jump sections and streams at 152 BPM. The various jump angles are iconic to rustbell's style and make for a one-of-a-kind gameplay experience that almost no other map can offer.

Nattu and Ciyus Miapah are two mappers known for making marathon maps that almost feel like osu! boss battles. From the song choice to the distinctly variant sections of the map, topped off by being fully hitsounded, storyboarded, and polished, their collaboration map of *FireLight* takes the spot as the next boss battle entering the gates of Loved. This map in particular is 190 BPM, surpasses 8 stars in difficulty, rests above 5 minutes in length, and is ready for you to show it your best skills.

It's uncommon for someone to have the dedication to finish a 6 minute map, it's rare for someone to have the dedication to map intricately timed songs, and it's a feat to honor for someone to make a high quality map with those conditions. With that said, let's take a look at this masterpiece mapped by Snepif: this 6 minute map features a grand total of 359 red ticks and maintains impeccable quality at a 7-star difficulty range. The map itself features the widest array of patterns, from unique jump patterns to fast streams to some of the most unique rhythms you'll ever find in an osu! map. Overall, this map truly is one of a kind. Don't skip this one.

How was your summer this year? Many of you must have had a lonely summer with the corona epidemic and the cancellation of various events...
Then this mapset came up, which was created by five famous Japanese mappers and it's a "festive" one at that!
The fact that they've reached 1,000 playcount despite being in pending status is a testament to the various ingenuity of the five of them!
There are 5 BPMs available, and this mapset is a step-by-step challenge from the lower difficulty levels, even if you're not confident in your skills. If you're confident in your skills... you could add a mod! Why not end the summer this year with a good feeling and a great beatmap?

Here comes Nanahira's cool song called *Super-Slow-Internet-san* with its representation by POCARI SWEAT. One of the currently popular maps with a pretty unusual style.
There are no high bpm bursts, 1/6 and doublets spam but only patterns of all kinds of variations and overall slow speed which will challenge every player's reading skill who decides to play it. This map shows a good example of conceptual Low SV usage throughout the entirety of the song, even though there are not so many maps that do this.
Despite its tangible difficulty, the patterns are mostly simplistic but it does not make this map any less interesting, thus many players like it.

Creeper? Aww man... Besides the meme, here we brought to you a beatmap of a world-famous song's remix, *Revenge (ReeK's "Dude, What's A Genre?" Remix)*, mapped by yuzu__rinrin & KTYN. As the original song features a bunch of genres mixed up, this beatmap challenges you with osu!taiko's representative pattern styles, like 1/6 tech, big burst, constant high speed, offbeat and SV changes.\
Even with those tough pattern style variations, thanks to those brilliant mappers they're well balanced, very fun and fair enough to give you a great experience of a unique genre switching map.

The map chosen for this month is Feelin Sky (Camellia's "200step" Self-remix), well done and popularly known by the public because of the incredible artist Camellia. The mapper Zyzyx is not a regular mapper, his maps are full of creativity and imagination. Feelin Sky is no exception, the map uses a lot of straight patterns combined with hyperdashes, and you can see a lot of sliders having internal hypers which are not quite popular by year 2018. The wub sections are expressed with different streams and high density horizontal movement, it could be challenging for players. In conclusion, I think this is a glorious map and it deserves to have a spot in loved section.

Fii is well known for her neat and structurally high-quality mapping style. And this map here is a little more difficult than her usual one. Compared to recent specific maps, this map may not be that difficult. Nevertheless, anti-flow and 1/8 streams can still be a challenge for many players. On the one hand, Fii's mapping, which is not too difficult and pursues the right level of difficulty, may help more people get used to the maps like this. She's been away for a long time, and for now, it's best to let this map go to Loved and enjoy it for a lot of people.

Almost everyone will know the osu!standard map of this song, [DJ Sharpnel - StrangeProgram](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/5774), the one with the pretty awesome storyboard that will throw you off at any moment while playing.
Now this map is created by Razor Sharp, known for his pretty fast and technical maps, both ranked, loved and unranked.
This map was inspired by [Lesjuh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/44308), the creator of the osu!standard map's TAG difficulty, recreating a lot of the patterns from Lesjuh's map, while giving it just a slight twist so that it becomes a lot harder and fits osu!catch a lot better. The map will be quite hard to SS as it contains a lot of fast sliders with a bunch of awkward droplets making it one of those maps that you should be proud of if you will be able to SS it.

If you have been around as long as I have (or even longer), then you likely encountered this map at some point. *Play Tetris With Your Lolis :3* mapped by katsek was uploaded in 2011 and used to be a popular pick in high-tier multiplayer sessions. Like most of the old maps, this map focuses on very precise movements and with it being AR8 it also challenges your low AR reading. If you are going for an FC, you better be ready for a lot of restarts to learn all the accurate movements you need to make. If you play this with any mod, you will suffer.

f you like the style older maps have, there is a high chance you will enjoy this map too. And even if you don't usually play these types of maps, please make sure to give this cool map at least a try!

It has been a while, but here we have another map from our dear Japanese friends: noraRcat and Furely! Nice! The difficulty between the maps in this set does not really vary too much, despite there being three, but they are all fairly doable by players that are slightly more advanced in terms of skill level. Other than that it is the typical type of mapset you would expect from these guys: focus on the fun, not the formalities. Despite there being no absolutely ridiculous game-breaking patterns in this mapset, they still aren't designed with ranking criteria in mind, and are meant primarily for entertainment. You have some cool jumps, few streams, and it all fits the song quite well! Oh yeah, and about the song: it's an absolute (ok this is very much subjective, but I am gonna estimate most people agree with this statement) BANGER! But that tends to be fairly common with Walkure's music.\
All in all, you hopefully catch my drift when I say that this makes for a very fun map! So walk your way towards your PC and check it out! (Gosh that is the 3rd bad artist pun I made up in a row, awesome!)

We all know Wh1teh for his many popular and high quality charts, many of which have already been moved into Loved, with notable entrants including [TAKECORE OF YOURSELF](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/480479#mania/1026050), [LA MD](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/455656#mania/976620), and [Eighto](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/584698#mania/1237015). Yet again we are seeing a chart of theirs nominated into the Loved Section in *Shounanzoku -cannibal coast-*, a chart that focuses primarily on dumping the vocals and layering the percussion to create quick, but relatively comfortable and satisfying jumpstream gameplay.

The consistent nature of this representation makes it a joy to play through and with few breaks, something to keep players interested throughout, and can serve well as a stamina and consistency tester.  The satisfaction and testing ability of this chart has garnered a decent amount of support, and combining these qualities makes it an excellent nominee for the Loved section.

185 BPM, 2:36 | \[4K\] 5.29★

A familiar face in the Loved section, Ticle returns to voting with *99 Glooms*. Ticle has made a name for himself as a very expressive mapper, taking much advantage of flowy patterns and long note releases. *99 Glooms* is a prime example of Ticle's signature style, filled with tricky patterns that one might almost describe as slippery or smooth, which is quite reflective of the music at many points. The map pushes the player into a state of focus and concentration with the immense usage of mini-LNs, which have to be released very quickly and precisely, and the fine utilization of staggered releases throughout the map; the usage of long notes with varying lengths also creates a tension that drives the player to pay closer attention. Ticle is also shown to be fairly creative and detailed in the manners in which particular sounds are expressed -- the map often leverages short, light, and quick bursts, which articulate on the lighter nature of the instruments like the piano and guitar, and there are multiple instances towards the end where the long notes which correspond a particular synth are seen to gradually get longer to represent a crescendo.

Overall, *99 Glooms* is a great experience for a wide range of players, not only due to how tricky it can get even for the most experienced of long note enthusiasts, but also because of the musical detail that is expressed. It's about time that this map got its chance to shine in the Loved section.

Slow jacks and jumptrills, dumpy streams and bursts, and a special something spelled out in quads are the defining features of our next pick, *LUVORATORRRRRY!*, an exciting and bouncy song by Giga-P complimented very well with the chart laid out by Fullerene-!

The different parts of the song are met with quite variable pattern types, with the sung vocals throughout the song taking the form of dumped streams and bursts, with the rap-esque vocals corresponding to slow jack patterns, and then jumptrills and quads to the synth buildups that happen twice. The set even includes two difficulties, so that the message spelled out in the quads can be deciphered by both upscroll and downscroll users (Upscroll players can see it in "On Top", and downscroll can see it in "Down Below").

The bouncy and variable nature of the song and chart make it no wonder why it gained its popularity in the first place, and that popularity is sure to carry over to it with its nomination to the Loved section.

[MuryokuP - Catastrophe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/108862#mania) by [Entozer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/277044)\
200 BPM, 2:49 | \[7K\] 1.06★, \[7K\] 2.41★, \[7K\] 3.46★, \[7K\] 3.65★, \[7K\] 4.82★

An ancient chart for osu!mania's timeline, *Catastrophe* is one of those charts that still sees a lot of play even up to today. Harkening to its classical O2Jam roots, this mapset offers difficulties catering to a wide playerbase showcasing its laning oriented notecharting. Serving as a neat throwback to older styles of notecharting, this is one of the more memorable charts out there and should be given a shot.

[Poppin’Party - KIZUNA MUSIC (TV Size)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1124865#mania) by [Jerry](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/605973)\
189 BPM, 1:27 | \[7K\] 1.91★

To the uninitiated, this may look like an out of place low difficulty chart with an absurd amount of favorites but they're in for a pleasant surprise! *KIZUNA MUSIC* is a storyboard driven chart which brings the girls band party to osu!mania full on with gameplay elements and sprites. Just don't expect gacha for this one.
