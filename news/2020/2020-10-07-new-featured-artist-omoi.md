01.23? More like 07.10! We're proud to welcome **Omoi**, the artist of Snow Drive and Teo aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

You know them, you love them, **Omoi** are the enigmatic duo of Sakurai and Kimura, responsible for a huge number of electro-rock VOCALOID hits that have been super popular in osu! since the early days.

First explored by Yales back in 2015 with a [series of well-received maps](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=%22omoi%22%20%22yales%22) and later brought into the limelight well and truly by Kroytz' enormously popular collaborative sets for both [Snow Drive \(01.23\)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/478405) and [Teo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/721804), **Omoi** now officially joins the ever-growing roster of timeless osu! classics brought under the banner of the Featured Artist project.

On top of that, we've got a prime selection of **24** new tracks now available from across three albums and a bunch of singles.

Don't know what all the hype is about? We bet you do, just take a listen to a brief snippet of what's available below:
