**ARForest** joins the lineup as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/95/header.jpg)

A South Korean hardcore and artcore producer, [**ARForest**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/95) is most well known for his wide catalog of works across the rhythm gaming community, with his pieces featuring in games like *OverRapid*, *Dynamix*, *Lanota* and *ToneSphere* just to name a few.

Fans of that classic rhythm game elegant aesthetic (you'll know what we mean the second you hear it) have a lot to look forward to with this release, as we not only bring in a large quantity of existing work with this week's selection of **19** tracks, but a whole bunch of new stuff that we think you'll love — including two new showcase maps from the ever-talented Mappers' Guild.

Don't just take our word for it though, give his stuff a quick listen below:

You know the drill by now — all of the above plus a whole bunch more are available right now from [**ARForest**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/95) pre-timed and just waiting for you to fill in the gaps with your own creative genius.

Two weeks in a row, the Hintern claims victory again, with this week's hint less of an actual hint and more like a homage. "The heart echoes" refers to a flair quip in the description of [\[ A v a l o n \]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4632359)'s map for [Final Resonance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/909666) which has clocked over 200k plays since it was ranked in 2019. Keep tabs on your osu! lore, people!

That's all for this week, but we'll be back again at the same time next week with another extraordinarily talented artist for you. Stay on top of all things osu! by following the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame), and until then, enjoy your circle clicking!
