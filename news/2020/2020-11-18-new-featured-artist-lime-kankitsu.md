**Lime / Kankitsu** hops on board as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/116/header.jpg)

Few artists give off a genuine rhythm-game vibe comparable to **Lime / Kankitsu**. His works have been featured in *maimai*, *MUSYNC*, and *Muse Dash*, plus he's been a contributor to *BMS OF FIGHTERS* events for a decade!

We're stoked to announce that we've snagged **13** tracks from **Lime / Kankitsu**'s catalogue. There's high chances that you've heard some of these bass-pounding sensations, including classics like *Smiling* and *Renai Syndrome*.

**Lime / Kankitsu** is no stranger to the ranked section, but even so, the Mappers' Guild has been hard at work to produce modern additions to the list!

If you still need convincing, try soaking up some of these hits:

Take a trip to [**Lime / Kankitsu's Featured Artist listing**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/116) and craft your newest map using any of the pre-timed templates. Oh, and if you're an osu!catch mapper, we expect you to use green combo colours to follow the *Lime* theme (please, it'll be funny, I swear).

Be sure to watch the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for even more osu! news, and come back on Saturday for the announcement of yet another Featured Artist!

Until then!
