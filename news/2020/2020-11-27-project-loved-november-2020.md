[Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) is back yet again! Take a peek at the maps we picked out for you this month and cast your vote to decide their fate!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)

In case you're new here: Project Loved runs monthly polls to decide which unranked maps enter the [Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved) category, as selected by each mode's captains. Throughout this post, you can click on each map's banner to go to its poll, where you can vote for whether or not you want the map Loved. Voting is open for 10 days, starting right now! You can read more about how Project Loved works on its [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved).

Before we get into the maps selected for this month, the Project Loved Team would like to extend our gratitude and farewell to one of our osu!catch captains—[Yumeno Himiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1806962)—as they have retired from their position. They have been around with the project for a very long time and their contributions to the osu!catch Loved scene cannot be understated and we greatly appreciate their time & service! We hope the future holds great things for them and we thank them for everything they've done for the project! With that out of the way, here are our picks for the month of November.

[Nasko - Break Through](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/657084#osu) by [Evgerable](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5657937)\
115 BPM, 3:50 | 1.96★ – 7.33★

There are lots of jumpy songs out there on osu!, but few of them make me really want to jump like this one does. This mapset is a full spread of a high-energy 115 BPM song, ranging between 2 and 7 stars in difficulty, and—you guessed it—being quite jumpy in mapping style as well. There's a difficulty here for everyone regardless of skill level, so come see what all the hype is about with this mapset!

[Caravan Palace - Miracle](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/948225#osu) by [Mulciber](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8062785)\
200 BPM, 3:12 | 5.88★

Let's be honest, is there a single Caravan Palace song that isn't a bop? Topping that with a super clean and enjoyable mapping style from Mulciber gets you this amazing 6-star map that's reached nearly 300 favourites in total. At a comfortable 200 BPM, this is a super fun map to get lost in the music with while you jump around your cursor.

145 – 291 BPM, 3:33 | 4.85★ – 5.72★

Songs like these are so mesmerising to listen to, and pairing them with fun maps makes it super easy to get lost in the music. Despite the five difficulties of this mapset being from five different mappers, they each used sliders and alternating patterns in super creative and engaging ways to represent the repetitive sounds of the music, so no matter which difficulty you're playing, you won't need to worry about the map quality, as they're all super enjoyable. Overall, this is an amazing mapset to get a mix of creative maps to play around the 5-star range while playing along to a super fun song, so check it out!

132 – 264 BPM, 1:14 | 2.61★ – 8.99★

This mapset is truly an expression of creativity. Being a cheerful and upbeat song associated with the VTuber Pekora, this mapset has garnered over 200 favourites from those who have come to experience this incredible song with even more incredible osu! maps. Each difficulty is super unique and the star ratings range drastically throughout the mapset. While it's hard to know exactly what you're getting into with each difficulty, you can take my word in saying that you won't be able to find a gameplay experience like this one in many other mapsets out there. Have fun!

130 BPM, 4:19 | 5.05★, 7.30★

This mapset complements the ranked mapset of this song perfectly in offering two super enjoyable maps with star ratings that aren't found in the ranked mapset. These maps by 9ami and 2lewd provide a really fun challenge mapped to a fun and upbeat song. Don't just take my word for it, though: this has reached nearly 400 favorites in under a year, so it's time to bring it to the public and show you all what exactly makes it stand out.

[Two Door Cinema Club - Undercover Martyn](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/846601#osu) by [TheCosmicWolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8352298)\
160 BPM, 2:43 | 7.09★

It's a really interesting experience when a chill song is mapped with super difficult patterns, but when it's executed well, boy is it fun. This 7-star map by TheCosmicWolf is a perfect example of that, being a relatively chill 160 BPM song mapped with 320 BPM jump and alternating patterns in every kiai of the map. As I said, this map is executed super well, so if you want to know exactly what I'm talking about, give this map a try for yourself!

140 BPM, 3:31 | 8.25★

In a game like osu!, it's hard to quantify exactly how skilled you are at certain aspects. Thankfully, there are maps like this one that provide a clean challenge of your aim abilities at a super high degree, being filled with 210 BPM jumps that reach the point of being spaced across the screen. With over 230 favourites to its name, this 8-star jump map is one of the most popular maps of its kind. If you're looking for a map to test the upper limits of your aim abilities, this is one of the best maps out there to do so on!

139 BPM, 1:38 | 6.86★

This map feels like a final boss of sorts when it comes to grid mapping with its dense approach rate, perfect stacks, and super refined gimmick. Despite not even being two minutes in length, fanzhen's map of *Kecak* has been known to challenge the most dedicated gimmick players in the world. How do your skills fare?

170 BPM, 4:04 | 5.97★

I think we all have this general understanding that sometimes the star rating of a map doesn't perfectly reflect how difficult a map is, but just how far can some maps push that rule? This map doesn't even pass 6 stars in difficulty, yet it's easily one of the most challenging and cleanly mapped technical maps that exist. Nearly every other slider changes speed, and nearly every object is a slider. Couple that with the fact that every slider is strategically mapped nearly to the point of perfection and you get yourself one of the most unforgiving challenges of a technical map out there. If you've been dying for a break from all the jumpy and generic maps out there, you *need* this map.

155 BPM, 5:32 | 6.91★, 6.92★

A lot of us already know of [the Ranked short version](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/10112) of this song mapped by [Lesjuh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/44308): with over 3 million plays, it's easily one of the most iconic old maps in the game. However, this modern take of the song by Mismagius takes the challenge to another level by mapping the 5-minute extended mix of the song at a star rating well beyond the Ranked one, resting just under 7 stars. The map is full of intense and creative alternating patterns and unique rhythms. Five times the length, five times the fun. What's not to love?

When I got on the bus I wasn't expecting such a smooth, graceful ride, but with uone in the driver's seat it seems you won't be getting anything less. Capitalizing on the recent TUYU hype, uone delivers an unconventional, yet clean and classy map that will really leave you wishing it was longer. If it seems too easy but you don't quite have the horsepower for DoubleTime, he's even tacked on a "speedup" difficulty just for you! There's not much else to say but... Having amassed over 900 plays and 19 favorites while still in the graveyard, there's a high chance you know this map better than I do.

*Off Tha Heezie* is an amazing representation of the juke & footwork genre that is incredibly catchy and guaranteed to stay around in your head for a long while. Which is great, as Jaye's map is one full of ninja notes and highspeed patterns that require extreme reading and pattern memorization if you're aiming towards a full combo, with simple but effective patterns and grindy 1/6 that could make it difficult to catch those two "dons" in the blue note waves. This is truly an amazing map that is highly reminiscent of the song's style and fun to the point that it's less of an annoying grind trying to get those ninjas down than you would expect. Enjoy!

*Super-Slow-Internet-san* is back, but this time it's "Super-Fast"! The beatmap is, literally, super fast... but there are also super slow parts that challenge the player's ability to adapt. It's just like the occasional unstable internet in our own homes... The note colors are simple, but can you hit them at this insanely high speed? Give it a shot on this "Super-Fast" remix and map!

Kyuare, a very known mapper throughout the osu!catch community, maps a wide variety of maps and each one of them has a unique vibe to it. *Destiny* isn't any different, it's a very solid overdose having a nice buildup going into the kiai, having a bunch of streams, jumps and even a hyperdash chain around the 1000 combo mark. All in all, it's a map that a lot of players can play, while the higher ranked players will be able to full combo it, probably adding some mods on top of that as well.

Wait... We have Crowley maps in Loved?! Oh yeah we do! *Yuudachi no Ribbon* is admittedly a project that was supposed to go for Ranked, but that project of Crowley's was abandoned in the last year and a half, despite the very high quality of the mapset. Hereby we grant it the shine it deserves. *Yuudachi no Ribbon* has 4 difficulties ranging from a salad up to an overdose, meaning that, you guessed it, there is something to play for players of all skill levels. The "Downpour" difficulty of the mapset might come across as too easy for players of the highest skill level, but adding the HardRock mod to it increases the difficulty by quite a huge margin, as the jumps become really challenging timing-wise. To finish all of that off: the song, in my honest opinion, is really solid! It provides for quite a comfortable listening experience. So hereby I give my imaginary Loved pick ribbon to Crowley for being a great mapper with good taste in music! Do also check out the mapset and see for yourself if Crowley deserves a ribbon from you!

Badis' maps have always posed some challenges to players, and this map is one of them. In contrast to modern maps, his maps also actively employ edge dashes and show a pursuit of pattern diversity. Another thing to praise about his map is that unlike other unranked mappers, he always puts effort into the hitsounding. The feedback of the appropriately added hitsounds has a very positive effect on the playability of the map, making it much more enjoyable to play. Not only older players but also newer players will be able to enjoy this map.

Kuzino is certainly a name that comes to mind when you think about old mappers that made lots of good quality maps. The ones that have been Loved already show that the community definitely enjoys their mapping style and *Chocolate* is no exception to the rule. This is a map that does not require speed like most of today's maps, but rather tests your timing and catcher control. Due to the hyperdash change back in 2012, some of the jumps became more tricky than necessary because of the timing needed to catch them, but it is still very much possible to get a full combo. Both older and newer players can fully enjoy and experience this map, so make sure to give it a shot!

150 BPM, 2:34 | \[4K\] 4.67★

Omae wa mo shindeiru. An iconic phrase that has beget many memes, jokes, and in this case, songs and charts. One such song is Virtual Riot's *Shindeiru*, charted by Gekido-. Gekido- is no stranger to the Loved section, having been nominated for many popular and impressive tech and LN charts alike, such as [Chik Habit](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/732982) and [The Clockwork Rose](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/740979). This pattern continues with *Shindeiru*, an extremely technical and bursty file that will catch you off-guard if you aren't fully ready for the speed and difficulty of the patterns throughout. Outside of the bursts there are also some extended jack patterns that can be difficult to transition in and out of, especially with the one-handed trills that go along with them. It is a difficult and satisfying chart, but if you aren't up to the challenge, you may already be dead.

The storm is back, and it's hitting harder than ever. In this month's edition of Project Loved, we bring to you *Tornado* by inteliser, a heavy, masterfully crafted chart and a relic of its time. As a fairly well-known mapper in the community, inteliser is certainly well acquainted with the Loved section, with maps like [Mirage](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/486877) and [Dodger's Gadget (UNMIXED)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/727666) -- though this map particularly strays away from the LN-based direction that players are more accustomed to in inteliser's Loved maps. This map almost entirely tests physicality and technicality -- spanning no less than four minutes, this map barely gives any breaks, filled to the brim with extremely difficult and dense jack and burst patterns clocking in at 175 BPM. This map has been featured in multiple large tournaments, including the finals pool of MWC 2020. As a challenging stamina-intensive chart, its persistent popularity among competitive players throughout the years has shown that it has stood the test of time and well deserves its spot in the Loved section. TO-TO-TO-TORNADO!

Do you like super fast cars? Do you like eurobeat? Are fast-paced action-packed experiences really your thing? If your answer to any of these questions is yes, then the *SUPER EUROBEAT FOR RUNNING SELECTIONS VOL.2* pack created by Jole just might be what you are looking for. The pack is filled with excitement, with 8 eurobeat bops perfect for the osu!mania drift legend living within you. Each one mapped in a fun and dynamic way, with some speed dumps, minijacks, fast jumpstream, and in some cases a combination of them. Just like the first volume that has already made its way into the Loved section, it's gained immense popularity through the range of difficulty and approachability, the exciting song choice, and the fun that the charts themselves bring. It really is a no-brainer to nominate this pack after the great success of the first pack.

This month, we bring you another LN-based multi-keymode set by ruka and Flexo123 -- *Hanjuuryoku no Machi*. With 4K and 7K difficulties, this mapset has gained sizable popularity as a fun experience accompanied with a light-hearted song. The 4K difficulty, mapped by ruka, is mostly streamy with inverse jumpstreams, flams and bursts, and some long inverse streams; it is a welcoming and familiar experience to players who are accustomed to these kinds of charts. The 7K difficulty by Flexo123 is similar, with an emphasis on long notes and larger chords. With a variety of LN-based patterns, this mapset overall provides a very enjoyable time for those who play LN maps, and thus deserves a spot in the Loved section.

300 BPM, 1:50 | \[7K\], 1.04★ – 10.55★

For this month, 7K is about to deliver a heaping serving of rice starting off with a Blocko's *Hold Angel*. In classic Blocko fashion, we're met with a huge spread which caters to just about every skill level. The primary theme of the set is simple -- to test the technical control of the player. The lower diffs start off with repetitive and somewhat brackety 150 1/4 streaming. The middle tier of diffs which are the most played diffs in the set starts featuring bursts and mild wristjacking which places an emphasis on the control element of the set. Finally, the top diffs are very difficult scoring files to test reading, control, chordjack ability, and the stamina of everyone who wants to gauge their abilities. This one of the rarer instances of a set that fits everyone and so it deserves a shot at gaining a Loved status.

[BRIGHT - Ichinen Nikagetsu Hatsuka](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/895652#mania) by [Kawawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4647754) and [Remuring](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6522146)\
131 BPM, 2:57 | \[7K\] 5.14★, \[7K\] 5.58★, \[7K\] 6.01★, \[7K\] 6.46★, \[7K\] 6.89★

If wristjacks and control aren't quite your pace, we have a more chordstream oriented pick for this round. This collaboration between Kawawa and Remuring brings us a training chart with a fairly catchy song. As the difficulty names imply, brackets are the name of the game for this map. The set owner has done a considerate job of indicating the equivalent skill level for each rate with DT included. When factoring in HT, we have a range of 89 BPM up to 251 BPM as points of practice! Like the many people who have played this map, it's time for you to work on those bracketing skills!
