We're proud to welcome **Joe Ford** aboard as our latest addition to the Featured Artist lineup!

Something of a rising star in the drum & bass scene, **Joe Ford** has been turning heads ever since 2011, drawing the support of big-name fixtures in the scene and making appearances on labels like *Hospital* and *Shogun*.

Astute followers might've noticed that we've seen some of **Joe Ford**'s work in the Featured Artist program already, particularly his collaborative track with *Culprate* titled *Gaucho* under the *Unity Project* albums.

We're excited to announce that we're really filling that out today, with **38** new tracks now available featuring many of his signature hi-tech drum & bass hits.

Check out a sample below:
