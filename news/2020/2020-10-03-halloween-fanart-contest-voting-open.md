AHHH! Largest fanart contest showing ever, for reals this time! Too many entries, too few votes, read on for more info.

You heard us right - this year's Halloween Fanart Contest is our BIGGEST one ever. How big? **216** entries big.

That's a LOT of art. And unfortunately for you, there's only **20** votes per person to go around, so you better make yours count!

Check out a quick sample of what's up for voting, set to the wicked tunes of our very own [cYsmix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/2):

Got what you want to vote for in mind? Head over to the [**Halloween 2020 Fanart Contest listing**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/112) and vote for your picks right this very instant!

The voting will only remain open for **7 days**, and in case you've forgotten, a selection of the top-voted entries will make it onto the main menu as spooky month 2020's seasonal background pieces, plus nab their artists a little bit of osu!supporter for their hard work.

So remember, less posting timestamps of the pieces you like in the comments, and more shooting stars on the contest listing for your favorite pieces!

Good luck!
