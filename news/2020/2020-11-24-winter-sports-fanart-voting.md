Like what you see? Don't post timestamps in the comments, DO head on over to the [**Winter Sports 2020 Fanart Contest** listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/114) and cast your votes for your favorites today!

As usual, the voting will remain open for only **7 days**, so make sure you get in early before you get snowed in.

A selection of the top-voted entries will make it to the main menu as Winter's seasonal backgrounds to cap off 2020 (at long, long last).

Now, good luck, and go vote!
