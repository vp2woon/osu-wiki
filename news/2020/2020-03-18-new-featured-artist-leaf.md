We're proud to welcome **LeaF** aboard as our latest addition to the Featured Artist roster!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/73/header.jpg)

Those with particularly calamitous fortunes are likely well acquainted with the wonder that is **LeaF** and his genre-defying rhythmic mastery. From tracks like *Calamity Fortune*, *MEPHISTO*, *Wizdomiot*, *I*, *Evanescent* and more, we've seen a LOT of **LeaF** over the course of osu!'s history, with many of the beatmaps charted to his work serving as cultural icons in their own right.

We've lined up **30** tracks for you to test your mapping mettle with, in a variety of short and extended versions to boot.

In case you're not in the know, check out a sample of some of his work below:

All of the above plus a whole lot more are available right now over at [**LeaF**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/73), so head on over and sink your teeth into a collection of tracks that thrived during the golden age of osu! mapping, all 100% free and just waiting for your fresh new take.

Tweeters @TheEggowo, @DrLou15, @iSpecYou and @sucuhaamane all take home the prize of correctly nabbing this week's hint. Congratulations! For those wondering, "verzweiflung" briefly features as accent text in the video for *Calamity Fortune*. Blink and you'd miss it.

We've reached another informal milestone with this release, namely the big two-thousand track mark. If you took all of our Featured Artist tracks and stuck them into one playlist, you'd have nearly a week's worth of unique tracks playing non-stop, spanning over 15 genres. Damn.

Stay tuned for more mind-boggling statistics to be released later in the week courtesy of the Mappers' Guild, and check the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) mid-way through for more juicy tidbits and hints for next week's release.
