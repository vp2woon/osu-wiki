You've had your say, and in some of the closest voting we've ever seen in a fanart contest to date, the winners have been decided for all to see!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winner-header.jpg)

With the allure of adorable mascots and sweet, sweet prizes on the line, the artists of the osu! community put pen to paper (or to tablet, as it were) to draw said adorable mascots enjoying a decidedly different spring experience.

The results have been most impressive, to say the least! The theme was a bit of a curve-ball for most, given that we've never really done anything like this in the past four or so years that the fanart contests have been running.

Still, our glorious artists did not fail to deliver, and without further ado, allow me to present to you the finalists you all voted for.

Remember, *clicking the small banner will take you to a full-quality version of the artwork if you want to save it!*

In first place with **3495** votes reigns [**TofuMang**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4817223)'s wonderful take on a pyjama-donned pippi losing horribly to Chirou in the freshly-patented-please-do-not-steal card game known as uso!.

We didn't think teashades would work on pippi, but when you have as much talent as TofuMang clearly does, they apparently do!

Nipping on first place's heels throughout the whole contest and ending up with **3477** votes, [**xxxxxx2800**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4084853) very nearly stole the show entirely with his stunningly vibrant rendition of pippi viewing cherry blossoms from the safety of her home.

At one point, three votes separated first and second place. We've genuinely never seen margins so slim in the voting run before. One look at the piece explains why quite well!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/snowyani2000.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/snowyani2000.png)

Esteemed fanart contest veteran [**snowyani2000**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2691590) made his presence known once again, with **3210** voters being curtly reminded to wash their filthy hands.

Meanwhile, an assortment of chibi mascots bound around on pippi's bed while she presumably pays off some kind of interest-free home loan on the video game she's playing.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/Shuuzo.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/Shuuzo.png)

**2961** voters succumbed to pippi's Absolute Territory conjured forth by [**Shuuzo**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3661521)'s artistic mettle. Bored as she looks with watching a live stream of cherry blossom trees, we all know who the real flower was in this piece.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/thomashuckle.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/thomashuckle.png)

**2836** said yes to [**thomashuckle**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14471273)'s take on a very comfortable pippi and Mocha enjoying some time in front of the sun.

Floral motifs are always big in Spring pieces, but this one nailed it extra hard, in this humble author's opinion.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/10nya.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/10nya.png)

**2823** voters cast their approval like petals in the wind for [**10nya**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/678794)'s rendition of a schoolgirl pippi gazing out upon a blossoming cherry tree.

Ah, the days of peace and quiet. Before Yuzu showed up.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/Sjao.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/Sjao.png)

Inked in some of the finest colouring work we've seen in a fanart contest so far, **2693** voters cast their eye towards [**Sjao**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7295733)'s Mocha attired in an airy dress as she admires her yard from her window.

The vibrancy and tone work in this piece is just absolutely stunning, as is the attention to shadows and the particulars of light all around. Fantastic stuff!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/Hecatia.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/Hecatia.png)

**2470** voters joined [**Hecatia**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8244635)'s pippi for some socially-distanced boba set to the gentle tones of sunset.

We unofficially titled this piece as 'the Last Straw'. You will let her have the last straw, right?

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/157.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/157.png)

**2403** voters understood that M is for Mocha (and for midriff) in [**157**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9315038)'s take on our most adorable mascot lazing around in a storm of sunlit petals.

The hoodie she is wearing is *clearly* an official osu! hoodie. No word yet on when official osu! thigh highs will join the merch ensemble.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/Aoki%20chiaki.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/Aoki%20chiaki.png)

**2160** people snuck a sneak peek into Chirou's room as imagined by [**Aoki chiaki**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7692958), and were gobsmacked by its cleanliness and botanical theme.

That, and the tiny mask-wearing catgirl chibi pippi that has claimed her computer chair.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/Phillette.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/Phillette.png)

**1940** voters watched along with Mocha as she gazes upon pippi's feeble attempts to conquer the ancestor of her most beloved game mode, courtesy of [**Phillette**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9457944)'s artistic skills.

We presume Mocha is also snacking on what looks to be green tea pocky in the process. The old saying "you are what you eat" takes on a different meaning when you realize that both said pocky and Mocha's hair share the same colour. Hmm.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/HEKUSODASU.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/HEKUSODASU.png)

[**HEKUSODASU**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9044692) drew **1901** tiny chibi pippis doing tiny chibi pippi things. Oh, and that many people voted for the entry as well.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/Eternity%20Youmu.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/Eternity%20Youmu.png)

In perhaps the most sombre take of all the entries thus far, [**Eternity Youmu**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1012268)'s take on an unfortunately feverish pippi drew sympathy from the hearts of **1765** voters.

Get well soon!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/VoidSynatic.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/VoidSynatic.png)

**1765** people snickered at how bad Mocha is at card games, courtesy of [**VoidSynatic**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8270353)'s rendition of Aiko profoundly rolling her in a game of Old Maid.

That don is up to something...

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/Dreamxiety.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/Dreamxiety.png)

**1763** curious butterflies flitted past [**Dreamxiety**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233)'s pippi studying the art of osu! in book form within a library.

We like to think this is what the inside of the Community Mentorship server looks like.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/ShovelKun.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/ShovelKun.png)

**1505** voters were convinced to stay home by [**ShovelKun**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9948284)'s fashionably spring-attired Maria. Simple, clean, and an absolute pleasure to look at.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/kuroshi-n.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/kuroshi-n.png)

When **1456** people saw [**kuroshi-n**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9887975)'s Yuzu smile, they had no choice but to press the button.

With the assistance of some feline friends, our most hyperactive mascot seems to be faring the tribulations of quarantine rather well, though we suspect his room will be filled to capacity with paper cranes by the time it ends.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/Amy-chan.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/Amy-chan.png)

**1430** voters found [**Amy-chan**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5213909)'s catgirl pippi very relatable as she feasts upon a bag of Nom brand potato snacks, lounging on a couch.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/iegno.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/iegno.png)

Not to be left out of snacking time, **1363** people approved of [**iegno**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7736026)'s Mocha enjoying some snacks of her own, and probably running around smacking people in the head with bug nets within an unnamed game of choice involving animals and crossings.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/banners/rukanyaaan.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/92/winners/rukanyaaan.png)

**1353** joined [**rukanyaaan**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16690734)'s pippi and Chirou in realizing that there's (probably) no rules about standing inside and looking at your yard with the door open.
