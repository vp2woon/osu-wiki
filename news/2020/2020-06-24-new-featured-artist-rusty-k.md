We're proud to welcome **Rusty K** aboard as our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/87/header.jpg)

Spinning electronic music marvels since 2012, [**Rusty K**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/87) is a Russian producer most well known in osu! from [Mir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8688812) and [C00L](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4930630)'s vanguard maps set to *All That We Lost*, *Dark Eyes* and *Last Of Us* back in 2017 focusing on the exploration of a then-emerging subgenre of 'technical' mapping.

We're super excited to unveil a selection of **14** tracks, including the timeless classics listed above. We're hoping that this new collection inspires more mappers to pick up the torch and continue experimenting with style and sound.

Don't just take our word for it though, give these previews a listen and see for yourself:

You all should know the drill by now - all of the above plus a whole bunch more are available this very moment over at [**Rusty K's Featured Artist listing**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/87), all pre-timed and just waiting for you to be cool like Mir and C00L and map them.

Emboldened by your collective ribbing from last week's uh, 'not so challenging' hint, the fabled Hintern set a challenge most grand last Monday for this release with the ominous hint of merely 'feo19'.

Many guessed but only a few were truly correct, with tweeter @Lukaico taking top prize in deciphering that 'feo' referred to iron oxide (a type of *rust*) and 19 referred to the atomic number of potassium, which goes by the letter *K* on the periodic table. A few trailing guesses arrived on the mark afterwards from @REFORMEDawnsday, @AJT_main and @DeityPorg as well.

We've had so many Featured Artists in the last year or so that I'm running out of ways to allude to us having even more of them without just repeating myself. Rest assured, the train will continue on with its weekly stops well into the future, and if you dig the hint game or just want to keep on top of the news for all things osu!, make sure to check out the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) throughout the week for more details.
