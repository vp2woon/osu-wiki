We're proud to welcome **Sound Souler** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/70/header.jpg)

Featuring on projects from *Team Arcstar* and *Milkyway TRAXX*, you might be already be familiar with **Sound Souler** from titles like *Muse Dash*, *Arcaea* and *OverRapid*. Suffice to say, he knows rhythm game music well, and we're excited to see what creations the osu! community will undertake with his sound. We've managed to snag **19** stonking tracks for your mapping experiments too, so there's plenty of things to choose from.

The Mappers' Guild have been hard at work creating fancy preview sets showcasing the kind of magnificence you can get up to with his varied, electronica-styled sound, so make sure to check them out to get a feel for things. You can find them linked below, and I *highly* recommend checking them out.

Here's a brief preview of what's available:

All of the above plus so much more are available right now over at [**Sound Souler**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/70), so head on over and sink your teeth in. As is the usual with these things, everything you see over there is 100% cleared for use in mapping, so worry less and map mmore!

The self-appointed CEO of the "Kalibe Appreciation Team" (aka Twitter user iljaaz) correctly nabbed this week's relatively simple hint with room to spare. Honourable mentions go to Umbre for their guess of Pendulum (citing Hold Your Colour). And there was something about Dragonforce too, I guess. As usual.

New week, new artist, you know the drill. Stay tuned to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for mid-week hints and other important announcements. There's some other not-FA related stuff slated for this week that you'll probably want to listen out for if mapping is your thing!
