We're proud to welcome **Morimori Atsushi** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/108/header.jpg)

The much-adored creator of a number of highly popular osu! tracks, **Morimori Atsushi** is a Japanese composer and star DJ in the making, most well known for his large library of rhythm gaming hits, including tracks like *Txxs or get the fxxk out!!* and *PUPA*, the former being a very popular feature during the osu! World Cup 2018 group stages.

We're excited to announce that we have not ten, not twenty, but **38** new tracks from him now available, including classics like the above, plus a whole bunch more.

No showcase maps this time around, but never fear, the community well and truly has us covered on this one.

All of the above plus so many more are available right now from [**Morimori Atsushi**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/108), timed for your convenience and 100% ready for your mapping mettle. Newbies to the craft should definitely check him out!

As an extra note, during the licensing process, we were informed that a few tracks present in user submissions were subject to exclusive usage agreements geared towards other projects, which means that the artist unfortunately did not have the rights to re-license those tracks with us.

At his request, we've removed said tracks as per our [copyright policy](https://osu.ppy.sh/legal/copyright), and would like to remind mappers to ensure that they have all the appropriate usage rights when uploading beatmaps. All tracks on any Featured Artist listing are *always* totally safe to use in osu!, so those who start working with FA tracks have absolutely nothing to worry about in this regard.

We're still going strong with this two-a-week release shenanigans, and a cursory look at our schedule shows it continuing well into 2021. Crazy stuff. Keep tabs on everything new and exciting osu! wise over at the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) - be that one guy in every Discord server who has the details first.

Make sure to check back on Saturday for another awesome artist!
