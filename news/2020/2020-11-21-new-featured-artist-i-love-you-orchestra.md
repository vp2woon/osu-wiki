Give a heavy welcome to **I love you Orchestra**, our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/117/header.jpg)

Straying *just a bit* from your standard orchestra, **I love you Orchestra** is a Japanese instrumental rock band built from a pair of drummers, a pair of guitarists, and the bassist from the metal band *KAGERO*.

We've managed to round up **9** head-bangable tracks from the band's *Trigger* album, all available from their [Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/117).

Curious how they translate to mapping? Thanks to [Mirash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2841009), [Leader](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/631530), and [Hinsvar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1249323) of the [Mappers' Guild](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild), you can test out the full range of the 1 to 7 star spectrum in the showcase mapset below!

Open your ears to some samples of their work:
