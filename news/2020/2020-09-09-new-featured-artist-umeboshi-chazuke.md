We're proud to welcome **Umeboshi Chazuke** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/98/header.jpg)

Not to be confused with the savory and sometimes sour Japanese foodstuff of the same name, our **Umeboshi Chazuke** is the chiptune artist renowned across the rhythm game music scene for his high-energy, super sweet sound. His work has featured in staples like the *SOUND VOLTEX* games and even Rayark's aesthetic masterpiece *VOEZ*.

We've managed to snag **9** tracks encompassing well-loved classics like *Bison Charge* and *Panic! Pop'n! Picnic!*, plus a whole bunch of new picks that we think you'll love.

Check it all out:

All of the above plus a few more can be found over at the candy store that is [**Umeboshi Chazuke**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/98), all pre-timed and quite literally waiting for you to map them. Go on, you know you want to.

Lots of people picked out this week's hint! Not too surprising given how popular **Umeboshi Chazuke** is, but in any case, tweeters @cyndrean, @OsuBeard, @AwokenFS, @Leebs\_\_, @clefie, @Rentra_, @aeima17, @MeritOnOsu and @kanocchi\_\_ nailed it. Special points go to @cyndrean and @OsuBeard who *explained* the hint in full. Real Beatmap Nominator material, these two.

We march ever closer on to the completely arbitrary (but still impressive) milestone of 100 Featured Artists, just a paltry two weeks away. Crazy to think about just how much the project has grown in these past two years — spare a thought for your local neighborhood pishifat, who as always, continues to go absolutely hog wild with his outreach efforts.

Keep in the know by following the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for more tidbits and details, and until next week, enjoy! Oh, and if you missed it, [we've updated a whole bunch of existing Featured Artists with new tracks too](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-09-04-new-featured-artist-updates-september-2020), so make sure to check that out if you haven't already.
