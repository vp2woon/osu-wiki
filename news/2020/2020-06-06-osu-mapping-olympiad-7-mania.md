Hello everyone and welcome to the second osu!mania edition of the Mapping Olympiad, where we decided to go back with an old school format!

The first Mania edition of the Mapping Olympiad was won by [PianoLuigi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9665915), who managed to charm all the judges with his entry! Will you be next?

Enough talk, let's jump into action!

## Rules

- This contest is for the **osu!mania** mode only. **4K** and **7K** are the only keymodes you can map.
- Each entry must follow the **[ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)**. Entries found to break the ranking criteria will be subject to penalties, ranging from point deductions to disqualification based on severity.
- Beatmap submissions must **not** exceed 15MB.
- Storyboards will **not** be considered in the judging process.
- Custom hitsounds **may** be used.
- Collaboration on entries is **not** permitted.
- Maps submitted to the contest must **not** be uploaded using the Beatmap Submission System (BSS) until the contest is concluded and the winners are announced.

As an additional requirements for this contest edition, we wanted to go back to the basics, by asking you to do **a full mapset** of the song you want. This requires you to map a **Normal**, **Hard**, and **Insane** difficulty at the minimum, with **Easy** and **Expert** being the only optional difficulties.

Please note that you can only map **one song per keymode**, which means you can submit an entry in both **4K** and/or **7K**.

## Judging Criteria

For each eligible submitted difficulty, the judging panel will award points based on the following criteria:

- **Rankability (15 pts):** How well the entry respects the ranking criteria; unrankables or concepts that aren't allowed by the ranking criteria will make you lose points. The quality of the difficulty spread will be judged under this criteria.
- **Song Interpretation (20 pts):** How well the entry follows the outline of the song through rhythm choices, emphasis, and patterns.
- **Originality (15 pts):** How unique and interesting the concepts and themes used are.
- **Hitsounding (5 pts):** How good and detailed the hitsounding is.
- **Judge Impression (10 pts):** The judge's overall impression. How they view the effectiveness of the entry in its entirety.

## Prizes

After all valid entries are judged and the results are finalized, the top three entrants for each keymode will receive the following prizes:

- **1st place**: 4 months of osu!supporter, 6 Olympiad points (awards *Mapping Olympian* badge), *Elite Mapper* title, and a quick ranking process granted by [Unpredictable](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7560872) and [Kamuy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7439226)
- **2nd place**: 3 months of osu!supporter and 4 Olympiad points
- **3rd place**: 2 months of osu!supporter and 2 Olympiad points

Olympiad contests utilise a points-based system to award the *Mapping Olympian* badge. Even if you do not win a particular contest, achieving a podium placement in multiple contests can result in the award of a badge. Every 6 points earned will grant a badge level, with incrementation on the badge for each level achieved.
