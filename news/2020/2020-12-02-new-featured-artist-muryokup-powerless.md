Atmospheric vocaloid rock expert and top tier rhythm game song producer [**MuryokuP / Powerless**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/120) is an artist beyond introductions. Their heavy percussive and piano-driven sound is practically a staple for the osu! experience at this point, given their wide collection of ranked beatmaps that have withstood the test of time.

We've snagged **22** tracks from both their **MuryokuP** and **Powerless** aliases, ranging from their heavier rock songs to their modern electronic masterpieces. With a sound perfect for osu!, we're sure you'll love what you hear from them.
