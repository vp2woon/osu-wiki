In [this installment of the Mapping Olympiad contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/90), the community was tasked with creating two osu!catch difficulties for [*MYLK*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/62)'s Waffle Wave. One of the two difficulties was required to be of a lower playing skill level (Easy, Normal or Hard), with the other being for players of a higher skill level (Insane or Expert). The results can be seen below:

Edging past the competition and securing **first place** is [**alienflybot**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114) with a total score of **177**! alienflybot's experience shone through in the execution and enjoyability of their Platter and Rain difficulties, topping the judges scorecards for the Technique and Impression categories. Their entry also came in second by merely a whisker in the Musical Relevance and Hitsounding categories, and was judge Sc4v4nger's favourite pick. Congratulations to a veteran mapper of over five years on joining the ranks of osu!'s Elite Mappers at last!

Not quite able to replicate their winning ways from the inaugural osu!catch Mapping Olympiad contest, [**Sinnoh**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4236057) nevertheless claims an impressive **second place** with a total score of **174**! Falling only a little short of the winning formula, Sinnoh once again put in a strong performance in all categories, comfortably rated the highest for Creativity amongst our judges, and narrowly claimed the highest total score from judge Greaper with their Platter and Overdose difficulties.

Fighting off nail-bitingly fierce competition in **third place** is [**Yumeno Himiko**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1806962) with a total score of **162.5**! Yumeno Himiko performed solidly in all categories, but it was a winning score in the Hitsounding category that edged their entry of Salad and Rain difficulties into the final podium place.
