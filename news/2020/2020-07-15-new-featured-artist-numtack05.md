**Numtack05** joins the lineup as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/90/header.jpg)

Making waves in the Vocaloid scene for years with his unique take on instrumentation and composition, **Numtack05** (also known as *Putin-P* and *Teihen-P*) is a Japanese composer and producer who has been gaining attention in the osu! community as of late.

Avid Vocaloid mappers like [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323) have been hard at work bringing his creations to life in beatmap form, and we're excited to announce that a selection of his works are now officially nestled under the Featured Artist banner.

**15** tracks from across his sprawling discography are now available, complete with a new showcase map from the ever-talented Mappers' Guild.

You've heard this so many times by now, but as is the usual, all of the above plus a whole bunch more are available from [**Numtack05's Featured Artist listing**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/90), all pre-timed and awaiting your foray into his eclectic sound.

Nobody got even close to this week's hint, but there were some good attempts. Illusion referred to the 'genkaku' in Genkaku Catastrophe, whilst ruin refers to 'catastrophe', and the fifth mentioned in the hint pays homage to the 05 in **Numtack05**. Better luck next week!

The hint game is a bit of a twofold thing - even when nobody guesses it for the week, it tells us a lot about what artists are on people's minds and gives *us* hints as to where we should be steering things next.

That's all for this week, but we're still well on our way to the big, completely arbitrary 100 artist milestone with **Numtack05** being number 90. Insane stuff if you think about it for long enough! Keep on top of all things osu! by following the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/), and we'll see you this time next week for another artist reveal!
