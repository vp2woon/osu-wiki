Yes, you read that right. **185** intrepid artists took to penning our mascots surviving (or thriving) during the quandries of quarantine, and it is time to choose the best from among them!

A selection of the top-voted entries will be featured as the Spring Seasonal background pack for 2020, including appearing on a main menu near you.

Check out a quick preview video of all the entries before you dig in, set to the tunes of *MAPLE ADVENTURE* from our very own [**dark cat**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/6):
