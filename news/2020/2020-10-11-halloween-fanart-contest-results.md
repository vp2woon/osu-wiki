The results for our **biggest ever** fanart contest are in, and we've got **15** new spooky pieces coming to a main menu near you!

With over 210 pieces in the running and only 20 votes to go around, the competition this year was fiercer than ever. Thank you to those who endured the nigh impossible task of doling out all their entries, you made this year's contest possible!

That being said, every contest must have its winners, and it is now time to announce ours! Just as a reminder, the top 5 finalists as voted by you will receive a fancy profile badge featuring the winning work, and all finalists will receive **3 months of osu!supporter** as well as having their artwork featured in the main menu as our Halloween 2020 seasonal backgrounds.

Now, on to the winners:

*Note: you can click the banners for each entry to see a high-quality version of the piece, and you can download a zip file containing all of them [here](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/Halloween2020Finalists.zip)!*

Solidly securing the lead all throughout the voting with a whopping **3518** votes, [**CupcakeCrazier**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12063010)'s rendition of a spooky starlit vista featuring a pumpkin witch pippi, Alice in Wonderland Mocha and Chirou as an adorable cat-thing is one of the most notably Halloween-themed entries this humble author has seen to date.

Truly deserving of first place, well done!

Sporting a fierce wild cat Mocha and a (fiercely) embarrassed witch pippi [**RianneRyan**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17165886)'s entry won the hearts of **3280** voters with a very emotive performance all round.

**3250** voters were clawing at the fence just like [**SJPumpkin**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4840900)'s take on a very undead pippi shambling forth to eat your brains. Rumor has it that this is the fate of all those whose beatmap diet consists solely of farm maps. True terror!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/banners/tsuqie.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/winners/tsuqie.png)

[**tsuqie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16877867)'s enchanting shot of pippi and Mocha working suspiciously orange magic and alchemy above the clouds captivated **3106** voters, complete with some spooky floating pumpkins to boot.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/banners/risuuna.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/winners/risuuna.png)

Showcasing a most devilish Aiko and a most bountiful pippi during a foggy night under the stars, [**risuuna**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7266506) scored **3020** votes overall. Did you spot the hidden hitcircle pumpkin?

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/banners/trashvevo.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/winners/trashvevo.png)

Bat wings and frills abound in [**trashvevo**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7339730)'s take on a beautifully attired Halloween pippi taking to the firework-lit skies under a full moon, enthralling **2972** under her wicked spell.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/banners/Azocat.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/winners/Azocat.png)

[**Azocat**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11596939)'s depiction of pippi and Chirou prowling the streets for precious candy earned the approval of **2899** voters - but wait, what's that mysterious cat tailing them in the background?

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/banners/Lee%20Narie.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/winners/Lee%20Narie.png)

Mani and Mari make their first finalist fanart appearance in [**Lee Narie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2667849)'s take on a reaper and witch respectively, snagging **2862** votes.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/banners/Dreamxiety.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/winners/Dreamxiety.png)

Fanart contest regular [**Dreamxiety**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233) returns again for Halloween with an elaborately costumed pippi gazing out across a most spooky vista. **2381** glowing pumpkins appreciated their cameo!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/banners/xxxxxx2800.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/winners/xxxxxx2800.png)

[**xxxxxx2800**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4084853)'s piece of a witch pippi observing a game of life and death (no seagulls crying in this one) earned **2323** votes from fellow observers. The blue one looks a bit suspicious if you ask me...

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/banners/Huckle.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/winners/Huckle.png)

[**Huckle**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14471273)'s pastel Halloween piece scored **2322** votes from fellow palette appreciators. Seriously, the colour on this one is just wonderful.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/banners/D0tz_.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/winners/D0tz_.png)

**2289** voters meekly yielded their stars to [**D0tz_**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6841570)'s take on a smug, lounging vampire pippi. Don't look at the portrait on the shelf, rumor has it that those who do are never able to pass on from the osu! life...

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/banners/Sjao.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/winners/Sjao.png)

Returning finalist [**Sjao**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7295733) impresses yet again with a fantastically sanguine piece showcasing Mani and Mari in attire most gothic, complete with headstones and swirls of crimson. **2145** voters were firmly enchanted by this entry, and it's hardly surprising!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/banners/HEKUSODASU.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/winners/HEKUSODASU.png)

[**HEKUSODASU**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9044692) dove straight into the cute and chibi with their entry this year, scoring **1894** votes for a highly stylized take on Mani and Mari handing out candy to intrepid trick-or-treaters. Unfortunately for Mani, it appears that *he* is the candy for some.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/banners/McFriedFries.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/winners/McFriedFries.png)

[**McFriedFries**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12694139)'s beautifully painted piece of pippi and Mocha poised in costume before their rightfully-earned hoard of candy achieved **1878** votes total. Always wonderful to see more styles in the mix!

Congratulations once again to all the finalists, and a HUGE thank you to everyone who entered! This was quite literally our biggest fanart contest ever by a fairly big margin, and the entries showcased above will have made their way onto your main menu by the time you read this post, unless you're from the future. In which case, don't spoil the big contest we're about to hold in a few weeks time!

Make sure you check out the [Halloween 2020 Fanart Contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/112) to see where the other entries placed - there were just so many good ones that didn't quite make the final cutoff, and their artists deserve your support! If we could take them all, we would, we promise.

Just in case you missed it above, you can download a high quality collection of all the finalists [here](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/112/Halloween2020Finalists.zip). If you're after a piece that wasn't featured here, make sure to contact the artist and ask them! You'll probably make their day in the process.

We'll see you again in a month or so for the final fanart contest to cap off the year!
