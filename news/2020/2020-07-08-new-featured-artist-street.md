We're proud to welcome **Street** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/89/header.jpg)

Hailing from Japan, [**Street**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/89) is a Japanese electronic music producer and avid rhythm game music competitor. If you've ever played *SEVEN'S CODE*, *Arcaea* or paid any attention to the *BMS OF FIGHTERS* contests before, you've likely already heard some of **Street**'s work!

His tracks [*Sakura Fubuki*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/362989) and [*Maritime Police*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/681410) have garnered considerable fame in both bygone times and the more modern era, and we're absolutely certain that his enchanting sound will lure in more people to the creative challenge of his tracks.

We've managed to snag **15** assorted tracks from his discography for you to test your mettle on. The Mappers' Guild have also been hard at work being ahead of the curve (as usual), so there's two new maps for you to try out as well.

Check it all out:

As per the usual, all of the above plus a whole bunch more are available right now over at [**Street's Featured Artist listing**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/89), all pre-timed and ready for your creative touch.

The Hintern claims partial victory once again, with only one avid tweeter by the name of @Nyroux successfully deciphering this week's hint. Tagetes refers to the scientific name for a species of marigold flower, while 'at sea' refers to maritime - where the top difficulty name for Mir's Maritime Police is in fact, "Marigold". A downpouring of flowers refers to 'sakura fubuki', which can be read to sound like a blizzard of sakura flowers. The M2U guesses were close, but all of a hint is important, not just a singular word!

It is super exciting to begin folding in some more incredible talent for the Japanese music scene, and it is a trend that I think we'll all be glad to see continue in the coming months and years. Keep your eyes peeled on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) for any upcoming hints for next week's release, plus more news pertinent to your circle clicking adventures.
