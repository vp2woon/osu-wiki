We're proud to welcome the critically acclaimed progressive metal act **Ne Obliviscaris** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

Turning heads among the top echelon beatmapping and player community since [mithew](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2571893)'s highly vaunted creation set to [*Painters of the Tempest (Part II): Triptych Lux*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/724192/#osu/1529189) during early 2018, [**Ne Obliviscaris**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/86) is an Australian metal band making huge waves in the scene since 2003 with their unique blend of progressive and extreme metal.

Continuing a trend among tried and true players, **Ne Obliviscaris** joins the likes of **Æther Realm** and **Rivers of Nihil** as some of the community's most widely adored metal acts. We're proud to support this longstanding tradition with a cursory addition of **15** new tracks from these insanely talented shredders, including ones you know and love.

In addition, the Mappers' Guild has been hard at work charting another ten minute long masterpiece to stand with those who dare to delve into the tempest, and we're excited to share it with you today.

Give them a listen and see for yourself:

All of the above plus so much more are available right now over at [**Ne Obliviscaris**' Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/86), pre-timed and well prepared for your creative enterprises. Even though there's only slightly over a dozen new tracks, this represents nearly three hours of original music to sink your teeth into, so what're you waiting for?

As one astute tweeter pointed out, this week's hint was something more of an early notification more than an actual puzzle to solve given how wildly popular **Ne Obliviscaris** is among the playerbase. Consider this a drill for future widely-adored acts when they join the roster!

We'll be back next week with more incredible talent for the creative among us to test their mapping mettle on, so make sure you stay tuned and keep on top of things by paying attention to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/). The train just never stops, seriously.
