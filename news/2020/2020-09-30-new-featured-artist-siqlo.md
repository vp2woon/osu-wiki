**siqlo** joins the lineup as our latest addition to the Featured Artist roster!

If you've ever played any recently released rhythm game in the past few years, you've likely come across some of **siqlo**'s work before! His work has featured in games like *VOEZ*, *SOUND VOLTEX*, *Arcaea*, *MUSE DASH* and more - hardly surprising once you hear some of it.

We're excited to announce that we've managed to score **13** tracks from across **siqlo**'s body of work, including well-loved classics like *Forest Haze* and the BMS sensation *One Way Street*.

The ever-talented Mappers' Guild has really been extra hard at work this time around, with a whopping **4** new showcase maps to help welcome **siqlo**'s sound into a more modern age of mapping, because we all know that 2015 is basically ancient history at this point.

Check out a sample of what's available below:

You know the drill, if you like what you hear, head on over to [**siqlo**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/102) to download the pre-timed mapping files and get straight into making your next creation. Your map could be the next big thing!

That's all for now, but make sure to keep tabs on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for more stuff you probably want to know, and check back on Saturday for yet another stonking new addition to the Featured Artist roster.

See you then!
