## How do I register?

- **[Click here to sign-up!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/23)**
- Do not create teams in advance! Teams will be formed by each country's team captain after the Registration Phase has concluded.
- Submit your registration before the **15th of February.**

Please note: you may only participate if your **osu!taiko Global Ranking is #5000 or higher, and have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months**.

If your registration successfully passes our evaluation, you will be placed onto the candidate list for your country. Whenever a captain for your country has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

*Remember that any registrations submitted after the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances — submit your registration ahead of schedule to avoid any last-minute issues.*
