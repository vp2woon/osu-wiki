We're proud to announce **MYUKKE.** as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/121/header.jpg)

A master of cutting and re-arranging vocals with a fast paced rhythm-game vibe, [**MYUKKE.**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/121) is a Japanese producer with a purely unique sound. His works have found their way into plenty of other games throughout the years like *SOUND VOLTEX*, *Cytus II*, and *Arcaea*, earning his iconic songs a massive audience!

We've grabbed hold of **20** high energy tracks for his Featured Artist listing, all of which we're sure you'll love.

How does **MYUKKE.**'s music convert to mapping? The Mappers' Guild can show you how it's done with their collab mapset for [*BUNA☆SYNERGY!!!*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1294640) hosted by [Realazy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/918297). See the combination of music and mapping mastery in the preview below.
