We went for something a little different this summer with the theme park bit, and our amazingly talented community artists have not disappointed with their performance!

Head into the crowds today and pick out your favourite **10** entries to help us decide who's the best of the best. A selection of the top-voted winners will make it to the main menu as the Summer 2020 seasonal backgrounds, snagging their artists a bunch of osu!supporter and profile badge prizes in the process.

To make things a little easier, we've prepared a brief preview video showcasing what's up for voting, all set to the tunes of [**Hyper Potions'**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/85) track *Surf*:
