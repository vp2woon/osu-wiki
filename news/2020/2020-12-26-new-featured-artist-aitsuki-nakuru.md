We're proud to introduce renowned vocalist **Aitsuki Nakuru** as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/127/header.jpg)

The voice behind a number of immensely popular beatmaps is here to make her mark! **Aitsuki Nakuru** is a Japanese singer and voice actress well known for both her delightfully upbeat and emotionally dramatic performances. Since forming one half of the group *Endorfin.* in 2015, she's diversified into producing doujin circle works, songs for music games, theme songs, and her own set of original music!

Being practically a household name on osu! at this point through her contributions to our other Featured Artists like [Trial & Error](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/20), [Imy](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/99), and [Jun Kuroda](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/124), we're more than glad to provide her a home in her own personalized Featured Artist listing!

**17** tracks in collaboration with 9 other musicians are waiting at your doorstep ready to be mapped! These include a few songs you might be familiar with like *Monochrome Butterfly* and *Presenter\**, plus a huge catalog of others that are surely worth your while!

[**Aitsuki Nakuru**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/127) has everything above and more, all set up with pre-timed beatmap templates ready for you to start mapping! We can't tell you how disappointed we'll be if each of these songs doesn't have a full mapset ranked by the end of the year.

Speaking of the end, that's it for Featured Artists in 2020! We'll be back at the top of the new year with some updates to our current Featured Artists, then we'll jump into the two-artists-a-week schedule again.

It's honestly insane how much growth we've had this year. We've more than doubled the amount of artists in the Featured Artist program since January and we'll try to run at the same pace throughout 2021.

Thank you to the many mappers who've been contributing by mapping Featured Artist songs. Everything about the Featured Artist program is worth it because of what you create.

:)
