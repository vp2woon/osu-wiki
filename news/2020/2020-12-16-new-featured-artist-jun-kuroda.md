We're proud to welcome **Jun Kuroda** to the Featured Artist roster!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-12-16-new-featured-artist-jun-kuroda/jun-kuroda-header.png)

Combining jazz, electro, and rock together to form his own unparalleled body of work, **Jun Kuroda** is a Japanese producer whose music penetrates the borders of genre. Most may recognize him for his rhythm-game-esque sound found throughout *pop'n music* and *SOUND VOLTEX* arcade cabinets, yet his contributions are also noteworthy elsewhere, such as his composition on VTuber music through *USAGI Production*.

Given the choice of **20** new tracks available from [**Jun Kuroda**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/124), including stellar performances from familiar vocalists like *Aitsuki Nakuru*, *Oshima Haruna*, and *setsunann*, we're more than confident that you'll find something to your liking.

On the mapping front, we decided to feature not one, but *ten* mappers through a silly blind-collaborative map for [Jun Kuroda - Anokumene](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1324579). The map is undoubtedly a mess, but it'll give you a taste of what can be done with these songs!
