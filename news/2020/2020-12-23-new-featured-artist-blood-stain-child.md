**BLOOD STAIN CHILD** bursts their way into the Featured Artist lineup!

It's hard to believe mixing electro trance music with melodic death metal is even possible, yet [**BLOOD STAIN CHILD**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/126) proves that it's a combo undeniably worth listening to. With over 20 years of experience under their belt and a worldwide touring career, this 5-piece band is a must-have addition to osu!'s artist roster.

We've managed to grasp **13** tracks from their *Epsilon* album, including the ever-popular song *MOON LIGHT WAVE*. Switching between male, female, screamed, and traditional vocals, we're confident at least one of these tracks will suit your fancy.

Some osu! players may already be familiar with **BLOOD STAIN CHILD** thanks to [Snepif](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/408088)'s mapset of [MOON LIGHT WAVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/296543). Well, at least [chaotic_turtle](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5563397) is familiar, as seen on his stream the other day:
