[LamazeP - Sakkyokusuru Nara Ima no Uchi!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/567753#osu) by [Mijn Aim Zuigt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4587487)\
150 BPM, 4:12 | 6.82★

What's the recipe for a perfect map? Nothing but a healthy combination of satisfying patterns and a catchy tune! This high-6-star map by Mijn Aim Zuigt was certainly made with that recipe, as it features super enjoyable alternating patterns at 150 BPM topped off with a catchy vocaloid song. The spacing and complexity of the patterns scale gradually throughout the map's four minutes—see if you can keep up!

[Team Grimoire vs. Laur - Grievous Lady](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/778719#osu) by [Feruver](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3135958) et al.\
210 BPM, 2:19 | 1.72★ – 7.58★

It says a lot when a mapset can have this many difficulties and still make its way to the Loved voting stage, because it proves just how uniquely high-quality this mapset is as a whole. Clocking in at sixteen total difficulties ranging from 1 to 7 stars, each map has a different style for you to enjoy. The song itself is 210 BPM and packed with intensity throughout its two minute duration, so despite the sheer amount of difficulties in this mapset, they're enjoyable enough for you to play through them all!

260 BPM, 3:23 | 9.00★, 10.00★

More high-star challenges are coming straight to the Loved category with this Settia mapset that has accrued over 600 favorites. The mapset features two super cleanly mapped difficulties, one at 9 stars and the other reaching exactly 10 stars in difficulty. With the song being 260 BPM and featuring three distinct choruses, it's up to you to be able to prove your skills on such uniquely energetic maps.

With over 2,200 favorites to its name, this mapset by Gologle features 9 difficulties between 2 and 6 stars. At 160 BPM, this mapset is super friendly for players of any skill to train their aim and precision skills on a catchy 3-minute nightcore song.

If you're a lover of gimmicks, you'll soon be a lover of this map, too. Mr HeliX has made yet another map that's filled with countless unique storyboard gimmicks that strived (and succeeded!) to keep gameplay interesting, from moving circles to changing— oh, what's the fun if I tell you? Check out this unique map for yourself and be surprised at this exploration of what's possible with storyboard gimmicks!

135 BPM, 4:44 | 4.78★

One of the most noteworthy parts of the anime *Jojo's Bizarre Adventure* is definitely its soundtrack, and it's all thanks to songs like these. While some of those songs are sadly on the shorter side, this one thankfully reaches nearly five minutes and has been fully mapped by a user named -Fusein-. With the map itself being high-4 stars in difficulty and having over 350 favorites, it should serve as a friendly challenge to players of all skill levels—and a reputable one at that!

120 BPM, 4:10 | 5.98★, 7.35★

Parachute is a user known to have many uniquely challenging maps, and this map is nothing close to an exception. Despite the map being 7 stars in difficulty, there are many features that make it stand out from the ordinary high star beatmap, and the unique approach rate of 8.6 is only one of them. The map is 200 BPM and features many uniquely structured aim patterns that are a super fun challenge to attempt. A lower difficulty exists by a user named Adlol for those of you looking for a more typical kind of map.

180 BPM, 7:36 | 9.66★, 9.79★, 10.17★

This mapset was in the Loved in the past, and after some adjustments, it's time for it to make a return to the category, this time featuring two old versions of the map. The map itself is astonishing in difficulty, surpassing 10 stars and being over 7 minutes in length. The BPM is at an alarmingly high 270, and to top it all off, there are streams... long streams. Seriously. And they're everywhere. This map is an ultimate test of one's streaming ability, and if you dare to tackle it, all I can say is good luck.

First of all, this map deserves some praise for collecting 154 favourites in a month. That's unprecedented in the history of osu!taiko. This map replicates the skills of a character named "Reiuji Utsuho" from the game *Touhou Chireiden \~ Subterranean Animism*. Rather than being specific... if you play it, you'll know what kind of beatmap it is! The quality and ideas are great; everything is new. The difficulty is a bit high, but the map is even worth a look in Auto. You have to play it!

まず、おめでとうございます、と言わせてください。154favを1か月で集めるというのはosu!taikoの歴史の中でも前人未踏でしょう！この譜面は、ゲーム「東方地霊殿　～ Subterranean Animism.」のステージ6に登場する「霊烏路 空」というキャラクターのスキルを再現した譜面です。具体的に言うよりも...プレイすればどんな譜面かわかるはずです！クオリティ、アイデア共に素晴らしく、全てが新しいでしょう。難易度は少し高めですが、一度Autoで見る価値さえある譜面です。ぜひプレイしてみてください！

*Cutting the music* is a popular map in the eastern side of the community made by the mappers nyanmi-1828 and kai53247, which features an unique swing-ish style with a slight usage of gimmicks and SV changes that are very comfortable both reading and gameplay-wise. Overall, it's a very engaging map to play. Given the fact this map is not that hard, we hope this map can please a large part of the community, as high skill isn't a requirement to try this map out. As such, I think it's an excellent and interesting choice for this month's Loved section.

Nofool has been very consistently putting out most of the quality SV maps we have nowadays, and so he became one of the names people talk about the most when the topic of SV maps arises. *Memme - Avalanche* is one of his most fun creations, with plethora of SV waves both in streams and 1/4+1/6 patterns, while also having an exquisite "Donkama-like" pattern on the middle that really proved difficult in TWC 2018 when it was selected as a Semifinals FreeMod pick. We look forward to this piece of TWC history getting really cool plays by the most experienced sightread players of our community!

The \[Platter\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [Wesley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2407265)*

Now this pick is something different from the usual "high AR I have to go fast woosh woosh" maps you will see. *Cotton-Eye Joe* was created by DPJ9fuegos, who you might know from way back as a low-AR Hidden player. Because they enjoyed playing Hidden on all sorts of maps, they created this map with the low approach rate (8) aspect in mind. But that is not the only thing that is considered unusual in the current meta, the circle size is also set to 6. Due to these unusual settings, you can't really afford to be sloppy with your movement, as this will quickly result in either one or multiple misses.

Now the unusual approach rate and circle size isn't the only thing this map has to offer. The sliders are mapped with a pretty high slider velocity, making the droplets go all over the place. Combined with the high circle size this creates some amazing sliders, which will require insane accuracy to be able to catch properly.

215 BPM, 5:31 | 6.20★\
*description written by [Sartan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4100941)*

Alright, so here we have a case of a "how has this map never reached ranked status" type of map (just look at its changelog!). Introducing Nitsches to the Loved section, here they provide us a very clean map that has developed over the course of about 2.5 years. Due to the many testplays and mods, Nitsches was able to accumulate some popularity on this map, along with its use in the first edition of AxS. Installation is not the most extreme of maps, but also definitely not the easiest; the map mostly consists of light jumping, but the long solo section will throw some fairly difficult streams screaming the 2015 meta your way. Players at the higher end of the skill spectrum would be able to play this map with Hidden or HardRock though.

Perhaps most importantly though: the song is a banger, and Nitsches really provided a fun to play map here. So check it out! And perhaps, if you like the map, give Nitsches a cozy lil' cuddle with those sweet ARMS of yours :3

For old fruit guys, CTB Darkness is one of the legends among all catch maps. This incredible map produced by CLSW, Louis Cyphre, Spectator, Kuzino, and ExGon in 2012 became a memory for an era, but it got deleted after Louis Cyphre decided to push the standard set to the Ranked section. Revived by DakkyChan, this map got several nerfs and remastered for top players to play. Not much to say, this map includes a hell lot of innovative patterns, and some feel fresh and new even to 2020 catch mapping. The unusual combined usage of hyperdashes and edge dashes will absolutely give you an experience like no other.

*description written by [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)*

If you grew up as a PC gamer like me, then you will likely find some nostalgia in this map. This medley by Brandon Blume includes covers of various themes from the *Duke Nukem* franchise. The mapper, Astreachan, is a very active mapper who didn't receive much attention yet. Sadly they gave up trying to rank this very nice map, so it is time to give this the exposure it deserves through Loved. The map itself is really well made. It is different than what most people are used to, as the patterns used are, despite their simplicity, rather unique. Yet nothing feels uncomfortable to play at all. Everything harmonizes together and the map has a great flow. While it is not such a difficult map, giving it a try is still worth it for everyone.

We have seen Jole upon this stage of Loved before, and this particular choice also had the chance to be seen on the ever-massive stage belonging to the osu!mania World Cup. It is, of course, the eurobeat party that is *Here I Go Again*. Following the usual style of Jole's eurobeat pieces, the file is full of slower and broken jumpstream and normal stream patterns in place as the file's buildup, which lead to a chorus where the single streams are longer and continuous, making the focus required much more intense for the more dynamic and exciting part of the song. This makes for an interesting and engaging experience, and allows for significant excitement every time the chart picks up in the choruses. Not only this, but with added rates, the straightforward-nature of the chart can be enjoyed by a vast array of players with varying skillets. It is ultimately an exciting eurobeat experience that finds itself a very comfortable spot in the Loved nominations.

270 BPM, 1:24 | \[4K\], 1.17★ – 6.30★

"VERY fast streams going at incredible hihg speed" is the theme, and *Palette GAMMA* is the game. With a selection of difficulties at 270 BPM, there is plenty of space for speed freaks of all ranks to duke it out. Guest difficulties by game rock and \[Crz\]Player (otherwise known as ATTang) close the gap for both the newest of players and oldest of veterans, providing the extreme and the easy. If you find the original Myriad difficulty too mean, Cadmium-113's polished Myriad may prove to be kinder, but at this level of speed, expect no less of a challenge at any level of difficulty you find yourself on.

*Palette GAMMA* looks to be fit as a classic speed staple in all cases, and is definitely worthy of enshrining as a chart for Loved.

192 BPM, 2:13 | \[4K\] 4.52★

Smooth, simple, and straightforward are all words that could be used to accurately describe the next nomination for osu!mania, *Second Run* by Zyph. The chart flows extremely well, using varying LN patterns that get denser as the chart moves forward, eventually turning into full on inverse, albeit with lighter patterning to compensate for the increased LN density. The simplicity and difficulty compensation make it a great lower-level long note chart, and can make it an extremely satisfying chart to try for high-tier accuracy plays on it. The chart proves to be competitive and capable of reaching out to many players, which has helped give it significant popularity and make it very fitting as a Loved nomination.

[Chroma - lost found melody](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1051052#mania) by [Ciel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1455309)\
151 BPM, 4:18 | \[4K\] 4.25★, \[4K\] 4.25★

Ciel has been a prominent figurehead in the community as a mapper of challenging and fun SV maps. With his SV maps appearing in the Finals round of MWC each year, it's no surprise that Ciel is making his way into Loved voting again, this time with *lost found melody*. Made for the 2019 Finals pool, and quickly becoming a staple for every high-end SV player, *lost found melody* is a map filled with unexpected twists and turns while still being accessible and enjoyable to learn. Unlike many high-end SV maps, this has comparatively simplistic rhythms, but it is still rather difficult to get a score with good accuracy.

The map does not waste any time before throwing complex SVs at the player, keeping them on their toes from the very beginning. It leads into more visually tricky SV patterns, including continuous light jumpstream scattered with teleports, speedups and slowdowns. Entering the second half, the map presents another gimmick: the gap after each downbeat in the 1/3 jack section is shrunken creating a near-illusion, which forces the player to focus immensely. This leads into a section of repeated rhythms and patterns, cyclical and gradually intensifying SVs, and ending with the infamous continuous speedup to 10x.

With all of this in mind, it's evident that Ciel put a lot of thought into this map, and its diversity and creativity in patterning and SV creates a classic SV map that many have enjoyed. As such, its nomination for Loved voting is undoubtedly well deserved.

174 BPM, 4:24 | \[7K\] 7.30★

Look! 7K is back! And we're kicking things up with a spicy technical hybrid pick. A collaboration between AncuL and Evening, *Valhalla* tests any player's ability to deal with bursts, trills, jacks, and finger independent trilling at 174 BPM, all of which are taken up a notch with the frequent use of LNs. What makes the chart notable is its quality and playing experience is how it is paced. The chart eases the player into low density but technical piano-pitch-relevant mapping which signifies the kind of chart they're getting into. A fair contrast between rolly and comfy versus technical and awkward is provided when the sections transition into each other, giving the chart its personality. Taking inspiration from O2-style ideas and merging it with more modern mapping solidifies this chart's quality and makes it worth putting up for the Loved voting.

121 BPM, 3:59 | \[7K\] 5.97★, \[7K\] 6.63★

A newcomer to Project Loved, quacalid4's *Lovely Icecream Princess Sweetie* provides two difficulties, both of which at their core are very dumpy in nature and deliver an emphasis on gameplay which has been upheld by the mild interest provided by some high ranking players. *Lovely!!* is practically a mild chordjack map at 121 BPM with some LN usages to spice up things from time to time, but the real deal in this set is the *Lovely??* difficulty, which starts to challenge the player's ability to read LNs of varying lengths. Some inversions and LN chord usages are used at times to mix up the pace of the map as well. With the fairly unique nature of the chart, this is something others should consider trying out for this Loved voting round.
