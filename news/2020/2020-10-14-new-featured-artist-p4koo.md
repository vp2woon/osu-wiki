Rhythm game music veteran **P4koo** joins the lineup as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/106/header.jpg)

If you consider yourself any sort of rhythm game connoisseur, chances are that you've played one of the many games **P4koo** has featured in - from titles like *EZ2AC (EZ2DJ)*, *O2Jam*, *SOUND VOLTEX*, *Dynamix*, *Muse Dash* and a whole bunch more.

We're excited to bring his unique twist on the classic rhythm game sound (you all know what it is) into the osu! community proper with an ample selection of **33** tracks from across his whole discography, including well-loved tracks already popular here like *Fly High* and *Crystal Illusion*.

On top of that, we've also got three brand new collaborative showcase maps from the masters over at the Mappers' Guild showcasing **P4koo**'s sound in a more modern osu! and osu!catch setting to boot.

Check it all out:

All of the above plus a whole ton more are available this very moment over at [**P4koo**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/106) pre-timed and eagerly awaiting your creative input. **P4koo** has also enjoyed an extensive lineage of featuring in beatmap contests as well, so you know this is good stuff!

In the spirit of spooky month, we'll be keeping the tradition of delivering frightfully talented artists alive twice a week for you all throughout October. And December too. And maybe January if we feel like it, who knows?

Check out the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for all the news you probably want to know, and we'll see you again on Saturday!
