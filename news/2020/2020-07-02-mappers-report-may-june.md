## Ranking Criteria Changes

As every month we keep you up to date with the changes to the Ranking Criteria. All rule and guideline changes are listed below and in addition you can see open proposals to give your feedback!

### All Modes

- **[Remove glossaries from RC pages](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1064466)**: The content of the glossaries will be put into separate wiki articles! This has already happened for the general Ranking Criteria and the osu! Ranking Criteria. The others will follow soon!
- **[Allow .ogg files as a main audio source](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1021547)**: Always struggle with getting your map uploaded because of too large file size? Then we have good news! You can now use .ogg audio files to save some space! Note that they still have to follow the regular kbit/s rules!

### osu!

- **[Intuitive Reverse Arrow Movement](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1033709?start=unread):** Reverse Arrows now have to point into the direction in which the slider ball moves after hitting it.
- **[Restrictions on "accelerating" sliders](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1060629?n=1):**  A small clarification that the slider path has to be visible at all times.
- **[Circle size](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1082308):** You asked for it and here it is! It's been a long time since there was a ranked map with a circle size higher than 7. Now we will hopefully see some more coming soon!

### osu!catch

- **[Dashes and higher-snapped dashes on Rain difficulties](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1033696):** This RC change defines the allowed snap for dashes on Rain difficulties. It also clarifies the definition of higher-snapped dashes which was a problem for almost half a year.

### osu!mania

- **[Chord usage at 1/4 pattern in normal difficulties](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1079778):** This change allows the usage of chords at the beginning of 1/4 patterns in Normal and 1/2 patterns in Easy difficulties. Before, you could only use chords to end a pattern.

## Open Ranking Criteria Proposals

There are various open Ranking Criteria proposals in the [forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/87). Many of them are listed in the last issue of the [Mappers' Report](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-05-11-mappers-report-april#ranking-criteria-changes), but we also have some new ones which you can find below!

For all modes:

- **[Discussion to fix Vetoes](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1068618)**
- **[Spoiler warning option in maps](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1083667)**

For osu!:

- **[Limit per-combo maximum in osu! to fix issues with osu!catch converts](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1071402)**

For osu!mania:

- **[Change chord guidelines in 4k normal/hard diffs](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1067554)**
- **[Redefine the "stream" terminology in mania RC](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1079647)**

## Within the Beatmap Nominators and NAT

The Beatmap Nominators never rest, the Beatmap Nominators never sleep. Just kidding, of course they do, they are humans, too. However, the group line-up is always changing! New people are coming, old are going away. This month was no exception!

## Mappers' Showcase

The Mappers' Showcase presents lesser-known mappers from every game mode. Since we bundled two issues in one post, we will feature two game modes this month.

Thanks to [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134) for the osu!catch selections and [Scotty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11085809) & [Unpredictable](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7560872) for the osu!mania selections!

### Phob (osu!catch)

Having recently breached the gates of the ranked section, **[Phob](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462)** is a new mapper that is currently having a decent breakout year so far. Although he's more known for being a skilled Hidden player, his mapping definitely deserves more recognition! He crafts his maps with brilliant relevance to the music showing such coherence in patterning, proving he clearly knows what he's doing!

His take on [Feint - Snake Eyes (feat. CoMa)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1034056#fruits/2162020) exemplifies the mapping spirit of clean and consistency-based maps, as throughout his difficulties, they were made of superb quality. For a relatively new mapper, this set is surely impressive!

Moreover, his breakcore map, [Lolipusher - why as soon as we become so close, we have to say goodbye?](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1135515#fruits/2437918) manifests that Phob can still stand out regardless of the song's complexity and genre, while still maintaining players' interest through solid patterning.

Phob also tends to favour mapping lower difficulties, especially Salads, so he is certainly a mapper with promise for the future. If any novice mappers are reading this and looking for inspiration, Phob is a great person to be looking at!

### dika312 (osu!catch)

A long-term mapper that has been crafting maps for almost 5 years, **[dika312](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/741613)** is someone that strives for an intuitive yet a very interesting mapping style that will keep you on the edge of your seat! Despite his long mapping experience, none of dika's works has reached the ranked section (yet!), and most of his maps are sadly unnoticed by the public.

A diamond in the rough are his maps such as [Kikuo - Neko no Shokutaku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/839016#fruits/1756467), in which he has demonstrated his virtuosity in movement and exquisite patterning to create a gratifying piece of art from such a lovely song. Another solid example would be his rendition of [MALVA. - Trane](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1010141#fruits/2114540), wherein he has shown his proficiency in varying platter-motion once again — making use of diverse flow and patterns, leaving a pleasurable experience and taste for both mappers and players.

Another of his great works that is worth mentioning would be his take on [KikuoHana - Nobore! Susume! Takai Tou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/545757#fruits/2084234), showcasing exceptional progression in style as the song intensifies, along with fine contrast in calmer sections. We hope to see more of dika's maps, and hopefully he can bear us good fruit in the ranked section someday!

### BringoBrango (osu!mania)

**[BringoBrango](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10274043)** is a Canadian mapper who's been in the mapping community for about 2-3 years now and has really made a name for himself since late 2019 with his creative innovations and unique takes on the songs he maps. His most popular mapset so far is [Iglooghost - Bug Thief](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/887787#mania/2033667), with his later creation set to [PSYQUI - Multitalents](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1024323#mania/2142612) being used in last year's osu!mania World Cup.

However, some of his other maps that haven't taken the spotlight unlike the other two, such as [acloudyskye - Alignment](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1031818#mania/2157673), which perfectly showcases what he's capable of and how to utilize certain aspects of a song to their advantage. The map showcases everything that BringoBrango learnt over the course of his mapping career, which turned out excellently as it features LN layering schemes, jacks, heavy use of repetition, utilizing 1/6 and 1/8 flams, and especially the amount of SVs that adds a lot more to the map than it originally had such as stutters, slowjams, speedups, and so much more that perfectly craft this map together into a complex, yet mesmerizing map for anyone that dares to give it a try.

Other maps of his that definitely deserve more of a spotlight are [cYsmix - Classic Pursuit](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/730295#mania/2235782), which features more LN layering schemes, SVs, inverses, and jacks, all of which hold up the map together beautifully.

Another map of his, [Husky - Sleepy Boi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/807991#mania/1695651) mainly focuses on jacks and SVs while emphasizing the song's focus on repetition to create a formidable challenge, providing a throwback to his older jacks-oriented mapping style in the process.

We hope to see more of his work in the future as he's definitely quite the anomaly in the mapping scene!

### Ticle (osu!mania)

Despite not being around for long, **[Ticle](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11602148)** has been able to develop an explosive style of LN mapping. Their takes on electronic tracks are heavily expressive and intuitive, yet come with a particular level of detail and rigidity. The end results are highly addictive LN maps for both players and mappers alike! Recently, they have been able to gain attention with their debut in the loved section [tomatoism – UMP9](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/970727#mania/2032725). However, we believe that is just the beginning of their showcase-worthy mapping career.

An example of a map which demonstrates this is their rendition of [Sta - 99 Glooms](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/961775#mania/2013908). Its liberal usage of flams and more detailed interpretation of the track's various piano and synth are what really take it a step above the rest. Another notable work of theirs is [sasakure.UK - Jack-the-Ripper](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1130177#mania/2360897), a map featuring complex timing and even more complex representation of the track's guitar sounds.

We hope to see Ticle's maps gain more traction as they are definitely worth a shot for any LN enthusiast!

## Mapping Contests

## Around the Community

### New Review System in Beatmap Discussion

Modders, listen. We have great news for you! As some may have already noticed, the modding system got an update and the review system teased many months ago is now finally live.

Some of the mapping boomers among us may remember the old modding system which worked through the forum, fondly titled at times as 'moddingv1'. People would post mods as responses to individual beatmap forum threads, outlining all their issues and improvements at once in big blocks. This was very different from the way that the more modern beatmap discussion system handled things, with it favoring highlighting single issues or improvements at a time.

A lot of modders both old and new favored the older way at times for more in-depth modding, and the big news this time around is that you can now have your cake and eat it too! The beatmap review system now allows you to bundle your individual mods into one big post, reaping the benefits of both worlds.

To access this fancy new wizardry, go into the beatmap discussion of any beatmap you like to mod and then go to the "Review" tab. That's it!

Now you can mod in a format that lets you control what order the mod is read in, which is very useful for reoccurring or bigger issues in maps. Be sure to check out all the features which the current modding system offers to you!

Do you think it could be better or something is still missing? Or did you find a bug in it? The developers would love to hear your feedback! Come join the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) and join the discussion about the review system in the #modding channel!

### The osu!wiki needs you!

The osu!wiki is a huge, community-maintained knowledge base for all things osu!. This includes mapping, modding and gameplay oriented articles, on things ranging from individual map settings to the entire Ranking Criteria, who's on the osu!team, current tournaments, contests and so much more.

This giant compendium of osu! lore is run by a handful of intrepid individuals known to the world as 'wikifriends', and we're always in need of more of them!

If you'd like to help out by reviewing articles, writing them, or translating them into your native language, head on over to the #osu-wiki channel on the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) and say hello.

The world needs you!

Phew, that was a bit of a read, right? We're happy that you made it all the way 'til the end! Once again, we're sorry for the long wait with this month's double-issue. We will work on our schedule to make sure future issues of the Mappers' Report get released on time.

And please, don't forget, should you have anything interesting and mapping or modding related for us to mention, make sure to contact [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717) or [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323) with all the details.
