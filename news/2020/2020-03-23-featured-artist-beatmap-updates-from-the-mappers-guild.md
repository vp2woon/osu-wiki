There's a ton of new beatmaps, completed quests, and medals from the Mappers' Guild celebrating osu!'s featured artists!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/mappersguild.png)

Since the [previous update](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2019-11-29-featured-artist-beatmap-updates-from-the-mappers-guild) a lot has been happening in the guild, with over **20** quests completed, over **100** beatmaps ranked, and **16** new medals for you to earn, all tied to the rapidly growing Featured Artist library!

For those who don't know yet, the Mappers' Guild is a way for mappers with three or more ranked beatmaps to earn rewards for creating beatmaps of songs from the Featured Artist library. If you're interested in the guild, be sure to look at the [Mappers' Guild wiki page](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild) for more information.

Today we'll be going over Mappers' Guild development, finished quests, featured artist beatmap pack and medal updates, and a list of all ranked featured artist beatmaps since our last news post in late November. Now let's start going through all the changes since last update!

## Mappers' Guild system updates

Recently there has been quite a few developments in the Mappers' Guild system, as part of regular rebalancing and improving guild productivity!

- **Anyone can view the website** - Before, it was limited to only members, but now anyone can check in and keep up with what Mappers' Guild members are making, so be sure to check it out if you are curious about what the mappers are working on.
- **Solo quests are now available** - This gives mappers the option to work on smaller projects if that is what they prefer.
- **[Monthly Beatmapping Contests](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest)** - Guild members who participate can also earn points in the Mappers' Guild for doing so, which you can read more about on the linked wiki page. Winners of the contest may also join the guild, bypassing the typical 3 ranked maps requirement.
- **Guild points will now be spent on tasks** - Total points earned over time will still be logged, but now various functions such as accepting quests or extending deadlines and will have an associated point value that must be spent. For accepting quests, normal pack quests will be very cheap, such as 0 points, while solo quests or gimmicky ones (like the previous High Tempo pack) will have higher prices.
- **Quests now expire 3 months after being created** - This means any quest that's still open will be moved to the "expired quests" section. All currently open quests that are older than 3 months will expire on April 2nd. To take quests after they have expired, additional guild points will need to be spent.
- **Quest bonus points have been revised** - The old quest rewards (1-15 points for finishing a quest) no longer exist and focus has been shifted to the per-difficulty bonus points. Quests that are completed on time will get an additional bonus along with that.

A lot of the specific values for the points systems are still being worked on, so if you're a guild member and find it doesn't feel right, such as being too harsh or lenient, be sure to forward your feedback to [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418)!
