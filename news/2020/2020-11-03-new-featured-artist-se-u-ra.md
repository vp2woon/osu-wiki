You know the drill: all of the above plus a whole boatload more (seriously, there's a lot!) are available right now over at [**Se-U-Ra**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/112) all pre-timed and roaring to go.

November's off to a strong start! Did you know during October alone, we added *229* new tracks to the Featured Artist catalogue? That's nearly a 10% increase of our entire library in a single month! Not every month might be so packed, but we do have a whole load more still waiting in the wings, so keep your eyes and ears peeled for more releases.

Stay on top of things by keeping tabs on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for all the details you want to know, especially since there's a most lovely contest brooding on the horizon somewhere soon...

See you on Saturday!
