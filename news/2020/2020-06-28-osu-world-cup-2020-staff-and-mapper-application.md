It's that time of the year again — but wait it's not even October yet! We're putting out a call for people interested in staffing for this year's osu! World Cup, take a look if you're interested!

Staff application is an entire World Cup early this year, with a few new positions to apply for through forms and a way to suggest maps!

### Commentator/Referee

Commentators and referees aim to provide a great live viewing experience.

While referees are the backbone of the matches, commentators are the faces of the stream. Both require a good grasp on the rules and plenty of free time during weekends between late October and early December!

If you are interested in helping out either as a referee or a commentator, please [apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aT7Ln7KWI1p5RkEMLowGDHfZmaaOWHr8hvu6s53J6xA)!

### Mappool Selector

Mappool Selectors are the people working behind closed doors to tinker around on Mappools and aim to give the players their strategical options during matches.

This role will mostly work between July and October, perhaps extending slightly into mid to late November.

[Apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ab6KcX3f4ap5ZtKj9dvGfnHY4Fb_un8DHzpA--dNrFk) for a very thorough application form for this year's Mappool Selector selection process!

### Mapper for custom OWC maps

Since the addition of custom maps from last year's OWC, this year's process will see a few changes.

Mappers will have a way to express their interest in mapping exclusively for the OWC!

Required availability is unfortunately a bit unpredictable, but mostly can be expected between July and November.

[Apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11Nu9bHSYiDj-jxR0Q-qFQTVf4Z6gw1XQfvBxFlx6IM4) if you are interested in helping out!

### Map suggestion

Ever thought a certain map might fit perfectly in the OWC Mappool? Now is your chance to suggest them [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/165TLcKKQiQidB0wCNJ-gFOWoZzf4qSAiNxT3k2jdC_g)!

Thank you to everyone who has and perhaps will express an interest in helping out the OWC! The tournament wouldn't have gotten this far if it weren't for all the community involvement.

Players will have to wait for further details when the deadline draws closer in October!
