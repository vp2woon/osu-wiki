Winter's finally here! And what better way to celebrate it than with a new slew of seasonal backgrounds as voted for by you, plus a little something extra!

Arriving this year with a sense of relief perhaps greater than most, it is at last time to say hello to the wintry months (for some of the world) and get ready to enjoy a chain of highly coveted (and much needed) holidays back-to-back.

In celebration of this, the artists of the osu! community have been hard at work tackling the latest challenge of our Winter Sports fan art contest, and we're proud to say with absolute certainty that they've risen to the occasion.

Not only that, but [**nekodex**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102) (the original osu!musician) has decided to put the finishing touch on this year's winter tree with a brand new festive theme titled *Little Drummer Girl*, putting a bit of a Mocha twist on the old Christmas classic.

Check it out:

Now, without further ado, let us present the winners of the Winter Sports fan art contest, and this year's seasonal winter backgrounds:

*Remember: clicking the banners for each winner will take you to a full size, high quality version of the background!*

Taking to the slopes with a whopping **6763** votes, [**Tofumang**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4817223)'s skiing triple-take on pippi, Chirou and Yuzu enjoying some time in the snow edged above the pack and straight into first place.

While pippi might need to work on her footwork, it is safe to say that Tofumang certainly *doesn't* need to work on his artwork, quickly becoming a fan-favourite with performance after performance in these fan art contests. A victory well earned, well done!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/banners/not%20slepp.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/winners/not%20slepp.png)

Bringing ice-skating to the next level, [**not slepp**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14406940) turned **6192** heads and took names with their incredible rendition of pippi and a catgirl Mocha taking to a frozen park lake in the dark of night.

Absolutely stunning use of colour and light in this piece, with some absurdly cute outfits thrown in for good measure. The voting was neck-to-neck for much of the contest, and one look at this piece reveals precisely why.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/banners/Dem4eg-.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/winners/Dem4eg-.png)

**5583** voters loved [**Dem4eg-**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7206818)'s snowboarding pippi as she carved up some alpine slopes, showcasing that simple and clean (with a big measure of cute thrown in) is more than enough to earn many approving nods from the osu! community.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/banners/Shuuzo.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/winners/Shuuzo.png)

**5171** could not handle the combined cute and coolness of [**Shuuzo**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3661521)'s double-mascot piece, featuring pippi in skis and Mocha on a snowboard showcasing the osu!taiko spirit of all Inner Oni players. Seriously, look at her go!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/banners/ShovelKun.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/winners/ShovelKun.png)

Taking the notion of winter sports to the absolute limit, **4467** voters watched with bated breath as [**ShovelKun**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9948284)'s evening Mocha showcased her parkour skills, vaulting over the rooftops of a skyscraper-filled metropolis.

Did not see this one coming even slightly. Bonus imaginary points for creative use of the theme!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/banners/McFriedFries.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/winners/McFriedFries.png)

**4111** voters were stopped in their tracks by [**McFriedFries**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12694139)'s rendition of pippi, Mocha and a tobogganing don (todonnaning?) enjoying some time in the wintry outdoors.

We also liked that low-key osu! snowboard design more than we'd care to admit.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/banners/Aoki%20chiaki.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/winners/Aoki%20chiaki.png)

**3992** stars twinkled in [**Aoki chiaki**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7692958)'s night sky figure skating marvel, showcasing Alisa, Mocha and pippi gracefully twirling about the inside of a glass-domed conservatory.

Hard to argue with pure elegance!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/banners/N0W0.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/winners/N0W0.png)

Speed skating was the name of the game with [**N0W0**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14634525)'s INCREDIBLY detailed entry, winning over **3889** voters. Featuring not only absurdly cute takes on both pippi, Chirou and the Taikonator but also a slew of custom osu!-themed sponsor brands, unique outfit designs and an entire assemblage of national flags in the background, the effort that went into this piece was simply extraordinary.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/banners/PacifiedPaints.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/winners/PacifiedPaints.png)

**3780** voters fell hook, line and sinker for [**PacifiedPaints**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8377453)' ice fishing Mocha. We love it when people get creative with the theme limitations, and this one is no exception.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/banners/Dreamxiety.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/winners/Dreamxiety.png)

[**Dreamxiety**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233) scored **3494** nods of approval for their most athletic Mocha enjoying some time on the slopes with a very eager don. Beautiful use of perspective really gives this piece the "big" feeling that you commonly find in these sorts of places in real life, which is a neat touch.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/banners/HEKUSODASU.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/winners/HEKUSODASU.png)

CHOOSE YOUR CHARACTER! **3323** got stuck at the selection screen thanks to [**HEKUSODASU**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9044692)'s take on an all-out snowball war. Who needs Call of Duty when you've got Dean Herbert's Lazer Snowball Brawl?

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/banners/Kwms024.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/winners/Kwms024.png)

**3159** voters were wowed by [**Kwms024**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11516014)'s wonderfully stylized piece, which we've affectionately titled as 'pippi in motion'.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/banners/Sjao.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/winners/Sjao.png)

Back at it again, **3100** spectators watched in awe as [**Sjao**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7295733)'s tiara-toting Mocha twirled her way across a field of ice on skates. Exceptional use of colour, contract and lighting in general, as we've come to expect from Sjao after their recent performances in the fan art contests lately.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/banners/Hecatia.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/winners/Hecatia.png)

**2269** voters copped a smug, sidelong glance from [**Hecatia**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8244635)'s pippi in the process of being soundly beaten in a skiing races. The author of this newspost wishes to say only one extra thing: assets.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/banners/Kiragi%20Sakki.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/114/winners/Kiragi%20Sakki.png)

**2210** voters got their Olympic show-skating fix this year from [**Kiragi Sakki**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10414550)'s take on the official mascots flaunting their skill on skates. Mani and Yuzu are having a bit of a moment back there, just leave them to it, they'll be right.

Thank you to all the artists who participated in this year's fan art contests in general, and an extra double thanks for being so patient with us regarding the delays in getting the results out this time around. We ran a bit of an earlier schedule for the contests this year, which mucked up our routine a little.

We'll still be with you for the remainder of the year with twice-weekly Featured Artist releases running through Christmas and New Years, so keep your eyes and ears peeled for all that.

2020 has been a tough year for most of us, and here's to hoping that 2021 shines a little brighter.

Happy holidays from all of us here on the team, and remember — rhythm is just a click away!
