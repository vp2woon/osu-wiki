We're setting off on a new adventure with **Disasterpeace**, our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/81/header.jpg)

The man behind the aural wonder of hit indie game *FEZ*'s hugely popular soundtrack, [**Disasterpeace**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/81) is an American musician and composer whose work was extraordinarily popular back in the 2014 days of the osu! mapping scene.

Though some of those hit tracks like *I Am Only a Man* remain out of reach for now, we're excited to share a catalogue of **16** tracks with you, including several popular pieces from *FEZ*.

[Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515) from the Mappers' Guild has also been hard at work creating a brand new modern showcase map set to [Wagering Lights](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1163910), so make sure to check it out if you want to experience the new to go with the old!

Check out a sample of what's available:

As usual, all of the above plus a whole lot more are available right now from [**Disasterpeace**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/81), so if this kind of stuff is your jam, put that jam in a beatmap-shaped jar and get to sharing it with the world! Everything is all pre-timed and awaiting your creative touch.

Tweeters @radarrrrrrr and @Ehix80127434 were the quickest on the hint draw this week, sussing out our latest artist with little effort involved. Very fitting for a guy who calls himself radar. Well done!

The Featured Artist train never truly stops, and accordingly the rest of May is lined up with a grand variety of new artists that we're sure you're going to love. And that's not even talking about June, which has some stonker names sitting in the waiting list which are going to blow people's minds wide open. Make sure to keep tabs on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for all the latest news and hints for next week's artist, and until then, have fun clicking circles!
