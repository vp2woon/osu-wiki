Spring is here, and though a lot of us are currently stuck indoors for the most part, we're not going to let that dampen our artistic spirit!

Whether you're a new face or a grizzled veteran, these contests always start with just one question: do you like to draw?

If you do, **draw any of the osu! mascots (official or community) in a cosy Spring indoor setting for a chance at getting your art featured in-game as a seasonal background, and more!**

Yes, you read that right, **Spring indoors.** What this means is entirely up to you as long as it is cosy, Spring, and indoors. Bust out your shut-in getups, board games, movie backlog, books, or whatever else you can think of and put them in the hands of our mascots!

You've got **14 days** from the date of this post to [sneak your entry into our auto-magical contest system](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/92) (after ensuring it fits all the rules below, of course) and once time is up, we'll be placing all the eligible pieces up for a big community vote lasting an entire week.

A top selection of the entries as voted by all of you will go on to become Spring 2020's seasonal background pack, and will award their authors a couple of months of osu! supporter and a shiny new profile badge to acknowledge their victory.

Interested? Check out the rules below:

## Rules

- **All entries MUST be themed around enjoying Spring indoors and feature at least one (or more) of the osu! mascots (either official or community).** Normally we do Spring as a whole, but this year we're taking it indoors. Don't get caught out(side)!
- **All entries MUST be suitable for all-ages viewing.** No smut or anything particularly questionable (nudity, overly revealing clothing, etc), please. We will pull your entry and keep it for ourselves.
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK. REDRAWING AND COMPOSITE WORKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** People found to be plagiarising will be removed from the contest and forbidden from entering any others for the rest of the year.
- **ATTRIBUTION (artist names, Twitter handles, etc) must be limited to NO MORE THAN THREE LINES TOTAL and confined to either the bottom left or bottom right corners of your piece.** Artists are entitled to plug their own links in their pieces, but we really want them to not be huge and just a marker for people to use to locate you in other places. Excessive attribution can also skew the voting results somewhat since we don't typically scrub it out.
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece - namely 2732x1536. THIS IS CHECKED BY A SCRIPT AND ENTRIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE DISCARDED AUTOMATICALLY.** Not meeting the EXACT dimensions listed above is the #1 reason for entries getting left out. Check your export resolutions and make sure the actual file has the proper dimensions! Turn off auto-trimming in export settings.
- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed on the main menu and during the voting process.** Please consult previous entries in the series to understand what we mean here. In smaller words, big osu! cookie takes up most of the screen. Design your piece accordingly.
- **DO NOT LEAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR SUBMISSION!**
- **ACCOUNT FOR THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE IN THE COMPOSITION OF YOUR WORK!**
- **MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR WORK!**
- **DO NOT SUBMIT ENTRIES WITH THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE!** Get the message yet?
- **Don't use copyrighted characters from other intellectual properties.** You can freely use any of the osu! mascots (pippi, Yuzu, Mocha, Maria) and any of the community mascots (Tama, Aiko, Taikonator, any of the submissions from the Most Manic Art contest also apply), but avoid using direct representations of characters from other worlds or franchises in your work. Remember that the community mascots are also someone else's creation, so make sure to treat their work with the same respect that you'd treat yours.
