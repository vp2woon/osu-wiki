The osu!catch World Cup has a rich history of titanic rivalries, clutch comebacks and underdog Cinderella stories, and this year's tournament was no exception. Whether it be Saudia Arabia looking right at home in their first ever World Cup appearance, Italy playing three weeks' of consecutive TieBreakers, or even the eternal Twitch chat debate of whether [frogs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/12221) are cooler than [cats](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1119839), this year once again gave us some truly memorable moments!

However, it would be China, South Korea and The United States who would rise above the rest and do battle for the final time in the Grand Finals. Feel free to read on for a rapid rundown, but if you find yourself with time to spare during the lockdown, you can relive the greatest matches and moments on the [osu!live Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive), along with all previous rounds if you need a refresher!

**Congratulations to Team South Korea for winning the osu!catch World Cup 2020!**

South Korea successfully defended their osu!catch World Championship title for the second time to extend their winning record to five trophies after previous successes in 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2019. Despite suffering a narrow TieBreaker loss to China in the Winners' Bracket final, it was South Korea who claimed the final victory in consecutive 7-3 victories following a Bracket Reset. Their strength in depth, tactical thinking and technical proficiency set them above their peers when the going got tough, and they truly demonstrated why so many of their members consistently rank amongst the highest reaches of the leaderboards.

With their victory, Team South Korea will receive the grand prize of $150 per team member, snazzy new profile badges, and the highly coveted "osu!catch Champion" user title for the next year!

**Team China claim a spot on the podium for the sixth consecutive year in second!**

Team China once again produced a stellar run in the osu!catch World Cup, having recorded a top two finish in every edition of the premier fruit-catching tournment since 2015. However, despite victories in 2016 and 2018, they are yet to break the curse of facing South Korea in a Grand Final, succumbing to a fourth loss to the east Asian juggernaut on the grandest stage of all. As expected, the Chinese roster produced some of the most spectacular plays of the tournament (with [Crystal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1646397)'s astounding [Winner's Bracket Final TieBreaker SS](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/642846934?t=1h26m17s) performance a particular highlight), but could not quite pull off the consistent team performance to claim ultimate victory.

Team China will receive a prize of $80 per team member and profile badges as reward for yet another year of excellence in the fruit realm.

**Team United States returns to the podium and claims a well-deserved third place!**

On somewhat of an island in 2020, The United States were comfortably able to keep the rest of the chasing pack at arm's length, but could never quite match the prowess of the Grand Finalists, falling 6-2 to South Korea in the SemiFinal stage and 7-2 during their rematch in the Losers' Bracket Final. Possessing a great mix of specialists in different skills, The United States strategised to perfection and performed strongly against the majority of their rivals, but fell short against South Korea's all-star "jack-of-all-trades" team composition.

Team United States will receive a prize of $40 per team member and profile badges to celebrate their comeback to the podium after missing out last year.
