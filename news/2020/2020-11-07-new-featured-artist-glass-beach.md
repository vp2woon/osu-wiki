We're off to new musical shores with our latest addition to the Featured Artist lineup, **glass beach**!

Rocking more attitude and personality than groups three times their size, the 4 piece band known as **glass beach** is one of the most promising bands around lately, if their meteoric rise to fame on Spotify is any indication. Sporting a bombastic, jazzy, theatrical and genre-bending sound, they've drawn acclaim from all across the indie scene for doing what they do.

The avid scorewatchers among us might remember **glass beach** from a recent play made by [Vaxei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4787150) on [quantumvortex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10660777)'s map for [bedroom community](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1198613), well and truly bringing them into the limelight.

We've got a selection of **12** new tracks from them now available (including the track mentioned above, naturally), so if you want to see what all the hype is about, there's never been a better time. Not only that, but the Mappers' Guild is on the case with two new showcase maps to boot!

Check out a brief preview of some below:

All of the above plus a bunch more are available over at [**glass beach**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/113), pre-timed and awaiting your individual touch. You too could be the mapper of the next top-player approved hit, if you care to try!

As an extra special surprise, if you're reading this at roughly 21:00 UTC (aka, when the post was released), the crew from **glass beach** will be streaming their first forays into osu! live over at [their Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/glassbeachband) for you to witness in all of their newbie glory. Pop in, meet the minds behind the music and say hello!

That's all for this week, but we'll have another artist for you this coming Wednesday, as usual. Keep tabs on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for more news and fun things you'll probably want to know.

See you next week!
