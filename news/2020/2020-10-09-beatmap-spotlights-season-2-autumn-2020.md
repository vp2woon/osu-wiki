Howdy, Spotlight chasers! As many of you are already aware, the Summer Season 2020 is over, and we are here to finally announce the **beginning of Autumn Season 2020**, with new features and updates frequently asked for by the community!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/beatmap-spotlights.jpg)

After listening to your feedback, we expect this season to be dynamic, slightly faster, better balanced and more diverse than last time. With those things in mind, we've modified the length of time that timeshift lobbies are open and finally added support for mods.

For those interested in getting straight into playing in the new season, **the lobbies for the Beatmap Spotlights are open now on the osu!lazer client**, so head on over and get cracking!

Check out what we have planned for this season in detail:

### League-related aspects

- **Lobbies will be open for the whole week.** We realized that making the timeshift lobbies only available on the weekends is difficult for a lot of players interested in participating our league system and thus we will now keep it open for the whole week instead, starting from today.
- **Some playlists will now feature mods.** A fundamental part for a diverse gameplay is to add mods, especially if we want to give skilled players a bit more of a challenge! But do not worry about having your favourite song or map featured as a mod-only difficulty. All maps that feature mods will also have their original version available. We want to keep it fair and fun for everyone!

*Note: osu!taiko will not be able to feature mods this season due to limitations with osu!lazer's current implementation.*

### General aspects

- **The best mappers of each season will be rewarded**. Players are not the only fundamental aspect of each season, maps and mappers are also very important to the whole system. With that in mind, we decided mappers will also get their own spotlight! The rewards are going to be explained below in more details.

## Mappers of the Season

After each season has finalized, the curators will handpick a mapper featured in the Beatmap Spotlights map pool for each gamemode and declare them as the best mapper of the season, netting them a tidy **3 months of osu!supporter** for their efforts.

To get things started, we're starting this new initiative off straight away with the participants of the Summer Beatmap Spotlights:

- osu!: [Limp Bizkit - Take A Look Around \[life lesson feat. piroshki\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1109633#osu/2318842) by [FCL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4715762)
- osu!taiko: [LeaF - Doppelganger (extended ver.) \[Inner Oni\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/833092#taiko/1746831) by [Reficul](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1506011)
- osu!catch: [IKIMONOGAKARI - Blue Bird feat. k*chan [ dj-Jo Remix ] TV Size \[Overdose\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1174801#fruits/2450381) by [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883)
- osu!mania: [Chroma - lost memory (Youwhang) \[a light received from you.\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/961321#mania/2012530) by [Youwhang](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3011818)

Congratulations to those who won! We're planning to keep investigating ways we can make the Beatmap Spotlights more rewarding for everyone, so stay tuned.

## The Future

As much as we would love to announce a bunch of new amazing features, the new Beatmap Spotlights is still a project on its early development stage and depends a lot on community feedback and engagement to improve. Many things can change and enhancements can be done for future seasons, and it all depends on *your* feedback!

What do you want for the next season? What needs to be fixed? What are your opinions on the current system? You can voice out all your opinions [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1189626) and we will keep note of every suggestion, always seeking for improvement.

We do hope you have enjoyed the Summer Season 2020, and, of course, we do hope that you enjoy the Autumn Season even more. See you in the upcoming timeshift lobbies!
