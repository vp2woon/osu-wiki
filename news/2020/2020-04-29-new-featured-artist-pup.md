**PUP** is here and making a statement as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/79/header.jpg)

Taking the North Americas and later the world by storm since 2010, [**PUP**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/79) are a Canadian punk rock band with equal parts sass and skill. Fabulously frantic in that special kind of rock-star way, anyone familiar with the *Guitar Hero* or *Rock Band* games is going to feel right at home in their grungy sound.

To welcome them aboard, we've snagged a prime selection of **20** tracks, enlisting the intrepid minds from the Mappers' Guild to produce two brand new showcase maps to join another two existing classics from members of the community.

Check out a sample of what's what below:
