While first-rate Featured Artists are added every new week, let's not forget about the equally talented artists in our back catalog! We've got **40** brand new tracks from **8** of our current Featured Artists ready for your mapping touch!

Here's how this works: **click an artist's name or banner to visit their Featured Artist page.** New tracks will be marked with a not-so-subtle *NEW* icon (seen below), and they'll probably be found at the bottom of each artist's listing.

Simple, right? Let's get down to business.

Issho nara!**! This addition comes packed with 3 versions of the track with different lengths: one is 5:00, another is 2:30, and the last is the classic TV Size 1:30.

Oh, and in case this update + weekly new Featured Artist announcements weren't enough for you, we've got some special plans to make our artists even more accessible to mappers who'd prefer to map shorter songs. Stay tuned!
