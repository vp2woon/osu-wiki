- **[Cleaning up the unmapped audio guideline](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/996498)**: This rule has been adjusted a bit with some discussion along with being moved to a guideline as there are clear exceptions stated in it, making it more suitable as a guideline.

### osu!catch

- **[Rewording of the current spinner rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1144293)**: This rule change has the goal of allowing for innovative spinner patterns.

### osu!mania

### NAT Additions

A star shining brighter than the sun has ascended from the Beatmap Nominators and is now shining in a scary red color in the osu! sky. [hypercyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9155377) is the newest addition to the Nomination Assessment Team! After two years of work in the Beatmap Nominators, he will now support the osu! NAT with the evaluation of applications and Beatmap Nominators to ensure a constant flow of new additions to the BNG.

Among the fruit catchers shines another star, with [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598) joining the NAT for osu!catch. With being a BAT in 2014 and a GMT in 2015, he made his comeback just three months ago as a Beatmap Nominator and now back to the red names as a NAT. He will aid Deif and Greaper on their mission to keep the mapping scene of osu!catch alive!

So once more: Welcome hypercyte & Spectator!

### NAT Retirement

For where there's good news, sad news soon follows. [Nepuri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6637817) has decided to take his leave. In over a year of work he has helped the osu!taiko Beatmap Nominators to get back to their old strength. Now that he successfully accomplished this task, we hope he will find a well deserved rest.

Thank you for all your hard work for the game and we wish you all the best!

### Beatmap Nominator Expectations

As of October 2nd, a set of expectations was outlined for Beatmap Nominators, and it is to be treated as an extension to the BN rules. These expectations cover a variety of points to help keep the ever-growing group of Beatmap Nominators at a good standard!

The expectations can be found [here](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators/Expectations).

### Changes in handling of hybrid beatmapsets

Hybrid map sets were always a grey area when it comes to nominations. They needed only two nominations in the past, just as single game mode map sets. This has changed as of the 2nd of October. Now every map set needs **two nominations per game mode**. For example:
If you have a hybrid map set with osu!taiko, osu!catch & osu!mania, it will now need a total of **6** nominations.

For this change Beatmap Nominators were divided into game mode specific user groups. You can see which game mode a nominator belongs to on their user page. Right next to the BN Symbol, their game mode gets displayed now!

## Mappers' Showcase

As with every issue of the Mappers' Report we want to show you more unknown mappers who deserve some spotlight for their maps! This time, to cover a whole season, we have osu!taiko, osu!catch and osu!mania for you! So let's dive right into it.

Huge thanks to [Capu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2474015) & [radar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7131099) for covering osu!taiko, [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134) & [autofanboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114) for osu!catch and [Davvy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10047413) & [Unpredictable](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7560872) for osu!mania!

### Haexys (osu!taiko)

A newer mapper with a lot of promise hailing from France, [Heaxys](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5671417) brings his taste for metal music to life in a way that not many other mappers can. His first ranked map [Devour Me, Colossus (Part I): Blackholes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1117322#taiko/2333970) from the Featured Artist [Ne Obliviscaris](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/86) is 12 minutes and 31 seconds of extremely well-crafted mapping, featuring comfortable and well-fitting patterns with slider velocities that accompany them very well. This is overall an amazing experience, however, his single ranked map is not the only quality map he's brought to the table.

Another map to highlight is his rendition of [FALLUJAH - Venom Upon the Blade](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1176016#taiko/2452862), another well crafted streamy 240BPM map with a really tough outro that's sure to bring a fun challenge to anyone capable of bashing drums at this level!

We speak for many people when I say we are looking forward to seeing Heaxys develop as a mapper and bring more exquisite metal maps to the ranked section!

### gaston\_2199 (osu!taiko)

While definitely not a new face to the ranked section, [gaston\_2199](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5938161) is a highly underrated mapper whose name is rarely brought up in conversations, even though they truly deserve it! When they initially ranked [Muzzy - Endgame](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/519474#taiko/1103553) back in 2016, they got credited for their nice variations in such a variety-lacking drum'n'bass song!

Not only does gaston\_2199 like to map DnB, but they also recently got their hands on something more technical. [Onis Keyboard](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1176086#taiko/2453006) by the artist pm04034 is a pretty big set, offering 7 difficulties for players of all levels. The top diff being especially interesting, due to the nature of the song, which offers many rhythmic changes and a bit variety of snappings that all got implemented in a very clean style.

The volume control is also something that gaston\_2199 never misses to play around with, which is something that is often overlooked. Complex snaps and some SV changes every now and then form a very engaging and fun to play map! We hope we never have to miss gaston\_2199 in the ranked section, as they keep a very high quality throughout all the years of their activity. Leave them a nice comment and go enjoy their maps if you haven't already!

### -MomoX (osu!catch)

[-MomoX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2150415) is a promising osu!catch mapper from the Philippines. Starting off with his mapping career in 2018, -MomoX has a solid understanding of mapping concepts, techniques, and musical knowledge. As a high-tier fruit catcher, -MomoX has been incorporating innovative patterns and difficulty settings into his renditions to test players' reading, speed, and stamina.

In terms of mapping style, -MomoX is a slider enthusiast who loves to emphasize strong beats via hyperdash sliders. He is capable of maneuvering such gimmicks consistently without breaking the flow. A prime example would be [rejection - Signal feat. Such](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1129636#fruits/2359821), his recently ranked marathon. It's also worth checking out his slider hell map [Halozy - Kikoku Doukoku Jigokuraku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/990511#fruits/2071833), which features a flurry of droplets by using a high slider tick rate to design odd-shaped sliders.

Despite having vast experience in creating challenging maps, -MomoX is adept at finishing spreads with easier difficulties. His Cup in [nanobii - Rainbow Road](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1234892#fruits/2571138) uses horizontal sliders and curved sliders extensively to match the main beats while offering leniency towards beginners. With his recent mapping activity and welcoming attitude towards feedback, more projects to watch out for should be coming from -MomoX!

### -Joakh (osu!catch)

A rising star in the osu!catch mapping scene, [-Joakh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7946084) is a newer mapper that's mostly fond of eroge music! His mapping style is mainly clean and consistency-based showing that he clearly knows what he's doing! With the high activity of map production and the presence they've been parading to the mapping community, he certainly deserves recognition!

His second ranked map [Suzuyu - Euphorium](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1254692#fruits/2607602) features a simple yet engrossing finesse through the apt variation of flow and patterning, as well as perfect representation of the music provided. Not only does he convey his fixation to eroge, [M2U feat. Guriri - Marigold (VIP Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1257779#fruits/2614247) reveals that -Joakh can project technical mapping fashion as well! Showcasing peculiar stream shapes and diverse flow usage, it is a must-see for fruit catchers!

As we all know, eroge mappers are destined for greatness! With more time and experience, -Joakh can definitely be one of the top mappers in osu!catch! Something worth mentioning would also be his capability of mapping high bpm songs such as his take on [UNDEAD CORPORATION - The Empress scream off ver](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1285068#fruits/2668183). We hope to see more of -Joakh's maps and hopefully, his motivation further grows as he is unquestionably a very promising mapper!

### guden (osu!mania)

A promising upcoming name amongst both the ranked and the competitive scene is [guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065), having gotten their first qualified map just a couple of days ago, namely his set of [Camellia - Alone intelligence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1235533#mania/2568385). Overall, his mapping style shows a charming blend of several notable influences, such as mint’s consistent structure, the unconventional, unique concepts of Abraxos, the melodic style of Shoegazer, and Monheim’s expressive and allocated layering.

All these influences come together very well in his map [kaitendaentai - Hizai ni Negu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1304769#mania/2705462), most notably in how well the barrage of notes flow, which best illustrates the breakcoreish, frantic drums. Other elements the map is notable for are how well structured the map is with respect to the music, how specific chords are allocated for specific events and how certain unusual musical moments are mapped in unusual ways and are combined in a rather well-executed manner.

While they are still trying to find their own voice in the scene, it will be quite fascinating to see how guden will develop as a mapper. He is always willing to try something new and has already been making great strides in improving.

### MJHs (osu!mania)

[MJHs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2288943) is a Korean mapper who’s been in and out of the mania mapping community since late 2018, but has been getting a bit of traction as of recently within the anti-meta keymode community, primarily 5K. A lot of his maps from the start of his mapping career were pretty straightforward and simplistic, to say the least. However, he’s been notably trying new and innovative concepts to implement into his newer maps that definitely make him stand out amongst a crowd of 5K mappers. Although the 5K community is fairly small, his dedication to the keymode is unwavering. This small and niche spot within the community is the reason why many of his maps are starting to hold amazingly in the current 5K mapping scene, despite not having any ranked maps as of now.

One of the most solidified maps in his mapping discography is [Konami Amusement (Wakita Jun) - Vide Nostalgia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1197900#mania/2530522), which not only displays some excellent timing craftsmanship but also shows well-executed, heavy PR patterning whilst maintaining mapping standards that fit along with the song beautifully. The map also features a constant 3/4 timing signature that can somewhat throw players off from the 4/4 timing signature that many are accustomed to, making this quite a challenge to obtain accuracy on. The mapset as a whole resembles MJH’s current mapping style perfectly, which is why it holds such an important place in his mapping discography.

Another mapset of his that is rather new compared to some of the older ones, but still an amazing set is [Akaru muu - Choukousoku henbyoushi no alien](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1324800#mania/2749712), which somewhat resembles a lot of big and notable features that Vide Nostalgia has, yet turns up a couple of notches. Easily one of his more complex and interesting maps, the map features very odd and complexing time signatures that’ll definitely catch many players off guard, whilst capturing the song gracefully through pretty complex rhythms and structures. He does all of this whilst also maintaining PR and heavy repetition when the song calls for it, making this one hell of a challenge to FC and obtain accuracy on for many players. Definitely give this a try if you’re looking for a challenge.

We hope to see MJHs make more maps in the future as it’s pretty clear he’s making a name for himself in the 5K community thus far, and hopefully we can see him rank some maps whilst he’s at it!

## Mapping Contests

Did someone ask for contests? No? Ahh well, you get them anyways! As always we inform you about any interesting mapping related contests going on. Even if you do not plan to participate in them, you might want to check them out to see if any of them have an open voting phase going on! Don't forget: Every vote counts!

Should you know about any other interesting contests, please let us know! We would love to touch upon them in our further news posts!

### Monthly Beatmapping Contest

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest series is continuing as strongly as ever, albeit with some changes, but also with some awesome results to share! Starting with MBC \#8, the contest has changed to a judge-based format. In old iterations, the screeners would pick maps for the community to vote on. They still function the same, but now the final vote comes down to a panel of judges with detailed impressions and scoring. For MBC \#9 the formula was further mixed up by allocating a **theme** for the contest instead of a **restriction**. With these changes, we get to see an ever-evolving contest format to stay excited about!

For MBC \#8, the restriction was that sliders could not be used, and [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515)'s entry of [Silentroom - NULCTRL](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1266008#osu/2631203) with its excellent use of circles, **circle size 7**, and screen-usage based patterning won over the judge's hearts. He has now earned enough points in MBC for a tier 2 profile badge, and is all that much closer to obtaining the coveted title of elite mapper! Well deserved!

In MBC \#9, the theme was that every object must overlap with another one. With its results, mapper [xbopost](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6842421) came in first place with his entry of [PUP - See You At Your Funeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1289138#osu/2676185), which took the theme well to heart as they built a unique and interesting map and gameplay experience that you should be sure to check out! That's not all though, as this is xbopost's **third** time coming in first place in MBC and they have now earned the esteemed title of **Elite Mapper**!

In MBC \#10, the restriction was that only sliders could be used, and one mapper coming out of nowhere, [0ppInOsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12551840) managed to take the win! Fully embracing the variable slider velocity and obscure slider-shape style that defines technical mapping, he impressed judges with peak performance in almost all categories.
For this outstanding performance they were awareded with the tier 1 profile badge. We hope to see much more from them in the future!

It's certainly well deserved, with each of their entries providing well built and interesting experiences that make excellent use of the challenges MBC provides. They are certainly a mapper to keep up with in the future as well!

The MBC \#10 was also the last one in the year 2020. The contest will take a little break now, but fear not! We are sure that the next MBC won't take long once we are in 2021. So stay tuned and make sure to keep your eyes open for the news post!

### A Labour of Love

A brand new contest appeared out of nowhere. Something that we never had before in osu! [A Labour of Love](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-11-30-a-labour-of-love) will go with you through more than just the complete mapping experience!

For this **team-based contest**, you will have to gather your friends to make a unique remix of the well-known osu! song [Kuba Oms](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/13) - [My Love](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/163112). But that's not all! Next, you will have to create a complete osu! beatmap spread for your own created remix. And what shouldn't be missing when creating a beatmap? A storyboard or own created video, of course!

As there is really a lot to do, the contests dead line is the **end of February 2021**.

We hope to see a lot of cool remixes and beatmaps coming from this contest and we will surely let you know once there are some results out!

### osu! Mapping Olympiad #7: Results (osu!mania)

The results of the osu! Mapping Olympiad are finally here, throwing a big surprise at us. For the first time in the history of the Olympiad, two mappers share the 1st place with having the exact same score. Congratulations to [Kawawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4647754) & [Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811) being awarded for their outstanding performance with the tier 1 Mapping Olympiad Badge and the **Elite Mapper** user title!

As if this wasn't enough, the 3rd place is also shared by two mappers, matching the exact same score. [lenpai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5314573) & [BringoBrango](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10274043) managed as well to impress the judges with their entries. Both of their scores were pretty high and very close to first place, with only a difference of 2.5!

We can't wait to see what the next osu! Mapping Olympiad will bring to us!

### osu! Beatmapping World Championship 2020

After 5 fast months, the osu! Beatmapping World Championship 2020 has come to an end. It's difficult to express just how amazing of a project and competition it was to watch, and that each team brought their best selves - resulting in some of the closest rounds of the competition right at the end! For full details on the journey, scoring, and more, be sure to check out the [dedicated conclusion newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-10-22-beatmapping-world-championship-2020-concludes).

## Around the Community

Hello! We're back with the latest segment of Around the Community! This time we have a bunch of awesome guides that have been put out recently! Should you have something worth including that isn't here already, be sure to let [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717) or [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323) know about it! We're happy to give it more attention in our news post!

### Community Guides

With this issue, we have several mapping and modding related guides to spotlight! The knowledge base the mapping community makes and shares with each other grows ever bigger, and we hope that this can help you find some cool ideas or new content to learn from.

The first is a new YouTube video by the experienced player, mapper, modder, and NAT member [Seto Kousuke](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2857314)! In his video [5 advices for newbie mappers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrvfYtYaIAA) he goes over some tips from his experienced perspective that may not be intuitive for beginner mappers to learn, and watching it can be a great way for aspiring mappers to start getting pointed in the right direction in their mapping journey.

The next is a pair of recent videos from a long-time mapper and Beatmap Nominator [Sonnyc](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11771). The first, [Making Symmetric Sliders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYkMFvq4ZLU) serves to quickly show you how to make symmetrical sliders quickly. Even if you don't map symmetrically, knowing how to make balanced sliders to manipulate later can be hugely helpful. The second, [Increasing Mapping Speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMKJ9H-qGg0) goes over an experience nearly every mapper has had - mapping slowly at first, and then later how to improve on putting your ideas out there quickly. Other videos on Sonnyc's channel can be super helpful guides to mappers new and old alike, so be sure to check them out!

Moving away from motivation, time taken, and visuals, we have a [guide all about hitsounding](https://hackmd.io/@Net0/HitsoundsGuide) by [Net0](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5099768)! This guide about hitsounds is incredibly in-depth, going all the way from how to name your files to theory, choosing samples, using the editor, and how hitsounding relates back to actual instruments in the songs we love to map and play. If you've ever found hitsounding beatmaps to be intimidating, this guide will definitely help to clear up a lot of questions about it you may have.

Finally, on a bit of a different flavor we have a guide not related to mapping - but modding! The [Modding Mentorship Guide](https://sites.google.com/view/modding-guide/home) written by a long-time mapper and nominator [Cheri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5226970) seeks to help give guidance on how to mod and what to look out for from the ground up. This guide covers everything from ranking criteria, to rhythm, to spacing, to low difficulties, and spread. It covers quite a lot! In-depth modding guides of this kind are a bit rarer and left to people often learning on their own, so having a fully fleshed out guide like this will definitely be really helpful to aspiring and semi-experienced modders alike.

And that concludes the last issue of the Mappers' Report in the year 2020! Quite a lot to read again, but we are happy should you have survived until here.

To end the year, the lead of the Mappers' Report [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717), would like to drop a few words:

The Mappers' Report started as a project together with the Beatmap Nominators out of a whim after a NAT Meeting. At first, we, the NAT, just wanted to use this as a platform to reach more participants for the meetings and to inform those who couldn't participate in what exactly was discussed. This worked by the way!
But over time I have gotten more ideas for the whole project and it became huge! I added more categories because I wanted to bring as much information about the most important aspects of osu! to as many people as possible.

This whole project would not have been that successful as it is now without the help of so many people. I wish I could thank everyone who helped in a proper way, but sadly I can't name all because the ending here would become as large as the whole news post. Be sure that I am thankful for really everyone who helped me with it in the past, either by writing sections or picking the mapper for the Mappers' Showcase. But I also want to mention a few special people here:

First of all a lot of thanks to [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323) who supported it from the very beginning and helped a lot with writing. I could never make this news post such a big success without you. So a thousand thanks for staying all this time and helping me with the Mappers' Report.

Next, I would like to thank the whole osu! wiki team and all volunteers helping out by proof-reading the whole news post once the pull request is opened, and by helping me correct so many grammar mistakes I did, thereby making the whole news post overall more comfortable to read. I am not a native English speaker but I still work on improving it! So thank you all for the help and I hope I can count on you in the future too.

Last but not least, I would like to thank all readers of the Mappers' Report. A news post is nothing without the people who want to read it. Every time we have been late with it, I have received a lot of private messages from people wondering when the next issue will be released. This time is no exception. I am sorry that I have made you wait. This project has become more important to me than I could have imagined, all thanks to your positive feedback and support. Thank you so much and I hope you will continue to stay with us in the next year as well!

And to end this, here as always, a little self-advertising:

As you know, our news post is completely community driven by volunteers from writing up until the final checks before the release. Therefore, we always welcome another pair of hands for help. Should you be interested in helping us out to get the future issues released more on time, stop by at the `#mappers-report` channel on the [osu! Community Discord](https://discord.gg/0Vxo9AsejDkGlk3H).

Hope to see you there soon, thank you for reading and stay safe and healthy!
