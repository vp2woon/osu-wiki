We're proud to announce the latest addition to the Featured Artist lineup — the one and only **Teminite**!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/64/header.jpg)

You know him, you love him, now he's here to stay. From *Highscore* and *Immortal Flame* fame (featuring the stupendously talented [Panda Eyes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/55) as well), **Teminite** is a highly vaunted electronic music producer from the United Kingdom and has made waves across a bunch of big-name labels in recent years with his originals, remixes, and collaborative works.

We've managed to snag a whopping assortment of **48** new tracks for you to sink your creative teeth into, including most of his hit singles, and vast swathes of his album and EP releases.

In an extra special surprise, two intrepid souls from the [Mappers' Guild](https://mappersguild.com/) have been hard at work creating a brand new preview map featuring one of **Teminite**'s tracks to highlight the kind of awesome you could be making yourself in the near future.

Without further ado, check out [this wicked set](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1089017#osu/2276963) from [hypercyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9155377) (also rhymes with **Teminite** by the way) which sports an ambient storyboard by the ever-talented [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323)!

All of the above and so, so much more is available **right now** over at [**Teminite**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/64), bundled up in pre-timed packages just waiting for you to impart your magnificent mapping magic on them.

What do an anime girl, a stick of celery and a top 250 UK EZ player have in common? If you guessed a brain of galactic proportions, you're correct! Congratulations to Twitter users @TaigaIsMyWaifu, @celerih and @VenoxiaOsu for correctly deciphering this release's hint! Make sure to shower them with your praise and adoration.

Check back next week for yet another Featured Artist, because this train is no longer physically capable of slowing down or stopping. Make sure to stop by the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) in the days before for a hint to agonize over, if that's your thing.
