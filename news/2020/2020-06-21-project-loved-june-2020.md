[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-06-21-project-loved-june-2020/osu/1-revenge-reek-s-dude-what-s-a-genre-remix.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1092786)

[TryHardNinja feat. CaptainSparklez - Revenge (ReeK's "Dude, What's A Genre?" Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1071189#osu) by [Fisky](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8352623)\
128 – 165 BPM, 4:34 | 6.88★, 7.50★

Despite not having any ranked maps, Fisky is an incredibly skilled mapper whose forte lies in their ability to make high-difficulty technical maps that are even higher in quality. A perfect example of this is their map of *Revenge*, a high-intensity song whose potential was used to its fullest, resulting in a map that sits at 7.5 stars and features all sorts of unique patterns. A second difficulty is included in the mapset that nerfs some of the patterns in the main difficulty and rests just below 7 stars.

On top of all the intricacies that go into making this map special, the mapper has worked three easter eggs into the map! If that caught your attention, you'll definitely want to check this one out. The map itself is split into various sections that each feature different patterns, so for those of you looking for a fresh experience on a challenging technical map, this is easily one of the best maps you can find.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-06-21-project-loved-june-2020/osu/2-prayer.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1092785)

[Ducky Chix - Prayer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/954556#osu) by [Taikuta](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/207967)\
160 BPM, 4:39 | 7.06★

What's a good map collection without some high-star Eurobeat maps to jam out to? While there are hundreds of Eurobeat maps out there in the graveyard, the 260 people who have already favourited this map would agree that Taikuta's map of the song *Prayer* is one of the best ones out there.

The map reaches a length of almost five minutes and is filled with flowy alt patterns at 160 BPM. Not just any alt patterns, though: these are the kinds of patterns that you hit and think to yourself, "that felt good." That might sound like fun and all, but if you really want to know what it's like, check out the map for yourself!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-06-21-project-loved-june-2020/osu/3-humanoid.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1092783)

[ZUTOMAYO - Humanoid](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/972298#osu) by [Meg](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1872496)\
159 BPM, 4:00 | 5.72★

Meg is a fairly popular mapper known for having high-quality jump maps, but their high 5-star collaboration with Tsumia of *Humanoid* showcases their ability to make super enjoyable alternating maps as well. The map is 159 BPM and features many intricate alternating patterns, sliders, and finger control.

Over the two years since this mapset was submitted, it has garnered over 350 favourites and was even featured in the official osu! World Cup 2019. If you'd like to see what all the hype is about (and maybe add the map to your own favorites!), download the map for yourself and have some of the fun!

[AAAA - Accumula Town](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/942641#osu) by [\_Sylveon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9055922)\
112 BPM, 1:45 | 1.28★ – 6.27★

With all the intensity that can come from osu! beatmaps, sometimes we just need a little break to chill out. That's where mapsets like \_Sylveon's *Accumula Town* come in: it's a full spread of seven difficulties ranging from 1 to 6 stars, all mapped to an extremely peaceful song. The full spread of difficulties makes this mapset approachable for all kinds of players, so no matter where your skill level lies, you'll definitely be able to enjoy this mapset!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-06-21-project-loved-june-2020/osu/5-code-crimson.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1092781)

167 BPM, 1:59 | 6.72★, 7.12★, 7.99★

Has anyone been craving some technical spaced streams? I know I sure was—until I found this mapset, at least. This 3-difficulty mapset ranges from 6.7 to 8 stars, and each difficulty is filled with super satisfying 167 BPM spaced streams and finger control patterns. It's the perfect mapset to both train and refine your skills, all while trying not to get lost in the intensity of the song.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-06-21-project-loved-june-2020/osu/6-something-good-08-radio-edit.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1092780)

[Utah Saints - Something Good '08 (Radio Edit)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/456463#osu) by [xDololow](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4687216)\
129 BPM, 2:40 | 7.09★, 8.14★, 8.40★, 8.98★

It's hard to find quality maps that challenge you with symmetrical patterns the way xDololow's mapset of *Something Good '08* does, as it features three difficulties between 7 and 9 stars that each feature unique stream jump patterns at 129 BPM (that's 258 BPM jumps!). This mapset has already been in the hands of countless top players, and it's time for you to give it a shot as well. Give yourself a new kind of aim challenge with any of the three difficulties in this mapset.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-06-21-project-loved-june-2020/osu/7-mc-mental-at-his-best.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1092779)

[MC Mental - MC Mental at His Best](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/407055#osu) by [Bullhax](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3708657)\
176 BPM, 1:51 | 4.53★, 5.14★, 5.90★, 6.42★, 6.44★

*MC Mental at His Best* stands out as one of the most long-standing mapsets that has spread lighthearted joy among players ever since its submission in 2016. With over 240 favourites already on the mapset, Bullhax's mapset of this silly 176 BPM song features three completed difficulties between 5 and 6 stars. The maps themselves feature a mix of jumps, streams, and finger control, so it's the ultimate mapset to train different skills while simultaneously challenging the ultimate MC Mental.

[Zekk & SANY-ON - Amazing Sampling Showcase](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1134079#taiko) by [Mew](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2345156)\
140 BPM, 5:24 | 5.96★\
*description written by [jyake](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9099822)*

This map by Mew is the definition of clean, capturing the essence of drum-based rhythm gaming. No patterns feel out of place; no over-mapping fills the gaps. Although complex streams and crazy technical 1/6 is fun, I would personally like to emphasize how much fun it is to hit notes that feel like part of the music.

Mew captures this style of mapping perfectly, with the combination of drum-like mapping and smooth SV that hits just right. This is a very polished map that rewards the player for feeling the beat.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-06-21-project-loved-june-2020/taiko/2-energy-night.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1092776)

156 BPM, 2:16 | 5.59★, 5.98★, 6.06★\
*description written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

As a consequence of the new monthly format of the Loved section, we decided to showcase the winners of mapping contests done inside the osu!taiko community to highlight those amazing maps that were worthy of winning their categories! This time, we're starting with the osu!taiko Argentina Mapping Contest #2, which had *KAH - energy night* featured for the people in this community to compete.

In 3rd place, the now battle-scarred mapper Axer gave us a clear example of what a quality map looks like: overall clean patterning, tasteful placement of just enough SV to emphasize his mapping without going crazy, and the usual 1/4+1/6 patterns that are the flavour of our times.

In 2nd place, one of Argentina's newer mappers, juanilp4evr, managed to create a map of truly fine craftsmanship, with slightly wilder SV usage compared to Axer and a more techy approach to the song, leading to a really fun map that truly deserves to be in the top.

Finally, in 1st place, \_MMMMMM_MMMMMM\_ (A.K.A. un-plugged) snatched the win with a creative usage of SV and the clean pattern usage, and he topped it off with his usual gimmicks which have slowly become part of his identity as a mapper. We want to congratulate the winners of the contest for their excellent maps, and also encourage the rest of the community to reach for us in case you too want your contest map featured in the Loved voting!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-06-21-project-loved-june-2020/taiko/3-adcar.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1092775)

[Terminal 11 - Adcar](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/972116#taiko) by [Ulqui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1263669)\
240 BPM, 2:50 | 9.04★\
*description written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

Terminal 11's *Adcar* is an incredibly hectic song with an indescribable feeling that Ulqui somehow managed to materialize in his map: there's fast paced streams, incredibly tricky patterns and a relentless difficulty that will squeeze every drop of your skill if you want to get even close to pass it. And so agreed the folks that select the map pools for osu!taiko World Cup, as it was featured in the Grand Finals of TWC 2020 as a NoMod pick, where the finalists had jaw-dropping performances (and an especially unbelievable performance by applerss, who managed to get an FC against UK).

Hopefully, with this addition to the Loved section, we will continue to see incredible scores being made on the leaderboards!

[ZYTOKINE - Dancing Dollz feat. cold kiss - REDALiCE Remix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/801848#fruits) by [Rocma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276) et al.\
175 BPM, 3:41 | 5.80★ – 8.49★\
*description written by [Wesley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2407265)*

Rocma once again returns to the Loved section, but this time, it is not just Rocma. Rocma has created quite a cool project where not just one or two mappers create a difficulty, but a total of 9 mappers! Because each difficulty is mapped by a different mapper, it gives the whole mapset a nice touch with the variety of patterns all the different difficulties provide. Make sure to give every difficulty a chance, as every difficulty is truly unique!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-06-21-project-loved-june-2020/catch/2-kakuzetsu-thanatos.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1092772)

[Rohi - Kakuzetsu Thanatos](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/706413#fruits) by [\[\_-Kukkai-\_\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7811952)\
200 BPM, 3:32 | 7.17★\
*description written by [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)*

Even though this was mapped long before Rohi became a Featured Artist in osu!, this is a good time to both celebrate the occasion and show the community what a great map \[\_-Kukkai-\_\] made. If you follow osu!catch mapping, then you are probably already familiar with his mapping style, as he is a very active mapper. Compared to his Ranked maps however, his unranked stuff usually goes beyond the ranking criteria and he presents you a lot of patterns that test your abilities.

In *Kakuzetsu Thanatos*, he utilized a lot of fast-paced patterns with strong hyperdash usage. Furthermore, there are a handful of patterns that are difficult to keep a high accuracy on due to antiflow and strong hyperdashes which require good catcher control to be caught properly. All in all, this is a fun map which truly deserves more attention.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-06-21-project-loved-june-2020/catch/3-yuyushiki-of-nights.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1092771)

[YuZXs - Yuyushiki of Nights](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/238767#fruits) by [Badis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/559308)\
180 BPM, 2:51 | 5.70★, 5.70★\
*description written by [Sartan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4100941)*

So there's nothing wrong with a little bit of humour every once in a while, right? After about a 14 month wait, we introduce another Badis map to the Loved section: *Yuyushiki of Nights*. This is a fairly dated map now, having been mapped at the end of 2014. Back in those older days, it used to be a frequent multiplayer pick. Despite being old, it doesn't feel all too dated when you play it. The map structure does feel a little weird due to the map accentuating the vocal lines primarily over the instruments; you'll see what I mean when you try it.

And try it out you should! It is not the hardest of maps, and the map has two difficulties with different approach rates, making it accessible to most players. So don't let those lovely animated girls wait in the background, give 'em a bit of love too and check out this map!

The \[Salad\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [Yumeno Himiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1806962)*

Spectator and Minato Yukina have always been good pals in collaborating on awesome osu!catch maps. As two of the best catch mappers, their productions are always high quality, and *No Poi!* is no exception. This map is pretty relaxing and enjoyable with solid mapping styles as well as the awesome hitsounds, and the flows are just as good as other delightful maps created by these two mappers. *Is the Order a Rabbit? BLOOM* is also going to be on air soon, so stay tuned for the cute anime girls and enjoy the GochiUsa maps!

[DJ Sharpnel - Over The Fullereneshift](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/893066#mania) by [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707)\
224 BPM, 4:26 | \[4K\] 4.62★, \[4K\] 4.95★, \[4K\] 5.35★, \[4K\] 5.73★, \[4K\] 6.06★

First in line is a valiant call for salvation. Spare none of an amendment is long-time Loved patron Shoegazer's rebuild of *Over the Fullereneshift*, with cleaner jumpstreams, airtight patterning, and masterful repetition–as with the precision in brand name that Shoegazer tends to carry.

The chart features much difference in approach from the traditional OtFS, with a greater yet subtler focus on musical detail and intricacy. Its cleanliness lends itself nicely to player practice, with its different rates providing adequate coverage as challenge for the many keen-eyed players out there.

Contrary to its name, You Can (sometimes) Redo, and it's clear Shoegazer's call has sufficed.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-06-21-project-loved-june-2020/mania/2-gympie-gympe.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1092767)

[QUIL - Gympie Gympe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/560952#mania) by [Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082)\
242 BPM, 2:23 | \[4K\], 4.98★ – 6.50★

Repetitive musical motifs and the subsequent deliberate usage of repetitive patterns seems to be a trend for the first two charts in osu!mania's Loved nominations, with the second being Valedict's *Gympie Gympe*! The chart is a relatively slow jack chart, with the jacks clocking in at 115 BPM, that uses the repeating and developing sounds to push the jacks' density further and further as the chart progresses. This makes playing through not only satisfying, but also allows for the intensity of the play to increase as much as possible until the very end of the chart, making it extremely engaging no matter the skill level of the player.

Not only this, but the mapset comes with many extra difficulties with higher rates, making it a great practice chart for people looking to improve their jacks, and a great challenge chart for the top-end players to show off their skills. Ultimately, *Gympie Gympe* became very popular as a result of these things on osu!mania and StepMania/Etterna, and has dug itself a fitting spot among the Loved nominations.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-06-21-project-loved-june-2020/mania/3-warriors.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1092766)

[Hommarju - Warriors](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/376832#mania) by [ALEFY](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1291769)\
128 BPM, 2:01 | \[4K\] 3.29★, \[4K\] 3.29★

Up next is an extremely simple nomination, but one that has gained an immense amount of popularity since its upload. The map is ALEFY's *Warriors*, a staple of his SV maps that heavily utilizes red line gimmicks. The main draw of the map comes in its choruses, where this usage of red lines is most obvious: instantaneous teleports and 0 BPM lines create a seamless, sudden appearance of following notes and make for an interesting experience similar to that in [maskeara](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2393914)'s Loved set of *[POSSESSION](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/551469)* set.

It's no wonder that *Warriors* gained the following it has today given these simple, yet very enjoyable SV gimmicks that keep players coming back. This makes it a clear shoo-in for Loved.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-06-21-project-loved-june-2020/mania/4-chaosmaid.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1092765)

[paraoka - chaosmaid](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/533893#mania) by [shuniki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4942174)\
189 BPM, 3:52 | \[4K\] 5.01★, \[4K\] 7.69★

A familiar face in the Loved section, shuniki returns with *chaosmaid*, another fun and challenging long-note community favorite. Like shuniki's other LN maps that were previously nominated for Loved, *chaosmaid* is a staple LN map for all those LN fanatics out there. It's a relatively straightforward map when it comes to shuniki, with its simplistic, repetitive structure executed in a smooth and satisfying manner.

At 189 BPM, the map contains dense long-note inverse jumpstream patterns, followed by minijacks and almost rude SV transitions. In the middle section, the gaps between the long notes shrink, making it very necessary for the player to concentrate especially hard, as this section is very difficult to read even in comparison to the inverses. After this, the buildup and chorus repeat themselves, with slightly smaller gaps in the buildup, coming full circle at the end.

Overall, it is not surprising that this chart has become so popular among LN players, as it presents a challenge in many different sub-skillsets of LNs. But not only that, the patterns are very smooth and fun, making for an enjoyable experience. With its approachability, popularity, and fun, there's no question that *chaosmaid* deserves a spot in Loved.

155 BPM, 6:48 | \[6K\], 5.01★ – 7.00★\
The \[(Marathon)\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.

This time, we're having a non-meta round starting off with a 6K pack from Alipay! This pack is geared towards players looking for a decent challenge, and this pack delivers a wide variety of patterns with stamina (*Back to the Gate Openerz*), technical (*L*), speed (*Mario Paint*), chordjack (*Can't Take My Eyes Off You*), and hybrid (*Licca*) charts with a few SVs (*Persephone*) thrown into the mix. Try them out and you might find a new favourite!

[Dormir - Watagumo no Onaka](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/539982#mania) by [Todestrieb](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4056690)\
165 BPM, 1:52 | \[9K\] 1.18★, \[9K\] 2.06★, \[9K\] 3.17★

The second non-meta pick for this round is a 9K spread from Todestrieb. Combining technical accuracy with precise keysounds, *Watagumo no Onaka* provides the players another fun experience with the underappreciated keycount. The spread in play also allows for beginners to have a try at 9K. The major selling point is the EX diff, which showcases some very solid structure and consistency with the music. For anyone itching for a 9K pick, this is one definitely worth trying out!
