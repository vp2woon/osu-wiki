We're proud to welcome **Millhiore Firianno Biscotti** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-04-01-new-featured-artist-millhioref/header.jpg)

In a new partnership many years in the making, we've finally managed to convince the representative suzerain of the Biscotti Republic into becoming our latest (and possibly greatest) Featured Artist.

With us from pretty much the beginning, **MillhioreF** rose to prominence in the osu! community as one of the game's foremost experts on *Easy* mod plays. To everyone's surprise, he also turned out to be a folk music sensation in the wings, taking the osu! community by storm with his smash hit, *Waltz o' the Irish* in late 2013.

Making waves as one of the first music artists ever to map their own work (a trend started by the well-beloved [tieff](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=tieff) with [*Sound of Night*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/15952#osu/57439)), **MillhioreF**'s trailblazing contributions to the mapping and music scene was a natural next step for us in our pursuit of the most featured of artists, and thus was our partnership born.

We proudly present to you, a selection of some of the finest music you'll ever hear:

As usual, all of the above are available right now from [**MillhioreF**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/727), pre-timed and ready for you to fail miserably in replicating [the objective brilliance that made him popular in the first place](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/73348), which by the way, is now Loved. People like to say 'it never hurts to try' but really, you're only going to hurt yourself if you try in this case, so don't bother.

The hint guessing game this time was... astonishing, to say the least. Avid tweeter @jehlpxyz attempted some reality-warping investigative juju that nearly turned our beloved **MillhioreF** into an award-winning British power metal band, but this was stopped just in time by one of our twenty-seven interns tweeting out the counter-chant. Lucky save!

We were so impressed by this herculean feat that we tracked down the person who owns the account and identified them as [jehlp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7568542), who we have now conscripted into the Beatmap Nominators. It goes without saying that such a galaxy brain cannot be allowed to exist outside of the BN for the safety of us all.

In other news, we've decided to double-up this week's release for *reasons*. Check back in a day or two for another highly vaunted Featured Artist release to tide you over, if for some reason the world's greatest folk musician just isn't enough for you. Keep an eye on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) during the week, because we've got a lot going to kick off the month, including art contests and more!

*(The above newspost and MillhioreF's temporary addition to the Featured Artist roster was our April Fools 2020 joke.)*
