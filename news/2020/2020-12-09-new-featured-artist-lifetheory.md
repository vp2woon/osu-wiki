**Lifetheory** joins our Featured Artist lineup as our latest addition, and that's a fact!

Fusing a whole slew of genres into something new and wonderful, **Lifetheory** is an insanely talented Russian producer sporting a similarly wide range of musical influences. Drawing elements from the likes of *Pendulum*, *Hanz Zimmer* and *Linkin Park*, his music effortlessly strides into aural territory rarely tread.

With **19** new tracks now available, there's no shortage of epic electronic experiences waiting in the wings, so why not give some a try?

In case you weren't with us yet when the **Lifetheory** craze was at its peak, check it all out in a little medley style preview below, courtesy of the most pishi of fats:
