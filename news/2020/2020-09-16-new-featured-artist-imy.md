**Imy** brings a new flavor of Japanese rock to the Featured Artist lineup!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/99/header.jpg)

Weaving cinematic Japanese rock tunes with that quintessentially 'anime' sound since 2014, **Imy** is something of a sleeper hit that we're excited to introduce to you all.

He's performed alongside artists like *ELFENSJóN*, *Eri Kitamura*, *Maon Kurosaki* and a whole load more, plus has had his work featured in projects like *Digimon Adventure tri.* (where you might recognize the OP *Butter-Fly*), the *SOUND VOLTEX* games, *PXZ2* and *Crossbeats*.

We've got a sizable collection of **24** tracks from him now available, sure to scratch that J-rock mapping itch for some of you, if the uptake from the ever-talented Mappers' Guild has been anything to go by!

Check out a few previews, plus some new showcase maps:

You know how this goes by now - all of the above plus a whole bunch more are available from [**Imy**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/99) pre-timed and straight up ready for your creative input, so what are you waiting for?

Tweeter @JoeCastleVen nailed this week's hint in full with a complete explanation, scoring full marks. Just in case you didn't see it, the hint combines together to refer to **Imy**'s track "Ray of hope", for which there is a very recent showcase set that bears 'Resolve' as the top difficulty. @Kazegaaa came in very close shortly afterwards, with @\_Kiranaide, @ShinyRay\_, @P1Twist, @Fluorine_osu, and @DatVeno trailing just a bit behind. It wasn't an easy hint this week, so to see people go the extra mile is wonderful!

The big triple digit release is slated for next week, and it is going to be epic. Why? Because all of our Featured Artist releases are epic, and this one's going to be no exception! 100 is just a number, so don't dial your hopes up too high for a certain draconic artist (hint: it isn't them), but do keep your eyes and ears peeled for something we're sure you'll enjoy.

Until then, keep tabs on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for all the news you're sure to want to know. See you next week!
