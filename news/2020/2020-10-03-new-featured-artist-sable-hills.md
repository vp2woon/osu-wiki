Japanese metalcore sensation **Sable Hills** rolls on in as our latest Featured Artist!

Shredding their unique style of metal since 2015, **Sable Hills** is formed from the combined talents of the Mishima brothers, Yuto Fujimiya and Keita Kondo.

Inspired by the likes of *As I Lay Dying*, *Unearth* and *In Flames*, kindred metalheads are sure to find something fresh and new in their distinctive take on the scene. They've been compared to *BLOOD STAIN CHILD* and *GYZE*, and we're sure you'll see why once you give them a listen!

We've got **12** new tracks now available from across two of their albums (including their latest, Flood), and the Mappers' Guild has been hard at work welcoming **Sable Hills** aboard with a brand new osu!taiko showcase set to churn the waters and whet the ravenous appetites of the *very* prolific metal mapping scene that we know thrives.

Check out a sample of what we've got below:
