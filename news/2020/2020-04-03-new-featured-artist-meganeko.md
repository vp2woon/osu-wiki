**meganeko** joins our lineup as the latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/75/header.jpg)

Another name dashing in from geometric beginnings, **meganeko** is a Swedish producer most known in the rhythm gaming scene from people going absolutely wild with his track *Milkshake* in the *Geometry Dash* community. Beyond that, he's also created tracks for games like *Slime-San* and *Project Arrhythmia*.

We've assembled a collection of **26** tracks from across his entire discography for your mapping adventures, spanning chiptune, EDM and even more cyberpunk-inspired progressive marvels. The more perceptive among us may have even heard some of these tracks featured as BGM in the osu!taiko World Cup streams recently!

This includes a selection from his latest album [*Eclipse*](https://meganeko.bandcamp.com/album/eclipse), which we were extremely privileged to get a sneak peek of many months back.

On top of that, the Mappers' Guild has been hard at work producing a few osu!catch preview sets for his work, all ready for you to sink your teeth into in preparation for the osu!catch World Cup. If you've never given osu!catch a try, there's no better time!

As usual, all of the above plus so much more are available now over at [**meganeko**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/75), pre-timed and awaiting your creative touch. Those interested in creating longer-form maps might want to check out *Empyrean* and *Velocity* in particular!

Congratulations to tweeters @Duskyui, @Amateurre45, @Fknea and @ent_twit for correctly guessing this week's hint! @Duskyui in particular was extra close - astronomic refers both to his latest album (Eclipse) and is also synonym for 'mega', whilst feline refers to cat, which is 'neko' in Japanese. It wasn't a hugely difficult one granted, but there were considerably less people going for the name of a certain top player than we thought there'd be.

This week was a little bit special with our "double" release, but we'll be back to normal next week with another new artist for you to enlighten your ears with. Keep tabs on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for more details!
