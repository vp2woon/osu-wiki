**Venetian Snares** is the latest producer to join our **Featured Artists** lineup!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/71/header.jpg)

An undisputed master of the majesty that is eclectic sampling and sheer experimentation, **Venetian Snares** is a widely renowned artist most famous for pulling back the veil on breakcore as a genre, introducing it to the broader tastes of the electronic music community with his album *Rossz Csillag Alatt Született*.

It is no surprise that an artist so focused on rhythmic layering would find his work embraced by osu! mappers, especially with our vaunted history of tracks from the likes of *goreshit* and others.

We're proud to welcome **Venetian Snares** aboard with a cursory selection of **8** tracks from across his entire body of work, encompassing the broad selection of beatmaps made by mappers like [fergas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3144542) and [Blue Dragon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048) (now Mismagius).

Check out a sample below:

Congratulations to Twitter users @neeeeeeeeton, @uwumintyyy and @itsraechel for correctly guessing this week's hint, with @itsraechel in particular snagging the whole thing in full with an explanation. We haven't had a hint guesser this big-brained since fieryrage happened a few weeks back!

New week, new artist. Keep your eyes on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for another mid-week hint and more delicious osu!-related news for you to sink your teeth into. Rumors are floating around that something big is brewing in the mapping scene, but whatever could it be...
