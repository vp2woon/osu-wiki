Make some noise for our latest Featured Artist of EDM fame, **Noisia**!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/84/header.jpg)

When the Netherlands-based trio of Nik Roos, Thijs de Vlieger and Martijn van Sonderen aren't making waves in the electronic music scene as the maverick act known as **Noisia**, they're creating tunes for big-name games like *Devil May Cry* and *DJ Hero*.

Turning heads and taking names since 2000, we're super excited to welcome **Noisia** aboard with a small selection of some of their recent original works. If you're not familiar with them from their work, you've undoubtedly heard some absolutely filthy bass inspired by their musical mastery.

Don't take my word for it, check them out:

All of the above plus a whole bunch more are available right now from [**Noisia**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/84), so head on over and get your fill of sick bass in a neatly packaged, pre-timed format filled with love from your local pishifat. It's like a packed lunch except musical.

Crumbs! Too many people guessed the hint this time around, but it is hardly surprising given how popular Noisia's stuff has been. @StarrStyx gets the primo mention for being the first to jump on the proverbial ball. Good stuff.

We've still got a big updates release hiding in the wings awaiting the finalization of some legalese stuff. Once it's all ready, we'll be dropping it with basically no warning, so keep your eyes on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for more details!

Until then, go forth and enjoy!
