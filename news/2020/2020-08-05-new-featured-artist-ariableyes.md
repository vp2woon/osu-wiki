Spinning stories of tragedy, **Ariabl'eyeS** arrives as our latest Featured Artist!

A long-lived and well-loved cult pick among the upper end mapping scene, **Ariabl'eyeS** has been making waves in Japan since 2011 and in the osu! community since 2015.

A three-woman gothic metal doujin circle, the enigmatic trio has made regular appearances at Comiket and M3 to widespread critical acclaim, and today their legacy continues on in osu!.

**52** new tracks from across their entire discography are now available, including popular classics like *Kegare Naki Bara Juuji* and more.

As you've all come to expect by now, the above plus a whole bunch more (seriously, go take a look) are available right now all pre-timed over at [**Ariabl'eyeS** Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/93). We're talking over 10+ albums here, people!

Ace hint detective @mirthillee snagged this week's hint with flying colours, picking apart the reference with ease, though we wonder if perhaps the WhiteCat extra made it a bit *too* easy. Honorable mentions go to @drewdeowo, @AuroInOsu and @Vulkin_U for getting there as well, though with some... questionable reactions from the former.

Our commitment to bringing you new artists both familiar and fresh each and every week remains steadfast. One might even think we're doing something ridiculous like gunning for the largest library of rhythm-game ready music available to create with, or something. In any case, check out [the @osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for your weekly fix of everything officially osu! related, including upcoming Featured Artist hints, contests and more.

Until next week, enjoy!
