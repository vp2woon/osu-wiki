We're proud to pull back the curtain and welcome **MIMI** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/77/header.jpg)

Brought to prominence in osu! by [one intrepid user's efforts](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4378277) in the past year or two, **MIMI** is a Japanese producer and artist focused on working with the *VOCALOID* lineup.

Gathering nearly 15 million plays in total, **MIMI**'s sound is clearly a hit amongst the community, and we're stoked to bring them aboard officially with a selection of **10 tracks** from their discography.

Check out a sample below:

As per the usual, all of the above are available right now over at [**MIMI**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/77) pre-timed and ready for your creative touch. Make sure to check them out if you like what you hear!

The hint for this week came on short notice, but a fair people people guessed this one correctly! Congratulations to @nathankogal, @waferosu, @jimmyfung172 and @DedPiranha for being the first on the draw.

Fun fact, did you know that we have weekly releases stacked up now until the start of 2021? That's over 25 new artists waiting in the wings, and an official marker that 2020 will be the first year in which we exceed 100 total Featured Artists.

Make of it what you will, the train continues onwards regardless! Check the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) mid-way through the week for more hints and news that might interest you. With Aspire V in full swing and rumors of a big new mapping tournament making the rounds, it's going to be a great couple of months to spend some of that stuck-at-home energy on making maps to wicked tracks.
