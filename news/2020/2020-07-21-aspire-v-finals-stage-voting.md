You've chosen your favourite beatmaps from the Aspire V categories, now it's time to pick the best of the best!

[Last month](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-06-22-aspire-v-category-stage-voting), we asked you to pick your favourite boundary-breaking entries out of nine categories.

The results are in, but it's not over yet - the winners have moved onto the final stage of Aspire V.

In this final stage, the top two beatmaps of each category have been compiled into one final category, and the winning beatmap's creator will be forever immortalised as an Elite Mapper.

## Voting

The above beatmaps have been compiled into one final voting category, the Grand Aspire category. This time, you can vote for up to three beatmaps. Voting will be open for just **10 days** from this post.

We made some small errors in the previous beatmap packs, which have since been fixed. In short, we've removed some files which we felt weren't appropriate to keep. The entry from HomelyBobolink was also using a storyboard file from an older submission. These changes have been made in the beatmap pack below.

Congratulations once again to all of the entrants who have made it this far, and good luck for this final stage of voting! You'll need it.
