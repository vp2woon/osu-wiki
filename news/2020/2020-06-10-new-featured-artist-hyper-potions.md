Stock up on the healing tunes of our latest Featured Artist, **Hyper Potions!**

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/85/header.jpg)

Guaranteed to restore at least 120 hitpoints to anyone listening, [**Hyper Potions**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/85) is the name chosen by the American producer duo of Ian Tsuchiura (Sushi Killer) and Kevin Villecco.

If you're a Sonic fan or a connoisseur of rocket-powered vehicles slamming oversized balls into gigantic nets (Rocket League), you've probably heard some of their music before already, not to mention their contributions to various productions from *Cartoon Network*.

They're undisputed masters of high octane happiness, with a sound that is every bit as uplifting as it is energetic, and we're super excited to have choice selection of **10** tracks from them now available, including collaborations with other well-known artists such as our very own MYLK.

Don't take our word for it though - check out a few samples below:

This week's hint was decisively deciphered by tweeter @joe_boolin, who not only correctly guessed Hyper Potions in full, but also the exact explanation of the hint and its reference to the price of our newest artist's titular item in the Pokemon games. In their (very enthusiastic) words, VERY COOL! LET'S GO!
