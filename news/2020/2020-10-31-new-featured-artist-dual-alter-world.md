We're proud to welcome **Dual Alter World** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/111/header.jpg)

Featuring the talents of Kotori Koiwai (you might know her best from her roles as Renge Miyauchi from *Non Non Byori* and Elaine from *Seven Deadly Sins*) and RYU, the lead guitarist from *BLOOD STAIN CHILD* and *YUZUKINGDOM*, **Dual Alter World** is a brand new metal project with some serious musical and lyrical chops.

We've snagged **10** tracks from their debut album *Alter Ego*, which we're sure that the rabid metalheads among us will love.

On top of that, the ever-talented Mappers' Guild has created a new showcase set to get the ball rolling with some big name mappers involved, like Nao Tomori, Icekalt, Lasse and pishifat.

Check it all out:
