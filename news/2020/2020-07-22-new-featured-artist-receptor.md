We're excited to welcome **Receptor** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/91/header.jpg)

Popular in osu! during the 2013 era and beyond, [**Receptor**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/91) is a Russian electronic music producer most well known for his unique spin on drum-and-bass.

He's remixed tracks from *Black Sun Empire* and *Noisia* to considerable critical acclaim, with mappers like [fergas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3144542), [FCL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4715762) and [Natteke](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/157177) mirroring that same excellence within the osu! community as well.

**44** stonking new tracks are now available from across **Receptor**'s entire discography, all complete with his signature sound that you just can't find anywhere else.

Have a listen to a few previews below and see for yourself:

All of the above plus a HUGE amount more are available right now over at [**Receptor**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/91), so head on over and check it out! Everything is pre-timed and totally ready for you to start mapping, so what're you waiting for?

Tweeter @xMedi3 totally nailed the hint this time, closely followed by @Blue_Orby. Nice one! This week's hint referred to nerve and touch receptors, though clearly the astute among you had no problems figuring this one out. Fun fact - did you know that **Receptor** was a widely suspected answer to *ginkiha*'s release back in March? @M8gazine was on the right track, just a couple of months too early.

It has been quite a while since we've had a release quite so stacked in terms of sheer volume, whew. Keep tabs on next week's release and other osu! news you probably want to know over at the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/), especially since we've got so much going on at the moment.

See you next week!
