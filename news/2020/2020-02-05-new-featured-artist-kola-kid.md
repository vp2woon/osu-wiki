**Kola Kid** bursts into the scene as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/67/header.jpg)

Showcased in [Kert](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/119933)'s 2012 set for [*can't hide your love*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/39732#osu/126446) and again in [Bonsai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/987334)'s [collab set](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/489383#osu/1043092) for *press start* back in 2016, **Kola Kid** is the self-proclaimed Godfather of chiptune fusion.

With bleeps and bloops inspired by the video game BGM of yesteryear mixed with tinges of modern electronica, breakcore, punk and rap, his work is a unique blend of a bunch of stuff that just straight up *works*.

The Mappers' Guild has been hard at work creating a few sets to highlight exactly how the magic comes together in more modern mapping styles, piloted by the minds of [Mirash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2841009) and [ShirohaMyMommy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1603923) (aka: Delis).

Sound interesting? Check out a few samples for yourself below:

Like always, these tracks and a bunch more are available right now over at [**Kola Kid**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/67), all pre-timed and just waiting for you to press start. Head on over and get cracking!

There were a lot of correct callouts this time around, especially as the astute among us are starting to notice some *definitely not suspicious* patterns emerging. Big-brained frickin' *radar* technically wins this week's callout by correctly guessing nearly a week before the hint actually was released.

This isn't all that surprising given that he is also a Beatmap Nominator much like one of our previous winners, and has to have a cranium capable of housing at least one galaxy to avoid having his soul consumed by the Nomination Assessment Team. Whoever said modding wasn't hard work?

In any case, there's still no end in sight for this ridiculous schedule we've got going, so check in next week for another new artist to sink your musical teeth into. Give the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) a browse throughout next week to get in early on the hint, if that's your kinda thing.
