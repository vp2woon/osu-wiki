We're proud to welcome **cute girls doing cute things** aboard as our latest addition to the Featured Artist lineup!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/105/header.jpg)

Something of a passion project aiming to celebrate the identically named anime sub-genre, music and meme culture in general, **cute girls doing cute things** has enjoyed a steadily growing presence in anime-aligned music communities, having featured on *Waifu Wednesdays* in the past and attracted a considerable audience on *SoundCloud* ever since.

If you're fond of quintessentially sometimes sweet, sometimes funky and upbeat electronic tracks interwoven with snippets of Japanese vocals and soundbites, you're sure to like what **cute girls doing cute things** has on offer.

We've snagged **9** tracks that we think will work great in osu! for you to sink your teeth into, and the ever-talented minds of the Mappers' Guild are there to lead the way with a showcase map to get things started!

Check it all out:
