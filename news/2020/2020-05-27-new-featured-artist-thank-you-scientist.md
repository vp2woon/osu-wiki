**Thank You Scientist** adds some method to the madness as our latest addition to the Featured Artist lineup!

Our quest to encompass just about every genre and musical style continues this week with our latest snag, the seven-man wonderband that is [**Thank You Scientist**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/83).

Turning heads since 2012, the New Jersey-based septet is widely renowned for their eclectic sound that draws upon influences from dozens of genres and folds them all under the progressive banner.

Though a little bit longer than you might be used to, their work fills a neat niche which has historically been well-received, with mappers like [-Visceral-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1855540) (formerly known as Theaceae) and [Mun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6699165) turning heads with their map of [*My Famed Disappearing Act*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/765338) back in early 2018.

If you're a fan of English-based rock and have a soft spot for any of the different kinds of musical fusion subgenres, **Thank You Scientist** is sure to tickle your ears. Seriously, they're wicked stuff.

Don't take our word for it, give them a listen:

All of the above plus a whole bunch more are available right now over at [**Thank You Scientist**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/83), so make sure to check them out! Everything's all pre-timed as usual and just waiting for your creative touch. Give mapping a try!

Tweeters @Simon_Hodne, @tomatera_alt, @daiyouseidesu, @kazewindfold, @osusmh, @fiery\_\_\_, @sleepycynner, @VenoxiaOsu (again), @Rentra\_, @xspoes, @joshualox32, @ItsKarasmic, @dictatemusic (yes, the Featured Artist himself) and @Potato_Boy_123 all nailed this week's release not long after it went out. Big list this week, but well earned, especially with how excited all the above guessers were about things.

You might recall that last week we mentioned that there'd be a big update release later on and how that never ended up happening — unfortunately, some licensing shenanigans got in the way of that particular date, but we're confident that said release will be happening very soon, and it is guaranteed to include some great new stuff from names you know and love.

Keep your eyes on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for more details on everything you'd probably want to know about osu! stuff!
