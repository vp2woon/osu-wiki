We're proud to welcome the auditory artisans behind **Station Earth** and **Blue Marble** aboard as our latest combined Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/66/header.jpg)

Made famous in osu! by [Bearizm's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3495259) timeless set for [*Cold Green Eyes (feat. Roos Denayer)*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/371128#osu/814293), **Station Earth / Blue Marble** is the liquid-DnB fusion project from producer Matthias De Herdt and DJ Jelle De Maeyer.

Taking the chill and the hectic together and creating something truly excellent from it all, we're certain that you guys will love delving into **21** tracks new with all the classics you know and love from **Station Earth**, plus a huge sample of a more modern take in De Herdt's solo project, **Blue Marble**.

Check it out for yourself:

You know the drill, all of this plus so much more is available right now over at [**Station Earth / Blue Marble**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/66), all pre-timed and awaiting your creative spin. You never know, you might end up the next Bearizm. 20 million plays on a single set is no joke!

Congratulations to Twitter user @WitherStar321 who had the solution for our phone number hint on speed-dial, putting the correct answer out into the airwaves a paltry hour after we released it. We're clearly going to have to ramp up the difficulty to match your gargantuan megabrains.

We'll be back next week with another absurdly talented artist in the wings, so stay tuned to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for more pre-release hints and all that jazz. No, that's not a hint.
