We're proud to welcome **kiraku** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/101/header.jpg)

A growing name in the Japanese EDM scene, **kiraku** is an American-born producer with some serious musical chops. They've released work on *kors k*'s *S2TB Recordings* and had tracks featured in *KONAMI*'s *DanceRush Stardom* to critical acclaim. We think you'll love their varied, rhythmic sound.

We've managed to get **8** new tracks from them, including a brand new track first released on osu! titled *connection* which we hope you'll love. On top of that, the Mappers' Guild has been hard at work (as usual) creating some new showcase maps to bring **kiraku** in with style.

Check it out:

We're hope you're excited about this new release schedule for our upcoming Featured Artists as we are! To remind those who may have forgotten, we'll be releasing twice a week, once on Wednesday, and again on Saturday at roughly the same time of day.

Check back on Wednesday for another dope release, and until then, the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) is where you want to be if you want the latest news and tidbits!
