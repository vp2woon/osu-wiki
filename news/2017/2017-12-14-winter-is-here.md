The snows have truly settled in across most of the world, and with the results of the Winter 2017 Fanart Contest finally in, what better way to celebrate than with some incredible pieces of osu! art? And to top it all off, a brand-new Christmas-themed track from the original composer of osu!'s musical theme, *nekodex*!

2017's been a bit of a hectic one for osu!, and the latter half of the year is always the time where we kick back a bit and enjoy some well-earned chill.

With that in mind, the original osu!musician, [nekodex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102), has dug deep into his reservoirs of musical mastery to pluck out perhaps the most chill of all the holiday tunes yet - with "aureole", available now for your listening pleasure.

A relaxing walk through a wintry soundscape, "aureole" is an intimate symphony of warm, fireside tunes, elevated into majesty by a beautifully smooth woodwind lead, and finally capped off with glitchy, breakstep-inspired percussion.

This track will be a fixture on the main-menu to accompany the Winter seasonal background until Christmas has come and gone. You can download a 320kbps version for free from [nekodex's SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/nekodex/aureole) (or [this link](https://nekodex.net/dl/nekodex_-_aureole_\(osu!_xmas_2017\).zip) if you don't have a SoundCloud account), and if you're after a lossless download, name your price over at [his Bandcamp](https://nekodex.bandcamp.com/track/aureole-osu-xmas-2017).

And that's not all!

To accompany the brand new tune, we're delighted to announce the results of the Winter 2017 Fanart Contest - featuring perhaps the most intense race for first place of any contest that we've ever held thus far.

With **65** entries and only **6** votes per person to cast, the choice was as agonizing as it's ever been. But the community has decided, and they have told us loud and clear that merely 10 winners was simply not enough, so we have decided to take the top **15** winners instead.

Without further ado, here's a sneak peek at the winners - and remember, you can click the little banners to head to a full-size version of each picture!

Leading the pack by an absolute hair with **11,830** votes, [Leissss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4750716) blew the voters away with her take on Mocha doing the work of Santa Claus, looking out across the cityscape below from above a sea of candlelit lanterns.

This was by far and above the **CLOSEST** win of any first place Fan Art contest we've ever held. We've never seen anything like it before.

Taking third place with a breathtaking rendition of a winter-garbed pippi and Mocha together to boot(y) with **7,978** votes, [Sunako](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2801166)'s superb piece well deserves its place among the top, and also earns bonus credit for being one of very few entries to nail Mocha's design properly.

We mean the bangs and bandage, by the way.

Glittering with wintry glamour, [Hikerumin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7554335) colourful composition nabbed **5,108** votes, featuring both Mocha and pippi as the centrepieces of some absurdly pretty Christmas tree ornaments.

Warming things up a little, [Fye](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2362951)'s toasty depiction of pippi and Mocha enjoying some Christmas comforts before a fireplace banished the chill for **4,663** voters. Can we have the cat as a mascot too?

Enjoying a display of festive lights, [Sylux6](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2607507)'s scintillating piece of pippi and Mocha lit up the hearts of **3,866** voters. Official osu! Mocha-styled beanies, anyone?

Bringing all the major mascots to the table for the season, [YaoiForeva](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7959038)'s gorgeous greeting brought a smile to **3,224** voters, and earns a bonus mention for being one of very few entries to feature all of the official mascots, including the oft-forgotten Maria!

Shyly offering a festive gift, **3,203** voters gratefully accepted [JaX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3718989)'s frankly stunning rendition of a season-attired pippi in a snowy park. Honestly just spectacular, and I'm reserving writer's privilege here to say that this was one of my personal favourites. Superb.

Clad in a Christmas costume, [XFINCHIIX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7075621)'s pippi cuteness stole the hearts of **2,988** voters. If you look really close, her eyes glisten like stars!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-12-14-winter-is-here/vio.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/winter-2017/osu!%20Winter%20Fanart%202017%20-%20Vio.jpg)

And last but definitely not least, [Vio](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5661237)'s pastel celebration of pippi and Mocha is so unbearably cute that it scored **2,813** votes, and shows that wintertime doesn't necessarily mean colours go away!

It wouldn't be a Fan Art contest announcement if I didn't gush endlessly about how amazing the contest was this time around, but really, we've honestly never seen anything quite like this in all the years we've hosted them.
