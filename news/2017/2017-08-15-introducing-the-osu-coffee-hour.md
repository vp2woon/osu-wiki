## Introducing the osu! Coffee Hour

The osu! Coffee Hour will be a bi-weekly podcast-style talkshow on [osulive](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) featuring both staff and prominent community members. We'll be discussing anything from current events, to the future of osu!, to the mapping scene and much more.

**The best part?** The entire community gets to decide what we talk about!

## How does it work?

Every episode will have a general theme, a host, and anywhere from 1 to 3 guests, including both staff and community members related to the topic.

The biggest thing about the osu! Coffee Hour is that the hosts and guests set out to answer **your** questions about the topic at hand.

Post any questions on your mind regarding the topic or guests on that week's show below every osu! Coffee Hour episode announcement, and the most upvoted posts will be included and answered on the show by everybody involved.

## The first episode

As an introduction to the osu! Coffee Hour, we'll be starting out simple but strong. [HappyStick](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/256802) will be hosting the show, joined by none other than the game's lead developer, [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2).

Together, they'll be going over the current state of the community and the issues we're facing, as well as looking ahead at the future of osu! and what vision the staff holds going forward.

Have questions that tie into the theme? A question aimed at peppy himself? Ideas for future themes and guests? Make sure you let us know below!

**We'll see you this coming Friday the 18th of August at [11PM UTC](http://itsalmo.st/#osucoffeehourtime_5pm14) over at [osulive](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) for the first episode!**
