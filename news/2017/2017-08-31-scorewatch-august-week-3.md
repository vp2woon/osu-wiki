[kablaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3043603) takes the spotlight for this article as he stomps [dj TAKA - quaver](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/915210) with an earth-shattering HDHR 99.77% 2x miss score to earn his first 700pp score (exactly rounded up)! To think that he only got 1x 100 after all this blows our minds. This is incredible.

A score that was almost replicated 4 years back! [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) steals the 2nd spot on [xi - FREEDOM DiVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/129891) with an unbelievable 99.93% FC to take 538pp! Cue flashbacks to Cookiezi's 99.97% FC play back in 2013!

[Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) continues his dominance on this article as he sets the number one score on [xi - Ascension to Heaven](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/807074) with an unfortunate 98.98% 2555x 1 miss play to snag 637pp - an FC could have been worth more than 660pp! Will this map finally be conquered soon? Maybe it might, but in the meantime, you will have to check out this insane score!

[Motion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3885626) has taken the number one spot in osu!catch for the first time! To celebrate this, here is the man himself setting the an impressive 99.19% NC FC on [Hitsuji to Ojisan - XENO](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/663001) to claim 1004pp! Congratulations!

[EtienneXC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5610085) tears up [Evening's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2193881) [Imperial Circus Dead Decadence - FUBUKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1080145) by setting an amazing 99.65% FC. Standing at 4:14 mins of drain time, this play tests a player's control and stamina limits. With an accuracy like this, it's not doubt Etienne is one of the craziest 4K players out there today!

## BLAST FROM THE PAST

We blast ourselves back to 2015 where [rustbell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/227717), known for his technical ability in maps, took an amazing 99.57% HDFL FC on [IOSYS - Kanbu de Todomatte Sugu Tokeru ~ Kyouki no Udongein](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/16266) to earn 211pp. Honestly speaking, you have to see it to believe it.

Once again, do support [osu!archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/6uracb/osuarchive_4_rustbell_iosys_kanbu_de_todomatte/) (it is still ongoing on the osugame reddit) as they approach a week of amazing old scores!

## NOTABLE MENTIONS

The one and only [MinG3012](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1583218) is back as he sets a brilliant 58.12% HDHR FC on [marina - Towa yori Towa ni](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/793846?m=0) to earn 298pp. This is one crazy score.

Circle size 9.1? Not a problem for [Adamqs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/613592), securing a breathtaking 97.15% HDHR FC on [Moonbaby - Here We Go](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/371621) to earn himself 238pp. Frightening to watch, but what an amazing score it is!

[Flask](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/959763) may be a stranger to some, but he makes an appearance this week after he set a crazy 99.48% HDHR FC on [xi - Akasha](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/877312) to take 572pp and the number three spot, beating out Adamqs himself! What a way to get your top score!
