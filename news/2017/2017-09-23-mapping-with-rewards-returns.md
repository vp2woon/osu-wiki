New and improved, the open-form **Mapping With Rewards** mapping contests are back!

This article was posted in a similar fashion before, but we modified the conditions of the contest to make them more clear, and streamlined submissions by using the contest system!

**Mapping With Rewards** is a more open-ended approach to mapping contests first floated in [September of 2015](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/129936251068/mapping-with-rewards-sep-2015) with a simple premise: we offer a bounty for the best beatmap set of a [Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) song, and a big timeframe to complete it in.

Casual yet competitive at the same time!

With its return, Mapping With Rewards' simple premise now covers **all** gamemodes instead of just one!

## How does this all work?

It's very simple. We post post an announcement listing some songs, and from the moment it goes live, all of these songs have a *bounty* on them.

Any beatmap sets for this contest that are finished and ready for ranking within the conditions listed below are eligible to claim the bounty and enter the judging phase.

All that you need to do to flag your map as ready is to upload one version of it via the **[contest system](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/52).** You're also free to upload the map via the **[Beatmap Submission System](/wiki/Submission)** and give ranking the mapset a shot while the contest is running. When entry collection kicks in we will take the latest updated versions of the submitted entries where available.

If your entry is judged to be the best set among all those offered, the map is declared the winner for that its respective gamemode and you get to claim the bounty on the song.

With that out of the way let's get to the main part of this post: songs, bounties and conditions for claiming them!
