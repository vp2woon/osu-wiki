Two weeks in one! Things are getting settled after many of osu!'s biggest names return from the YACA meetup in China, but there's still sweet scores to be had. Another player has joined the 700pp club, a special SS set on a difficult osu!mania map, and much more in this special fortnightly edition of Scorewatch!

[_RyuK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6304246) has broken into the 700pp club! The number 1 Canadian set his mark on the famous map [kradness&Reol - Remote Control](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/774965?m=0) and taking an outstanding 97.76% HDDT 1 miss score to earn an amazing 704pp score! Well, I don't think I need to write much more for this score. Have a look!

An unfamiliar face to newcomers, but definitely a player that has not rusted a bit! [Niko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/175141) has come back strong with an amazing 98.59% S rank on [Tatsh - IMAGE -MATERIAL- <Version 0>](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/252238), taking the 7th only no mod S on this map, with an accuracy that even beat out [rrtyui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/352328) himself! What a comeback from this amazing player!

## BLAST FROM THE PAST

As osu! progresses into the 10th year of development, we look back at some scores set in previous years that we might have forgotten or missed, starting with [WubWoofWolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/39828) as he tears open [Bowling for Soup - 1985](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/19467) with a 96.46% DT FC!

We may not be able to keep up with what [jehlp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7568542) is posting at the moment, but do support what he is doing on the [osugame reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/6u2ufk/osuarchive_1_wubwoofwolf_bowling_for_soup_1985/)!

## NOTABLE MENTIONS

[WubWoofWolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/39828) has shocked the osu! community with an amazing play on [Halozy - Genryuu Kaiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/433005)! Slapping on the HD mod, he went on to take an incredible 99.15% HD 4 miss score to land 4th on the leaderboards and even earn 408pp in the process! Wolf at its finest.

Don't underestimate this play! [ThePooN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/718454) has just set a crazy 98.48% 13x miss 1797 combo score on the hardest 8.03* difficulty of [And Aoiyuuki - I love Flezlin](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/525461). Note that this map has big jumps (and not only) throughout the whole map!
