## What are the prizes?

The winning mapset of the contest as determined by popular vote will walk away with the following:

- 3 months of osu!supporter (for yourself, a friend, or many friends)
- The winning map will be featured by the osu! media team
- The winning map will be fast-tracked for ranking
- 25 mapping *Elite* points (details to be announced at a later date)

## What are the rules?

- All submissions must be for the **osu!mania** gamemode only.
- All entries within a submission must be for a **single keymode of your choice**, though we suggest either 4K or 7K to reach the maximum number of players. To clarify, this means either a 4K set or a 7K set - not 2 4K difficulties and a 7K difficulty.
- All submitted difficulties must adhere to the Ranking Criteria as closely as possible.
- You must map at least three (3) difficulties in an appropriate spread as per the Ranking Criteria. ENH (easy, normal, hard) or NHI (normal, hard, insane) are acceptable. *You may add an Expert or Extra difficulty if you wish when making a NHI spread for a total of NHIE.*
- No more than four (4) difficulties can be submitted under any circumstances, and ONLY if your spread is NHIX OR ENHI, otherwise you may only submit three.
- Collaboration is allowed, but the contest entrant will receive the points towards Elite status and feature prizes.
- Maps and entries submitted must not be uploaded to the BSS until the contest has concluded. Doing so will disqualify you immediately.
- Difficulty names must only be the name of the respective difficulty. Things like 'Evening's Moist Popcorn or 'jhlee's Jubilee are not allowed. You may use mode-specific/keymode-specific naming, like 4K NM, 7K EZ, so on, so forth.

The contest will run for **30 days** from the date of this post, so get cracking!

Good luck!
