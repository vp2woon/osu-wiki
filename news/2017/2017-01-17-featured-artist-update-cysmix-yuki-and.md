In our journey to continue feeding the creative mapping community of osu!, we have added **over twenty new tracks** to the Featured Artist catalog.

For those that aren't aware, the [Featured Artist catalog](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is a listing of artists who we are working with to bring a larger official library of songs to osu!, for use in tournaments, streaming and other events. Each one of these tracks has been selected by us for their mappability and provided to you - the mappers - in a pretimed template format for your convenience!

In particular, [**cYsmix**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/2) is delighted to share some songs from his most recent album release, titled [*Escapism*](https://cysmix.bandcamp.com/album/escapism), a bunch of brand new **osu!exclusive** tracks, a special osu! cut of *Babaroque* from the critically acclaimed [*Oracle*](https://cysmix.bandcamp.com/album/oracle) EP, and an assortment of suitably spooky tracks from his earlier 2013 album, [*Haunted House*](https://cysmix.bandcamp.com/album/haunted-house).

Head on over to **cYsmix**'s [featured artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/2) and check them out.

We've also got four new tracks from the much-loved [**Helblinde**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5)'s most recent album, [*Ephemerality*](https://helblinde.bandcamp.com/album/ephemerality). These thumping tracks are a bit longer than most people are generally used to, but in the way that only Helblinde knows how, he's managed to turn them into vivid scapes for mappers to eat their hearts out in. Or eat hearts in, perhaps. There's a nightmare or two hiding in some of those tracks, see if you can guess which.

Check them out at **Helblinde**'s [featured artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5). Don't miss out!

And lastly, the ever-diligent [**yuki.**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/4) has released another upbeat, fast paced tune that people are sure to love. Check it out over at [his featured artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/4).

If you love what these artists are doing, make sure to check out their site links on their listing profiles - they'll contain directions to their music sites (like Bandcamp, Patreon, etc) where you can purchase high-quality versions of these tracks and support the artists in their pursuits of musical excellence.

Keep your eyes peeled on the Featured Artist roster going forward - [**S3RL**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/9) and [**nanobii**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/10) are just the tip of the iceberg for now. We've got artists big and small lined up in the coming months. 2017's going to be a good year for mapping!

**tl;dr: 26 new amazing songs from [cYsmix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/2), [yuki.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/4), and [Helblinde](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5). Go map them!**
