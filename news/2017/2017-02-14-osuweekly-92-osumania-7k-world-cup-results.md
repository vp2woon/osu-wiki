**To the victor of osu!mania 7K World Cup go the spoils, but [TWC](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2017/) is just around the corner!** If you fancy yourself to be good at the arcade classic of beating on a drum viciously with your sticks of war, head on over to the [registration page](https://osu.ppy.sh/tournaments/9) and sign up now!

**The vg remix legend himself, Ben Briggs has joined our cast of featured artists!** Perhaps your own ill gained knowledge of memetics has already educated you on who he is. If you want to check out which of his works are available for use, or learn more about him, head over to his [artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/11) to get started! Would it surprise you if I told you we still have even MORE to come? Believe me when I say we are barely scratching the surface! Stay tuned for more throughout the coming months.

**Our loving father deadbeat has a new storyboard showcase for our eyes to feast on!** This time, it looks to be something a little more flashy than usual. I mean that literally! Watching this in the dark might not be such a great idea. Remember to always watch TV a good distance away from the screen and in a well lit room!

## Scorewatch: February Week 2 (With Scorewatch Patrol)

[[Toy]s our boy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4650315) managed to reverse choke [DragonForce - Defenders](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/718156?m=0) with a HR 98.41% 2427 max combo play, setting a 593pp score. This basically meant he lost about 72pp, which is absolutely heart breaking, but a very impressive score nonetheless. Only 3 players have managed a better HR accuracy than him, and 2 have a higher pp score. Check it out, it's nuts.

Hey, guess who also tried the same map? [Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493) of course! This man has had no breaks this year, and this play is nothing original. How about a HDHR 98.64% FC granting him 718pp? The man with a HDHR mission continues to dethrone many famous maps such as Defenders, and has solidified the crown on this map and overthrowing the 669pp HR play set by WubWoofWolf. Amazing.

[sobatsuyu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2076374) pulled off an interesting HRDT mod combination on [Resonecia - Legende](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/380524?m=1), setting an unfortunate 99.55% 1 miss play to earn him 554pp. Pretty "legendary" we'd say, since this map is long and full of deathstreams

Somewhere, far and deep into the osu! scores, [Tasha](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1031958) has managed to pull off a 99.59% FC on [Kobaryo - Ponko2 Girlish (Kobaryo's FTN-Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/562250). This 9.74* map is seriously technical based, with notes coming in fast and slow, requiring precision and accuracy. I'd say 1:11 is my favourite part of this play. Check it out.

[Ttobas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2084568) seemed to have forgotten how to play osu!catch as he went insane with a 99.64% EZDT FC on [Hitsuji to Ojisan - XENO](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/663001?m=2), scoring 745pp. Aim is pretty necessary when the BPM hits 279, simply outstanding in our eyes. I guess you could watch the fruits slowly fall everywhere onto Ttobas' plate.

===NOTABLE MENTIONS===

[Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493) can't control himself as he managed to HDHR FC [Seiryu - BLUE DRAGON](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/725718?m=0) on the BLUE DRAGON difficulty mapped by Blue Dragon with a 99.78% 687pp play. Pretty impressive we'll say.

[Angelsim](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1777162) left his quiet zone to set a 670pp play on [*namirin - Koi no Hime Hime Pettanko](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1053520?m=0) with a 99.29% HDDT FC.

[\_yu68](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6170507) came out strong with a DT 98.69% play on [Imperial Circus Dead Decadence - Uta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/899716?m=1) on lolcube's Hell Oni, setting 479pp.

[Zyph](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1600432) broke the speed barrier (kinda?) with a 99.93% FC on the 263BPM Loved [antiPLUR - Speed of Link](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/335798).

## osu!mania 7K World Cup: And then there were 2

The osu!mania 7K world cup scene has been commanded confidently by Team China since the return of competitive 7 key to our repertoire of yearly tournaments. The former champions, South Korea, has been edging to get another shot at taking down the superpower to reclaim their title as the country home to the greatest 7K players ever known.

In line with a series of domineering performances given out by the South Korean team, it looks like Team China will be vacating the throne as champions of keyboard grinding for a new king!

All podium placers will receive the usual physical goodies as well as split a prize pool that will likely be announced shortly.

With that out of the way, it is time to say goodbye once again! But don't cry, because next week deadbeat will be back to shower us with flowing juices from the fruit of knowledge. If you have anything you'd like to contribute to our lovely little publication, be sure to drop by the [osu!dev discord](https://discord.gg/ppy) and drop either me or deadbeat a highlight. Otherwise, our usual inbox, [news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh) is open and ready to take in whatever you have to throw at it!
