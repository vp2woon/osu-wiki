Huge plays from unexpected players, a low accuracy battle on IOSYS, and jakads going crazy once again in this week's issue of Scorewatch!

[Emilia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2003326) climbed into the top 10 with an amazing pp spree on stream, setting some crazy scores such as an amazing 99.10% 1x miss HDDT score on [HO-KAGO TEA TIME - Kira Kira Days](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/954692) to earn himself a whopping 744pp. His unique tap+x style has definitely proved its worth, and he is now sitting comfortably at 7th in global.

He isn't the only one to enter the 700pp club that day! [Yaong](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1883865) surged into the 11k pp club with an unbelievable 98.82% HR FC on [xi - Blue Zenith](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/658127) to score 707pp and taking the No. 2 spot on the map, taking the first modded FC on the FOUR DIMENSIONS difficulty. You have to watch this.

[Rucker](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/147515) definitely had [MinG3012](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1583218) (and [Axarious](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2614511) and [Epiphany](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3256299)) in his mind as he went on to take a somewhat unbelievable 16.90% NF FC on [IOSYS - Cirno no Perfect Sansuu Kyoushitsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/893739) to earn himself 118pp. So, when's the all 50 run? We will be waiting.

osu!catch World Cup 2017 winner [\[224\]Hyperw7](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4158549) definitely still has some adrenaline in his blood, unleashing the first HDHR FC on [onoken - P8107](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/686192r) with an amazing 99.88% accuracy to take 1158pp. So much patience was put into this, but it all paid off.

There are no brakes to what [jakads](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/259972) can do, sniping cheetose by a mere 90 points for the No. 1 spot on [Kurokotei - Galaxy Collapse](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/992512) and earning 685pp with his 99.91% play. It may not be the highest accuracy on the leaderboards, but it certainly is a really great score.

## NOTABLE MENTIONS

Seeing an S on [Inferi - The Promethean Kings](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1083470) is odd indeed, but not that odd for [-GN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/895581), stealing the limelight by taking the first FC, using EZHT to guide his way to a 98.68% FC to earn 388pp. The patience in this is remarkable.

A certain [Monstrata](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2706438) map, [xi - Glorious Crown](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/558694), was recently ranked, and as such, [Angelsim](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1777162) conquered the 2nd hardest difficulty in the mapset, scoring an impressive 98.54% HDHR FC to claim 552pp and the No. 1 spot. The final difficulty has yet to be conquered.

## SCORESHOW WITH ZSEIKIMATSU

[Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493) and [Gayzmcgee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1419095) battle it out on a stream test on the map [UNDEAD CORPORATION - Everything will freeze](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/552068?m=0).
