## Scorewatch: January Week 2 (with the Scorewatch Patrol)
Starting off this week's batch of scores, [Riviclia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1616533) has done the impossible by passing [The Koxx - A FOOL MOON NIGHT](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1126228) on the emillia difficulty with 83.13%. Littered with insane jumps during the chorus sections, the level of precision and speed required to land them is unimaginable, made even more impressive with his mouse-only playstyle. Check it out below!

[\_index](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/652457) has been spouting out impressive scores lately, but one play stands out far above the rest. His score on [HoneyWorks - Miraizu feat.Aida Miou(CV:Toyosaki Aki)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/306591), which is a DT FC with 98.63%, gave him 597pp. This map had only seen 3 FCs with the DT mod slapped on, but now the No. 1 Russian is its 4th. He also recently surpassed 11,000pp, so go and congratulate him on that! It's an astounding play.

[applerss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/983349) has gone even more nuts as he set the #1 score on the hardest difficulty of the newly Loved map [Laur - KILL KILL KILL KILL KILL](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/477119). With a record breaking 7x misses, this play is one of only a handful of no-mod passes, and the near-perfect execution of 330 bpm streams is truly a sight to behold.

We had a new No. 1 in osu!catch! Bring on [\[224\]Hyperw7](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4158549), who had finally ascended to king of osu!catch a while back by setting 2 impressive HR plays - [Halozy - GO 4 IT](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/833786?m=2) and [Dancing Dolls - monochrome(Asterisk Makina Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/997889?m=2), earning him 613pp and 789pp respectively. Both plays require steady and speedy precision, and the skin doesn't look half bad either. Check it out!

Amidst the chaos of the newly implemented DT pp system to osu!mania, which saw many mixed reactions between players, [jakads](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/259972#_general) became the first player to ever grab a 2,000pp score on [Yuuna Sasara feat. Tai no Kobone - Imperishable Night 2006](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/249346?m=3) on the 7K Lunatic difficulty with a 93.51% DT score worth 2,022pp. This map is really special as it is fully hitsounded and keysounded, so the sounds actually increase in pitch despite having the DT mod on. Check it out!

## osu!mania 7K World Cup Week 1: Keyboards will burn

![](https://puu.sh/sMSdZ/cc19cb0259.png)

**The most hectic portion of the osu!mania 7K World Cup has now concluded!** After what can only be described as an organized brawl, we now have a list of teams who will make it through into the brackets.Teams China, Chile, France, Indonesia, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States have all made their way from the bloodied mess into a series of 3v3 deathmatches.

**While the scores tell a story of utter destruction dished out by the American, Chinese, and South Korean teams, the real story of the week was in Group B** France, a previously unseeded team, managed to edge out Brazil, a top seed, to make it out of group stages. The match they had together fell decidedly in favor of France, winning with a solid score of 5-2. Group B also saw the ONLY tiebreaker of the group stages in the match between Chile vs Brazil. Despite taking the top stop in their group, Chile could not deliver the final blow as Brazil took the magical 5-4 win.

**The surprises don't end there!** While Russia didn't manage to create an upset on their own grounds, they have outdone anyone's expectations, even beating team Australia Unfortunately, in a battle that tested the skills of both teams, team Thailand managed to barely squeeze a victory past them, denying them passage into the next round of play.

**Perhaps to the surprise of no one, China and South Korea destroyed their competition and easily made their way through the formalities.** However, it would seem the clear cut victories are not as clean as we would have thought! Both teams Poland and Indonesia managed to take points off team China. Whether it's the team taking it easy in order to save their energy or not, it was certainly confusing to see some perhaps under-par performances on that end.

**Many people were not sure the Philippine team had what it takes to take down Singapore.** The two south-east asian teams were both not to be underestimated, with Singapore being the only team in the Group Stages to take a point off South Korea. However, when push came to shove, team Philippines stole away the show and will meet team USA in the next round. This will definitely be a match to watch out for, with both teams showing that they have the mettle to be a part of the final 16 teams standing.
