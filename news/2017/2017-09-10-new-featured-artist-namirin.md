Adored by much of the osu! community for her delightfully sweet voice and explosive popularity from her cover of Yowamushi Pedal's _Koi no Hime Hime Pettanko_, [**\*namirin (＊なみりん)**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/18) makes her entrance to the osu! Featured Artist roster with her latest mini-album, *5colors*.

Produced in collaboration with [gear_haguruma (歯車製作所)](https://twitter.com/gear_haguruma), *5colors* is an exploration of **\*namirin's** incredible vocal talent, with a wonderfully new yet familiar sound. We're delighted to share it with the osu! community as the first steps toward introducing her unique sound to the game.

We're excited to see what the intrepid mappers of our community will do with **five** brand new tracks that touch on the vocalist-heavy tastes that are something of a mainstay in the osu! mapping scene.

As with all Featured Artists, every track on [**\*namirin**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/18) comes pre-timed in an .osz and is 100% licensed for use in osu!, so worry less, and map more!

To build on this even more, we're excited to tease the return of an old contest-esque thing in the coming weeks, which will spotlight several of our Featured Artists, **\*namirin** among them.

Keep your eyes and ears peeled for more details as they come!
