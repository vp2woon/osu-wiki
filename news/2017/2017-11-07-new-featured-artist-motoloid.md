We're super excited to announce **MOtOLOiD**'s presence in the osu! scene as a Featured Artist label, bringing the expertise of four of their highly acclaimed producers with them - namely **baker**, **Hige Driver**, **Yuyoyuppe** and more.

You might recognise a few of these names already if you follow the scene, if you don't, you're bound to hear about them soon!

We have **nine** assorted tracks from **four** different artists available for your mapping pleasure, all free to use in osu!.

Here's a sample of a few, complete with maps already made and ready to play - simply click on the image to head straight to the listing:

A bridge into symphonic rock hits and a hint of metal, **Yuyoyuppe** of Vocaloid fame stretches his producing muscles to create something entirely new, and enthralling. Mapped by [**pishifat**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) - check it out [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/682286).
