If you're unfamiliar with this sort of thing, you may have already seen or noticed a few people wearing the [community contributor badge](https://assets.ppy.sh/profile-badges/contributor.png) on their profile. These respected individuals have at some point in osu!'s history, made massive contributions that have helped shape the game in a number of ways.

Today, we honour many more.

Do note, there are countless others who contribute massively - this list is by no means exhaustive, and merely represents an acknowledgement of massive, continued contribution over a long period of time as observed by members of the osu!team.

## Community

Occasionally, the osu!community is the host to people of incredible magnitude, who take it upon themselves to shape the direction of the game's future.

The contributors below are acknowledged as being some of the most formative individuals within their respective communities or projects, their work having helped make osu! better for everyone.

### OnosakiHito

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-12-24-community-contributors-2017/onosakihito.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128)

Instrumental in the genesis of the early osu!taiko community and mapping scene, OnosakiHito's contributions span across dozens of domains, ranging from the Charting Assembly Team, to the later production and management of the Beatmap Spotlights, prototyping and design work for the hush-hush Campaign mode, and an incredibly long, nearly gap-less tenure as a member of the BAT and now the QAT.

OnosakiHito has since retired from the QAT for a long-earned rest, but the sheer scope and depth of his contributions make this award something long in the running, and we are sad to see him step away.

### Deif

His contributions range from conceptual to organizational, such as building and reworking the osu!catch ranking criteria, setting up osu!catch modding queues, and even assisting massively with the running and maintenance of countless of World Cups across all modes.

Referee extraordinaire, there are only a few community-run tournaments that do not have Yazzehh's presence in them somewhere.
