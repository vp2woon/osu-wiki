[-GN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/895581) is back in scorewatch with another crazy play, this time on [ESTi - HELIX (Edit ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/462700), setting an incredible 99.68% FC to take the number 2 spot and 280pp! What else can we really say, this guy is on another level.

[Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) choked an 800pp play after he missed only once on [HoneyWorks - Akatsuki Zukuyo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/795627) with a 97.19% HDDT score to take 711pp. Without the miss, this score could have definitely given him the prestigious 800pp score!

[Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493) has another 700pp score in sight... that was what we thought when he decided to miss the last note of [Foreground Eclipse - From Under Cover (Caught Up In A Love Song)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/462386), setting a 99.32% HDHR 1x miss to earn 690pp. Intentional or not, he still remains top amongst the rest.

[_yu68](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6170507) has gotten the top pp play in osu!taiko in a cheeky fashion, by setting the first HDDT FC on hs own map, [D(ABE3) - MANIERA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/871924?m=1), with a fascinating accuracy of 99.19% to grab 792pp on the 10.31* difficulty! _yu68 is definitely a virtuoso!

How many times can [ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) show up in scorewatch? Too many times. He has managed to set an unbelievable DT SS on [9mm Parabellum Bullet - Inferno](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1099819?m=2) on the Overdose difficulty to take a whopping 1014pp. ExGon things.

## BLAST FROM THE PAST

Many players may not know how much of a beast [SapphireGhost](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/388602) was back in 2014, so here is osu!archive doing what they do best and picking his 96.99% HDNCSD FC on [Tomohito Nishiura - Theme of the Last Time Travel (Live)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/57143?m=0) to take 225pp and the number one spot on the map.

Once again, do support [osu!archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/70hytd/osuarchive_29_sapphireghost_tomohito_nishiura/) (it is still ongoing on the osugame reddit), more scores are being churned out as this gets published!

## NOTABLE MENTIONS

[Monko2k](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4852013) has surged up the rankings without a care after he set an amazing 99.71% HR 1x sliderbreak on [BABYMETAL - Gimme chocolate!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/970048?m=0) to grab 611pp. This unfortunate incident does not seem to hinder him that much as he has risen into the top 25 globally!

## SCORESHOW WITH ZSEIKIMATSU

[WindyS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1190879) takes on [cheewee10](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4477497) on the 6\* 7K map [m108 - \* Crow Solace \*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/354157).
