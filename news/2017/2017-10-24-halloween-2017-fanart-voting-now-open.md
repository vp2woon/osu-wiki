Rendering our beloved mascots in all of their terrifying Halloween glory, our community artists have really outdone themselves this year with an absolute assortment of impossible choices.

[Head on over to the contest listing page to vote now!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/56)

A selection from the top-most voted entries will make it into the game client as Halloween seasonal backgrounds, and each winning artist will also nab **2 months of osu!supporter** for themselves or a friend.

There's only a week from the date of this post to get your choices in, so make sure to be quick about it! Voting closes the moment All Hallows' Eve sounds. Spooky.
