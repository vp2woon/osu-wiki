## What has been changed?

- We are now using **ScoreV2** for osu!taiko in this tournament. With weighting combo and accuracy differently and altering parts of osu!taiko's gameplay elements, we want to rebalance competitive play. Visit the [discussion thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/550582) for details. This version is not finalized yet but will be ready in time for this competition!
- We have added clearer regulations regarding disconnects and inappropriate behavior during the matches.
- We have changed our prize pool to offer unique and exclusive merchandise to all of our podium winners, giving the winners something more special, rewarding and outstanding when competing against the best of the best.
- We adjusted the mappool structure and size. All pools are now of a size of **16** beatmaps in total, whereas **6** are in the NoMod bracket, **2** are in the Hidden HardRock and DoubleTime brackets respectively, **3** are in the FreeMod bracket and 1 is the tiebreaker of the pool.
- We have adjusted the ban amounts for balancing purposes. Teams may only ban **1** beatmap each per match now.
- By allowing Hidden+HardRock as possible mod combination in the FreeMod pool, mappools will now predefine allowed and disallowed mod combinations for each individual beatmap in the FreeMod pools.
- Along with opening up the new World Cup season, the graphic design has been renewed to give everything a fresh touch.

## Prizes

We plan to distribute exclusive and unique merchandise to all our podium winners in different tiers. The items are yet to be announced.

- 1st: unique item, profile badge, "osu!taiko Champion" user title
- 2nd: unique item, profile badge
- 3rd: unique item, profile badge

## How do I register?

- **[Click here to sign-up!](https://osu.ppy.sh/tournaments/9)**
- Do not create teams in advance! Teams will be formed after registration phase concluded by country's team captains.

Note that you can only participate if you are of a **osu!taiko global ranking of #5000 or higher and did not violate the [osu! community rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months**.

If your registration successfully passed our evaluation, you will be put on the candidate list of your country. Whenever a captain for your country has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.
