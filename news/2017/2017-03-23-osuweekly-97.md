**On the topic of Aspire 2017, [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) recently released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1xj0P9XOow) talking a bit about the history of the beatmapping contest.** The video goes over how the Aspire contests started and how they evolved throughout each rendition.

**We also got to the see the very artistic side of [r3venger](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4325601), a talented video editor in the community.** His most recent, and arguably most impressive work, looks at the [history of osu!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omyhkvy9yqg) and how it's evolved from both a development and communal aspect. The video was done in an 8-bit style with some amazing animations and a very creative mind. Definitely worth the watch.

## Scorewatch: March week 4 (With Scorewatch Patrol)

**[Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493) still proves his absolute dominance in the osu! Standard scene by pulling off a crazy HDHR 97.07% FC on [Kuroneko Dungeon - Ryoushi no Umi no Lindwurm](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/890911&m=0) on Vert's Extreme, giving him 423pp and the only HDHR FC and only FC without score reducing mods.** Simply mindblowing, then again, he is Cookiezi.

**A certain USA top player by the name of [kablaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3043603) recently returned to osu!.** Of course, he decided to set some scores, which included this amazing [ALiCE'S EMOTiON - Dark Flight Dreamer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/676172?m=0) HDHR SS (not to mention, 52 freaking UR), to earn himself 485pp and the 4th spot on the map, also becoming the 4th player to HDHR SS this difficulty, together with Wilchq, Yaong and Bikko. Check it out!

**[-GN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/895581) definitely came out top this week with his amazing 5 miss HD score on [Camellia - Exit This Earth's Atomosphere](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/517474#osu/1114721) mapped by rrtyui. His score sits comfortably at 2nd and also gave him 231pp.** Check it out!

**[ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) decided to take a swing at [Fleshgod Apocalypse - The Deceit / The Violation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/367631#fruits/974018) and set a 99.91% 5 miss score, hitting a peak combo of 3892.** Step aside Hypwer27 and Kyptoric, the 3rd no mod pass on this difficulty beats out both scores combined, with ExGon going past 600,000,000. Let's hope this shocking score won't bore you to death with 10 minutes of metal.

**[Deceitful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1396447) became the 2nd osu!catch player to get an HDHR SS on [Halozy - Genryuu Kaiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/253969#fruits/582801) (the 1st being ExGon), gaining a massive 898pp and the 2nd spot on the map.** The No. 1 Indonesian and Southeast Asian osu!catch player moved to 7th place with that score. Incredible stuff.

## TWC 2017 Week 2 Summary: Separation of the Brackets - with magnomizer

This week in the Round of 16, we were treated to 8 splendid matches between the 16 countries that remain in the tournament. While it was a shame that none of the matches were close enough for tiebreaker, the whole experience was intense nonetheless. Don't worry if you've missed out though, as you can always watch the VODs [here](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive/videos/all), or settle for a brief recap below:

Out of the 8 matches taking place on Sunday, half of them ended in 5-0 sweeps. From this, it is looking like Canada, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan will make it very far into the tournament, though nothing is ever certain in these things. The remaining matches were definitely more heated, and we are starting to see some teams fall behind as the mappool difficulty continues to ramp up.

The match between Germany and Malaysia certainly deserves mention. Against all expectations, Malaysia, something of the "dark horse" of the tournament managed to take the first point of the match against the top seeded Germany (granted, it was due to an untimely disconnection, but the point would still have been extremely close). Germany retaliated accordingly, evening up the score to 1-1. However to the surprise of everyone, the low seeded Malaysia stood strong, and took yet another point from their opponent. At this point, it was looking to be an extremely close match, but Germany found their footing and stormed through the rest of the match, resulting in a 5-2 victory. An impressive showing from Malaysia nonetheless - they are doing exceptionally well for a low seeded team, and they are a team to watch out for next week.

Two other matches worthy of note were Indonesia vs. Australia, and United States vs. France. The matchups were very close - both pairings were of roughly equal skill. After a fierce [clash of swords](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/554425#taiko/1173780) (or lack thereof), Australia and United States were the teams that made it out on top, knocking Indonesia and France down to the loser's bracket, where they will soon face against each other. Both teams will have to be well prepared if they want to remain in this tournament.

Next week in the winners bracket, we have a number of potential close and exciting matches. I predict Taiwan vs. Germany will be a very hard fought and close battle. Even more so for the match of United States vs. Australia. The remaining matchups look to be sweeps from Canada's and Japan's side, though having made it this far already, their opponents are clearly not to be underestimated.

The first match is scheduled to take place on Saturday 25 March, 18:00 UTC. This time, the stakes are raised even higher as half the teams are now at risk of being eliminated! With another 8 exciting matches to look forward to, be sure to drop by the [osu!live twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) this weekend, as you certainly do not want to miss out!

But that's all we have time for this week.
