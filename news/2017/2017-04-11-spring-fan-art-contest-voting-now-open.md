Talent is plainly in season this spring as the artists of the osu!community put forward the strongest showing in a fan art contest we've seen so far. [The votes are now open](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/45), so go and make yours count!

Anyone with any sense of artistic appreciation is going to have an absolute nightmare trying to choose only **three** artworks to vote for. We'd apologize, but we're too busy having our pants blown off by the turnout for this contest.

The top 3 winners will receive extra osu!supporter prizes (6, 3 and 2 months respectively), while the top 10 works will be displayed proudly on the main-menu in the game client, and will also net their artists a month of osu!supporter for their efforts.

[Head on over to the voting page now!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/45)
