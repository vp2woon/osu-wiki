Many impressive first-ever-done scores on maps like BARUSA of MIKOSU, a lot of EZ and DT mod action, several first places, a taiko scoreshow and more in the final issue of Scorewatch for June!

[Yaong](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1883865) entered the 600pp club in style with the first ever FC on [DragonForce - Soldiers of the Wasteland](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/962194), taking a 99.81% no mod FC to earn 639pp. Unbelievable consistency and accuracy from the Korean, this is a must watch!

[Mafham](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3660531) may have just set one of the craziest EZDT plays of all time by grabbing an insane 97.11% EZDT FC on [Frederic - oddloop](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1137879?m=0) on the oldloop difficulty. This is some top notch levels of reading and reflexes. Give this man his views!

[-GN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/895581) might have churned out the craziest osu! EZHD play of all time, pulling off an absolutely terrifying 96.56% EZHD FC on [Nico Nico Douga - BARUSA of MIKOSU](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/24722) (which is 9.53*!), taking the No. 1 spot on the map live at Dreamhack. This would be worth approximately 707pp. What else can be better than for you to watch this amazing play yourself, together with the live chat, straight from -GN's YouTube channel!

[Dusk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533210) is serious about cementing his number one place in the global rankings as he continues his osu!catch score runs with an absurd HR SS on [LeaF - Evanescent](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1009780) to gain a whopping 743pp and the second spot on the map, second only to [[224]Hyperw7](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4158549), who was 1 100 short of SSing it himself. Sit back, relax and have a look at Rowlet catcher sprinting across the screen with joy.

We haven't shown [jakads](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/259972) in the Scorewatch for a while now, so here he is, taking [sakuzyo - Altale](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/767311&m=3) and slapping on DT to pull off a crazy 99.87% FC on the hardest difficulty worth 677pp. Just enjoy some intense keyboard action along with jakads' interesting reactions.

## NOTABLE MENTIONS

[Karthy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4196808) followed [cptnXn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/495272)'s FOUR DIMENSIONS FC legacy and set his own score on [xi - Blue Zenith](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/292301) with a 99.86% FC to earn himself 553pp. That is 4 100s if you are wondering how insane this score could be, 2 at the final 10 seconds of the map. Congratulations to Karthy for setting this unbelievable score.

[WubWoofWolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/39828) still continues to amaze the crowd by beating his personal best on [Kurokotei - Galaxy Collapse](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/924759?m=0) and setting a 1406x combo 88.16% score to claim the No. 1 spot again live at Dreamhack.

## SCORESHOW WITH ZSEIKIMATSU

[_yu68](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6170507) and [uone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5321719) take speed, reading and memorization to the next level, going head to head on [u's - LOVELESS WORLD](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/959168) on HDDT!
