The Featured Artist roster continues to grow as we seek out talent from across the globe, both familiar and fresh. We're excited to present something a little different this time - namely [**LukHash**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/12) and his signature chiptune-infused dystopian take on a variety of electronic and EDM sounds!

Curious? Have a listen:

We were blown away when we first heard his work, and knew instantly that many of you would feel the same way. There's **over 60 tracks** to check out, all pre-timed and 100% ready to map. **LukHash** is sure to have something for nearly everyone - the sheer diversity across his tracks is really something very remarkable.

All the tracks on any Featured Artist listing are free to use for mapping in osu!, so worry less and map more. And map it quickly too, we're dying to see what people come up with!
