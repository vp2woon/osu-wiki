A close encounter with Airman, multiple 700pp plays and more in this week's edition of scorewatch!

![](https://puu.sh/wlWK2/b4023e5865.png)

[filsdelama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2831793) took aim, reading and accuracy to greater heights as he slammed his No. 1 Top Score and cemented his position at the top on [mimimemeMIMI - Harebare Fanfare](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1059894) with a 1x 100 99.81% HDHRDT FC to guarantee him a whopping 765pp. You might want to see that insane leaderboard jump at 0:58.

We showcased this play on our blog, but it is something not to be showcased on the front page of osu! Either! Enter [Angelsim](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1777162) who, and with the power of the tablet, stole the No. 2 spot on [ClariS - Hitorigoto -TV MIX-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/596704) with a stunning 99.22% HDHRDT FC to earn 712pp. Not bad for a player who has now 700pp plays with a mouse and, this time, with a tablet.

Could [Wilchq](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2021758) be the next person to HDHR FC [Team Nekokan - Can't Defeat Airman](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/104229?m=0)? Maybe, as he grabbed a 99.28% 2x miss HDHR play to earn 447pp. Watch out [My Angel Serena](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1545031), another European may steal that No. 1 spot very soon.

[Dusk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533210) took his time, but he finally sniped [[224]Hyperw7](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4158549) with an insane 2x miss 99.21% NC play on [wa. vs celas - Vajuranda](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/942057?m=2) to earn himself 847pp. This is some next level catching of fruits. Circles, I mean.

[inteliser](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1824775) decided to show off his impressive accuracy skills on [Helblinde - Memoria (Original Mix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1181795), nearly becoming the next player to SS this difficulty with a 99.98% FC, earning 482pp. What a shame that a 50 decided to come out from nowhere.

## NOTABLE MENTIONS

[My Angel Serena](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1545031), popularly known as NerO, isn't out of the scene yet. He recently set a crazy 99.23% HD FC on [Primary - Inai Sekai](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1185036?m=0) to steal 571pp and the No. 2 spot on the map, 2nd only to [DanyL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3069354) who had the same accuracy

[Emilia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2003326) may not have the accuracy, but he sure did have the amazing combo as he set a 96.27% 5x miss HD score on [Imperial Circus Dead Decadence - Uta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/890190?m=0), gaining 504pp and the No. 2 spot on the map.

[Wookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4407567) might have took lessons from the HDDT gods above as he stole an amazing HDDT 98.98% 2 miss score on [HoneyWorks - Miraizu feat.Aida Miou(CV:Toyosaki Aki)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/696225) and grabbed 615pp in the process.
