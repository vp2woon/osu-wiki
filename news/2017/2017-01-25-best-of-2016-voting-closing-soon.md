[Head on over to the contest listing and get voting now!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests)

Everyone has **10 votes per gamemode** to cast for their favourite ranked maps of 2016 - though only for maps that you've played at least once before.

The highest voted map for each gamemode will be declared the **Community Favourite of 2016** and the mapper will receive **6 months of osu!supporter** for their efforts. The top ten maps from each gamemode will also have their mappers receive **1 month of osu!supporter** as well.

Voting will **close very soon, on the 6th of February.**. This is your absolute last chance to have your voice heard and determine the favourite of 2016.

We'll have some interesting stats waiting for you when the voting is over - look forward to it!
