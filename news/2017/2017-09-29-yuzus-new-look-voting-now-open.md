[Head on over to the contest page to vote and decide.](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/49)

The vote will run for **14 days from the date of this post, ending on the 13th of October.**

The voting poll **DOES NOT** decide which of the looks Yuzu will take on as his official appearance, that choice falls to the osu!team.

The top 3 entries as decided by the community will be gifted **6, 4 and 2 months of osu!supporter** respectively.

As always, we're astonished with the level of care and skill that goes into the entries we see from our art-related contests.

[Make sure to vote, and let us know which three you like the best!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/49)
