What do chiptunes and food have in common? They're both **OISHII**! No, really, they're the favourite things of osu!'s latest Featured Artist, blasting soon to a beatmap near you!

A relatively new face on the chiptune scene, **OISHII** has been making waves after appearing out of literally nowhere.

All that we know is that every track of theirs is a sugar rush of 8-bit inspired hits, with video game and anime references sprinkled in to boot. Familiar with the *Kirby* games? You'll probably find **OISHII** familiar, too!

Have a listen to *ONIGIRI FREEWAY* and see for yourself:

Not satisfied? Take a trip down the *COCOA WATERSLIDE*:

One thing is certain - all of **OISHII**'s tracks are explosively sweet and short, and we now have **7** of them immediately available for you to use in beatmapping.
