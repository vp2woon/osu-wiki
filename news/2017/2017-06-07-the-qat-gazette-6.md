**Hello!** Even though I recently wrote about the osu!taiko, osu!catch and osu!mania Beatmap Nominator test results and feedback (with some assistance from OnosakiHito and Feerum), it's been a busy few weeks for us here at the Quality Assurance Team, so I wanted to bring you all up to speed with a more general-purpose article as well.

In a truly perfect world, I would also be calling on one of my colleagues to present their much anticipated discussion articles, but with the pressures of exam season, sadly real life priorities have to take the front. This would not be a major issue had the stars not aligned against me, with Feerum's computer tragically suffering from an acute case of not turning on. Therefore I'll be filling in with another informative interlude for you guys.

**With the welcome new additions of Cryptic and Doyak to the team, as well as the recent retirement of some of our old stalwarts DakeDekaane, Desperate-kun and Fycho,** it's obvious that the working fields of the QAT have changed quite significantly since our original post back in August of last year! Therefore, in order to clarify who's doing what in the modern age, let's take a little update as to the current state of affairs:

- **Beatmap Nominator Tests**
  - **Beginner osu!standard:** Cryptic, Irreversible, Mao
  - **Advanced osu!standard:** Mao, Okorin, pishifat
  - **osu!taiko:** Nardoxyribonucleic, OnosakiHito
  - **osu!catch:** Deif, JBHyperion
  - **osu!mania:** Blocko, Feerum
- **Metadata & Reports:** alacat, Doyak, IamKwaN
- **Spotlights (Ranking Charts):** Kurokami, OnosakiHito
- **Ranking Criteria:** Okorin, pishifat
- **General Assistant:** Cryptic

Additionally, with the exception of alacat and Kurokami (who will focus solely on metadata checks and Spotlights, respectively), all of the above listed team members now lead their own subdivision of Beatmap Nominators, working closely with them to promote team-working and communication. After reviewing recent feedback from the Beatmap Nominators, each of these subdivisions will compete with one another, with the highest performing groups receiving a reward.

**We have welcomed a brand new wave of 14 Beatmap Nominators into the world!** As mentioned in the opening part of this post, the conclusion of Beatmap Nominator tests for osu!taiko, osu!catch and osu!mania produced many fruitful results, with some returning after absence, others confirming their proficiency with a second mode, and others still crossing into the land of bubbles and yellow badges for the very first time. If you're even passingly involved in the mapping and modding scene, no doubt you'll be seeing these new and old faces around, so please give them all a big congratulations and a warm welcome! Whilst a review of the recent series of tests can be found in [my previous article](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-05-11-bn-test-review-2), new opportunities never cease - osu!standard Beatmap Nominator tests are currently underway also, so expect our family to grow even further very soon!

**The Ranking Criteria subsection has seen many new recent additions up for discussion.** As well as additions and amendments to the osu!standard general and specific subsections, there are now Skinning and Spread-related proposals up for discussion. The latter in particular will aim to resolve a number of current deficiencies in the General and Mode-specific Ranking Criteria sections which have become apparent in recent months, such as acceptable difficulty naming, how drain time is calculated, and the way in which hybrid-mode and collaborative mapsets are handled. If you want to help shape the future of our fair game, be sure to check those discussions out [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/87)!

## Ask us anything!

**Will BNG / community members be given the chance to apply for the QAT in the same way as the GMT from a few months ago?**

Presently, the GMT is a sizeable group encompassing a number of different roles, from technical support staff to language moderators and osu!media creation, so it is almost always “open” to new members who fit the criteria. The QAT on the other hand is a relatively small team with a specialised work field, so we will only look at recruiting people once there is a need to do so, such as replacing a departing member or leading a new working field.

**What does it take to join the QAT?**

Despite the previous answer, this doesn't mean we're not constantly looking for potential future members. Where the need arises, members will be promoted from the BNG (typically from the Advanced Tier in osu!standard) after demonstrating consistently high standards of activity and proficiency in their field. Maturity, integrity and the ability to lead and motivate are also essential qualities for anyone in a supervisory position, but a willingness to take proactive steps towards improving the community in some way should also not be overlooked.

**What is the point of mapping if anything you post isn't going to be noticed by anyone?**

If you never try, you are guaranteed to never be noticed! Everyone has to start at the bottom, but with hard work and dedication, they can climb to the top all the same, from taking your first steps in mapping and modding, to becoming an Elite Mapper or joining the QAT. This is a great aspect of a community-driven game such as osu! - each and every member has the potential to bring something new and exciting for all others to enjoy. If you want something to happen, make it happen. Don't wait for the change - be the change.

**Hopefully these answers give you a little insight into how the Quality Assurance Team recruits members and what it takes to earn our recognition.** If I didn't answer your question this time around, don't worry! I may revisit unanswered topics in a later issue. That being said, keep the comments rolling in and your ideas might just help shape the future direction of not just the QAT, but osu! as a whole!

It's time to call curtains on this issue of the QAT Gazette, but we'll be back real soon with some more news and reviews. If any of my colleagues survive their ordeals with exams, technological malfunctions and the slew of Beatmapping Contests, World Cups and other community events currently ongoing, you can expect some more hearty discussion sessions from them also, so stay tuned!

Thanks for reading!
