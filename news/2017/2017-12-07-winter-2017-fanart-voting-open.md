As usual, our absurdly talented community artists have made the unbelievable happen and created a winter wonderland of entries for you to agonize over. With only **six** votes at your disposal, which of these incredible creations is your favourite?

A selection of the top-voted entries will make it to the main menu as winter seasonal backgrounds, remaining to usher in holiday cheer until the new year. The artists responsible for such magnificent work will also receive **2 months of osu!supporter** for themselves or a friend, or two friends!
