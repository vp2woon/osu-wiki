MBC#13 judging is finally concluded, and we have a winner!

Set to the tune of our very own [*BilliumMoto*](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3862471)'s remixed rendition of the *circles!* theme, MBC#13 was all about weaving a full set of difficulties around something new. Thirteen brave mappers stood up to the challenge and put forward their work for a set of judges to view, and here are the results:

Coming in **first place** with a grand total of **37.8/50** score was [**RyoKazuka**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6258586)'s entry (known to the judges as *Wary Skunk*). The judges all found his work to be of the highest calibre - scoring the highest in technical skill, creativity, impression and an absolutely dominating presence in overall difficulty curve.

You can play the winning entry [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/569888), in all its glory.

Following closely behind with **34.4** score was [**Fort**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2805457)'s entry, claiming the highest flow and structure score seen in the contest, even greater than that of first place.

[**Pho**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3624692)'s entry came close to snatching second place away with a tidy **33.4** score but ultimately ended up in third place, despite demonstrating flow and structure equivalent to that of first place.

[**RyoKazuka**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6258586) takes away the grand prize, including *6 months of osu!supporter*, the highly-coveted *Elite Mapper* title, and we're sure to be seeing more of his work featured in the osu!weekly very shortly.

Thank you to everyone who entered. We noted a comparatively small amount of entries compared to other contests this time around - we chalked this up to the entries going up during the middle of the holiday season (poor timing on our part).

The Monthly Beatmapping Contests have already resumed post-Aspire, as we also move MBC prizes towards a more centralized *Elite Mapper* ranking system, which we'll be revealing more on as time passes.

Many thanks to our esteemed judges, namely [Okorin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405), [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087), [Gabe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/654108), [Wafu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/888955) and [Natsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1953876). These outstanding individuals essentially modded a dozen complete mapsets in under two weeks without skipping a beat from their other duties and responsibilities - no small feat for any one of them!
