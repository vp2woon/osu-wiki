A familiar face joins the ranks of the osu!musicians - none other than [**Kuba Oms**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/13), the talent behind *My Love*!

Introduced years ago with the advent of one of our first MBC winning maps, [**Kuba Oms**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/13) is perhaps the first artist many people have encountered through osu!. His signature pop-like hit combined with his fearsome songwriting talents and a dash of soul all combine to produce a sound that is both familiar and fresh, and absolutely perfect for mapping of all levels.

The entirety of his latest album, *ADHD*, is now available for your use in mapping and modding. Like what you hear? Check out [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/13) for links to his Bandcamp and much more, and consider purchasing some of his music for your own listening!

As always, every track available via the Featured Artist listing is totally free to use for mapping in osu!, so worry less and map more.

Keep your eyes peeled throughout May, as we have a lot more to announce on the Featured Artist front, including some names that might just be as familiar as Kuba Oms is.
