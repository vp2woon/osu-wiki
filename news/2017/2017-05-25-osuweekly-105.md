**The live drawings for the [osu!catch World Cup](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/blob/master/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2017/en.md) will be happening this sunday at 1400 UTC!** Excited to see who your favorite teams will get grouped up with? Tune in over at the [osu!live twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) get in on the first round of formalities before the action!

**People have been doing some pretty amazing things with the in-progress lazer build already!** One such project is Vitaru, a game mode based on the [touhosu feature request](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/19307) from ancient history. It looks like with [peppy himself taking notice](https://twitter.com/ppy/status/865171251148374016) of this project, the cat is out of the bag now! We'll be providing a lot more support for custom game modes in the future, and vitaru is a prime example of how simple it is to get started with creating your own rhythm based adventure. Keep up the great work!

osu!lazer saw one of it's busiest weeks yet, with development contribution from the community skyrocketing over the course of the past week. You can check out these and more (recent) updates over at [peppy's development blog](https://blog.ppy.sh/).

- **A [new spinner design](https://blog.ppy.sh/2017-05-18/) has made it into the ranks of functioning features!** The new visual helps better quantify your progress throughout flailing your hand around in attempts to squeezing out those extra 1000 points.
- **The skip button has been [moved to a more accessible location](https://blog.ppy.sh/2017-05-19/)!** The days of snapping your pointer to the left hand side to skip an intro are over. In addition to being conveniently located near the middle of the playfield, there is also a nice progress indicator of how long you have until you have to start clicking for your life (unless you toggled no-fail)!
- **osu!direct, profile, user, and multiplayer panels have been [added into the game](https://blog.ppy.sh/2017-05-24/)!** It looks like a good portion of flyte's designs are finally making it into the new client.

**[HappyStick](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Happystick) had an opportunity to sit down with prolific players [Azer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Azer) and [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Toy) to try to help new players figure out how to get better at the game.** This seems to be the first in a series of videos/livestreams that Happystick will be putting out with this goal in mind. If you find yourself stuck on how to improve, you should definitely check it out!

[ThePooN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/718454) choked his way into 10,000pp by setting a crazy 99.17% 4x miss score on [DragonForce - Soldiers of the Wasteland](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/448281#osu/962194) to give him 551pp and the No. 1 spot on the map. This map has yet to be FC'd, but we're getting there.

After receiving a PM from HappyStick about wanting his own score to be sniped, [Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493) delivered within minutes, setting an outstanding 99.59% HDHR FC on [NU-KO - Pochiko no Shiawase na Nichijou (Long Version)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/307034#osu/1154766). That was an effortless 600pp from him...scary.

Continuing on the theme of sniping, [Vaxei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4787150) stole Rafis' No. 1 spot on [Camellia - Routing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/403282#osu/967546), setting an impressive 99.36% HD FC on the toughest difficulty to earn 530 pp. The score was set only a day after Rafis', so their rivalry is really intense!

[ankohime](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7556189) ascended to new heights after pulling off an incredible 99.12% HDDT FC on the marathon taiko map [simo - Chou Kumikyoku "Nico Nico Douga"](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/337196#taiko/746111), earning him 606pp. If you've got 7 minutes to spare, do check this out!

[Zyph](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1600432) took accuracy to a whole new level in osu!mania by SSing [(Various Artists) - Jumpstream Of Fighters](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/547215#mania/1159130) Glorious Crown 5.79* chart. To all mania players, this must be seen!

==SCOREWATCH SCORE SHOW==

This week, HR specialist sobatsuyu takes on equally talented mafuyu-shiina, battling it out with HRDT on Megpoid GUMI - Sorry For Being a Closet Otaku. OD 9.8 + DT is truly frightening.
