[Adamqs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/613592) took a 50 minute stroll down memory lane as he took on the [Within Temptation - The Unforgiving](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/156352) Marathon, slapping on HDHR to snipe WubWoofWolf with a crazy 97.79% HDHR FC to claim 358pp. If I were you, I would totally watch the whole thing.

[Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050) broke his limits and sprinted into the top 50 with an insane 99.30% HDDT 1 miss on [Yousei Teikoku - Torikago](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/894189) to earn himself 617pp. What a terrible choke, but do go give this guy some love!

[Angelsim](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1777162) grabbed an 8.14* 99.94% FC on [GET IN THE RING - Moonscraper](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/506618) live on stream, and this score would have been worth 619pp. Done with a tablet, this map consists of speedy jumps everywhere, and getting only 1 100 is very impressive. Check it out!

[Abstract-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3097304) sneaked in on [Hatsune Miku - Mythologia's End](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/beatmap?b=151229&m=2) and slapped on HDDT to claim the No. 1 spot with a 99.93% HDDT FC, grabbing 396pp. This play is as pleasing aesthetically as it is impressive.

[snoverpk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3595196) slammed Camellia - HELIXFOSSIL (not uploaded to the site) with an impressive 99.41% 4 miss play. This play is not to be underestimated as there are speedy rolls and jacks that the No. 1 Finnish osu!mania player tanks through. Check it out!
