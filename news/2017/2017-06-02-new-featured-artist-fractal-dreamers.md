Descend into the Kingdom of Silence with the latest talent to join the Featured Artist roster - the **Fractal Dreamers**!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/15/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/15)

Something familiar yet fresh, the **Fractal Dreamers** project is the culmination of two artists with completely different musical backgrounds achieving something new together.

The ever-talented [Helblinde](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5) and his wonderful wife, a classically-trained pianist, married their musical expertise together to create something really quite spectacular.

Decide for yourself:

We were smitten with this project from the moment we first heard it. Grand, orchestral choirs ring out amid frantic, pounding rhythms with a slick drum 'n bass twist, giving mappers almost everything they could ever dream of having in a track.

The entirety of the Kingdom of Silence EP is now available from the **Fractal Dreamers**' [Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/15).

As with all Featured Artist tracks, it's 100% licensed to use for mapping in osu! and its associated gamemodes - so worry less, and map more!

Make sure to check out [their Bandcamp](https://fractaldreamers.bandcamp.com/releases) for more details on their work, as well as the means to snag yourself a high-quality copy of their brand new EP.

We're super excited to see where else the **Fractal Dreamers** take us, and we hope you are too!
