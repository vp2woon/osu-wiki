- Do not create teams in advance! Teams will be formed after registration phase concluded by country's team captains.
- Hand in your registration before **29. October 2017.**

Note that you can only participate if you are of a **osu! global ranking of #5000 or higher and did not violate the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months**.

If your registration successfully passed our evaluation, you will be put on the candidate list for your country. Whenever a captain for your country has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

_Remember that any registrations past the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances - so get your registrations done early to avoid any last-minute issues._
