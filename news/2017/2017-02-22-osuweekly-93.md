## Weekly news

**After nearly 3 weeks and over 200,000 votes across all game modes, the [Best of 2016 maps have emerged.](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-02-16-best-of-2016-results)** Big congratulations to [Monstrata](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2706438), [OzzyOzrock](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/465153), [Ascendence](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) and [Fresh Chicken](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3984370) for taking first place in their respective game modes. If you'd like to check the full results, you can do so [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Xs9u7dzd5qHxkC_XE77NYjnM7xbnh9FTSMmpIJJkDE/edit#gid=0). We saw a lot of amazing maps in 2016 and hopefully we'll see even more in 2017!

**Speaking of, if you'd like to try out some of the Community Favourite maps from 2016, Stefan has uploaded a new [beatmap pack](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/packlist?t=t) with the top 5 maps from each game mode.** See for yourselves why they were crowned the favourite of the year.

**We've got another storyboard in the spotlight this week, courtesy of [Damnae](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/989377) and his unrelenting skill.**  His latest work, [Rampage](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/505170), sets the bar as high as ever with a uniquely humorous twist on two things close to every osu! player's heart: beatmaps and Vocaloids.

**Also a big happy birthday to [JackG256](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7284332), who celebrated his birthday recently and was lucky enough to get a cake with it's own osu! cookie on it!** While he did have to share the cake with his sister (and whatever that monstrously majestic unicorn abomination is), it's still a really cool cake and has us all a little bit jealous.

**With the osu!taiko World Cup live drawing edging closer and closer, Taiko's very own rendition of the ever infamous score v2 has been released.** If you haven't been keeping up with the changes to the [new scoring system](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/550582), now would be the best time to learn more about what's changed, and even test it out for yourself. Please do remember though that this is still a work in progress and that things might change at some point.

## Scorewatch: February Week 3 (With Scorewatch Patrol)

**[Rohulk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3219026) has finally taken a leap of faith into the 600pp club by setting an astonishing 99.65% HDHR FC on [9mm Parabellum Bullet - Inferno](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1029562) on the Tortured Soul Extra difficulty, grabbing not only 648pp but also the No. 1 spot on the difficulty, dethroning Musty.** That play also shot him up to 11th in the global rankings, the highest he has ever been. Quite simply, amazing.

**Remember [WubWoofWolf's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/39828) iconic [Lily - Scarlet Rose](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/41686) HDHR liveplay?** Well, he has finally managed to SS it, and got himself 328pp, but pp isn't important here. All we can say is, it has finally been done. WubWoofWolf is still going strong in 2017. Check it out, you don't wanna miss it. (Apologies for the slight cut at the intro.)

**Another HDHRDT FC has been pulled off in osu!standard!** Who else can it be but [filsdelama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2831793). His 98.56% FC on [Petit Rabbit's - Takarabako no Jet Coaster](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/946685?m=0) got him 639pp and the first spot on the difficulty. Quite astonishing how he managed to keep 99% throughout the whole map until the end. Check it out below:

**[sobatsuyu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2076374) is back here again with another HRDT play, setting a 99.65% FC on [SymaG - Buriki no Dance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1029561?m=1), gaining 570pp and also becoming the first player to HRDT FC this difficulty.** We'll say, the hit concentration in this play is nuts. Check it out:

**An unlikely player has gotten a DT FC on [Memme - Acid Burst](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/846620?m=2).** Say hello to [Tsukiyama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5375171), currently rank 69 in osu!catch, gaining 613pp. The accuracy is at an incredible 99.65%, which is matchable to Callionet's HDDT FC a few months back, and the entire map stays at 270BPM. Take a look at it:

**NOTABLE MENTIONS:**

[MouseEasy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1558603) went absolutely nuts by setting a 94.75% HDDT FC on [Blackhole - Lagomorphic](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/211889?m=0), earning 431pp and setting the very first DT FC score for the map. Yikes.

[Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) came out from pretty much nowhere and pulled off an outstanding HDDT 99.27% FC on [Ayaka Ohashi - Wagamama MIRROR HEART](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1177269?m=0), gaining 632pp.

[\_Rise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5217107) continues to rise in osu!taiko with a HDNC 99.35% FC on [dj TAKA - True Blue](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1078478), scoring 503pp.

**It's time for a brand new puzzle!** We've gone back to the simple yet classic *word search*. The theme this time around is staff members. This isn't just limited to GMT's or QAT's though. There might be a few devs lurking around in there, or maybe some Alumni. Tread carefully, some of the names can be tricky to spot.

**And if you'd like some more puzzle goodness, [Parachor](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5241655) is hosting a [team based puzzle tournament.](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/559954)** Players will form teams of 2-4 players and will be given 2 weeks to solve 8 puzzles. Sign-ups will last for a week or 2 depending on amount of interest, so if this sounds like something you'd like to participate in, grab some mates and sign up fast while you can.

With that all said and done, I'm off to get some cake. If you have any suggestions for what you would like to see in the weekly (and have some spare time), feel free to drop by the [osu!dev discord](https://discord.gg/ppy) and directly highlight [Nyquill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/682935) or myself ([deadbeat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/128370)) in the #osu-weekly channel. Alternatively, you can also e-mail as usual at [news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh).

See you next week!
