**Mentee applications for both [osu!standard](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/585200) and [osu!catch](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/585850) have started and we're primed to enter a new cycle!** For those of you who are desperately (like me) trying to up their game in the mapping community, what better opportunity is there than this? While mods are dime a dozen, it's not an exaggeration to say getting sincere opinions and critiques is a seldom received gift. If you are sincere in your pursuit of a better beatmap, head on over and apply today!

**The osu!lazer development branch saw the introduction of the new expandable in-game mod overlay!** It might be quicker to just show you what I mean, but if you haven't yet, you should definitely follow the osu!dev blog for further updates on the new version of our game!

**The osu!SOFT (Springtime osu!mania (4K) FFA Tournament) has reached a decisive conclusion!** The grand finals proved to be a battle between two absolute giants in terms of ability. With the format being a survival of the fittest deathmatch, how can you be surprised? [Cobo-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Cobo-), coming from the winners bracket, faced off against [cheetose](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/cheetose) from the lower bracket. After a bracket reset and some incredible performances from both players, cheetose would go and take the top spot in the tournament. Congratulations!

For the first time in a while, it might be worthwhile to give ourselves a refresher with so many front page news this week!

**Starting from the top, [osu!catch World Cup registration](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-05-03-osucatch-world-cup-2017-registrations-now-open) has begun!** See? I told you you guys didn't have to wait long! If you're interested in representing your country and are at least rank \#5000 in the mode, head on over to see if you qualify and compete for fruit catching glory! That said, we'll be starting our regular coverage of the tournament as well, so look no further for regular updates on the status of our premier tournaments.

**[Kuba Oms](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/13) has joined the ranks of our featured artists!** It's been a long time coming, but the prolific Canadian artist will finally have his music available for mappers to use for creative output. Ever since My Love became the hot topic with [MBC #4](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2014-02-14-monthly-beatmapping-contest-4-submissions-now), the winning entry has been a staple within the osu! client. His music has been the gatekeeper for our game for a very long time, and now we'll finally be able to see more of them throughout our adventure!

**[osu! will be making an appearance at Anime Expo 2017!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-05-09-osu-at-anime-expo-2017)** Join us between July 1st and July 4th at the Los Angeles Convention Center and hang out with the crew that makes osu! happen behind the scenes. We'll be hosting a variety of events on-site, including but not limited to tournaments and (hopefully) panels!

**For the first time ever, osu!taiko will have its [very own edition of the aspire contest!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-05-10-aspire-stage-two-osutaiko-begins)** The excitement is building up as we wait to find out what kind of crazy new ways to break the game mode will emerge. For those who wish to participate, you have a full month (+1 day for timezone reasons) to get your submissions in.

**The [osu!speedrunning community](https://www.speedrun.com/Osu/full_game#10_FC) has taken off with some [fierce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1YvV_XLR6U) [first week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bH2gxkEZ5I) [competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XURHiPwoFv4)!**Our very own MillhioreF currently holds the record for the fastest to 10 full combos. When asked about what he had to say to people going after his record, he had [this](http://nyquill.s-ul.eu/EVVVtbAR) to say. While this may seem bizarre for a lot of us, it's always cool to see people find their own enjoyment in the spirit of how rhythm games should be.

**The channel "Click The Circles" uploads a lot of "progression" videos showcasing the change of player ability over time.** This week, we can get a glimpse of how well top players did on two classic challenge maps: [Chipscape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NItVcsbYuE) and [Atama no Taisou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0a7Q3VmjbY). With these videos being only the beginning as a wealth of comparison based and ranking content, it wouldn't be a bad idea to check out more of their videos!

[Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493) continues to shoot for the 14,000pp barrier as he made his mark on [Chitose Sara - Merry Merry Go Round](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1003944?m=0) with a crazy 99.22% HDDT FC to claim 706pp. With this score, he now has ten 700pp+ top plays. Check it out!

People wondered if [filsdelama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2831793) would follow up Vaxei's HDHRDT FC on [ClariS - Hitorigoto -TV MIX-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1262832?m=0) and snipe the bacon down. Well, you no longer have to wonder, as he did it within a week, achieving a staggering 99.41% HDHRDT FC and grabbed his No. 1 Top Rank as well, sitting at 726pp.

How on EARTH are you supposed to read this? [_Rise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5217107) pulled off the first ever HDHR FC on [Camellia - Exit This Earth's Atomosphere](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/567916#taiko/1203661), scoring 527pp with his 99.10% score. Incredible.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mu7iI3A8pl4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

"We await the first FC on the SV difficulty of [Camellia - Shun no Shifudo o Ikashita Kare Fumi Paeria](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/453985#mania/977744)", that was what I wrote back in osu!weekly \#84, but it seems like the dream has came true, all thanks to [jakads](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/259972) who pulled off an outstanding 99.96% SD FC on the SV difficulty. This is one mania score you have got to watch!

[inteliser](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1824775) stole another SS from a 5* map as he obliterated [ZOGRAPHOS (Yu_Asahina+Yamajet) - Verse IV](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/264749) with a 162:1752 SS, beating out the likes of jhlee0133, jakads and Cobo-. This is a watch for the mania players!

=NOTABLE MENTIONS=

[ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) took 74 hours to complete [MillhioreF - Waltz o' the Irish](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/326585&m=0). Yes. 74 hours. He streamed this amazing slow slider score on twitch to complete an amazing 1 note SS score.

[DanyL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3069354) and [Vaxei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4787150) blew Cookiezi's score into a pile of dust as they took [TrySail - High Free Spirits -TV.Ver-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/440706#osu/980431) (Skystar's Extra) and smashed it with 96.79% and 98.82% HDDT FCs, giving them 692pp and 746pp respectively.

[Musty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/251683) followed in Vaxei's footsteps and, within 2 weeks, secured a breathtaking 98.86% HR FC on [DragonForce - Symphony of the Night](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/985141?m=0) to earn himself 620pp.

[free mutual](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4650315) lost his sanity and went for an amazing 99.77% FC on [BABYMETAL - Road of Resistance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/869222?m=0) to earn himself 633pp and sniping Rafis off the throne after more than a year. It seems that he is not quite done with this map [yet](https://twitter.com/idkieee/status/859547039587221504), so keep your eyes peeled for the coming months!

==SCOREWATCH SCORE SHOW==
