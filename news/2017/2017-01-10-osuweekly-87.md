The year is 2017. It's a brand new year with endless possibilities. Only catch is that it still features the same old osu!weekly you've all come to love. You do love us, right?

## Weekly news

**The first batch of 2017 Loved maps are ready for voting!** Would you like to see [Knife Party](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/123040) receive some love, or are you a supporter for [Camellia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/490335)? Perhaps you're more in tune with the sweet sounding screams of [Igorrr](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/442876) or maybe relaxing to the *unique* sound of [The Flashbulb](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/201515). Whichever is your preference, make sure to head over to the [voting threads](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/65) to cast your vote! The poll only runs for about 2 days (48 hours) from now, so get in quick!.

**After years in the making, it is now finally possible to submit multiple scores on maps in the Loved category**. A long awaited feature, this now means that maps may have a number of scores from the same user on the scoreboards instead of just the single score as it was previously. Only the highest score will count for pp and accuracy when the system moves on to other Ranked maps later in the year.

**[Syrin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5701575) has released a rather nifty tool for getting some information about how you play the game.** The program, named [osu!chan](https://syrin.me/osuchan/) provides information about both your profile and your top performance scores, including those chokes you'd rather forget. You also have the option to filter by mods or no mod, depending on your preferences.

**The osu!academy channel has released some more fantastic storyboard showcases for you to enjoy!** First, there's [Euclid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axzMhF0Ciic) created by [Exile-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2559349) and secondly, there's [Sweet Dreams (11t dnb mix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJwv_4CsSLA) created by [Storyboarder](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6124671) (yes that is their name).

**[S3RL](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/9) and [nanobii](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/10) have just been announced as the newest additions to the Featured Artists roster.** S3RL has already made a huge impact in osu! with several of his tracks already made into insanely popular maps. On the other hand, nanobii is someone we haven't seen much of yet in osu!, but his popularity elsewhere on the web (did someone say Monstercat?) and his amazingly uplifting tracks have some serious potential for some incredible mapping.

## Scorewatch: January Week 1 (with the Scorewatch Patrol)

Before we get into the scorewatch this week, there is something we'd like to cover. Previously, it was just poor Raveille hunting down and sharing some of the insane plays people were doing on a weekly basis. However, Scorewatch has expanded and we now have a small team of people working on this.

This new team consists of:

- [magnomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718)
- [n1doking](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5991961)
- [Poised](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3414210)
- [Raveille](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1388767)
- [Xylo-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3812814).

Hooray for progress! Now, onto some scores:

**It's actually pretty hard to play bad on purpose.** [MinG3012](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1583218), however, is the master of bad accuracy, and has pulled off an impossible score, with a 45.59% HD FC (not to mention, a Perfect graph) on [9mm Parabellum Bullet - Inferno](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/482090), on The Eclipse difficulty. Only a few have managed to FC this difficulty with the HD mod slapped on, which makes this play even more impressive. Engulf yourself into the madness that is MinG3012. So bad that it is actually good. Or it was just good from the start.

**[Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493) is on fire yet again as he pulled off an insane HDHR play on [UNDEAD CORPORATION - Everything will freeze](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/555797?m=0), on the Time Freeze difficulty.** This run saw only 2 misses, which unfortunately did not beat his personal best, but would stand at 652pp. Without the choke, this play would stand at an incredible 869pp. See it to believe it. Will 2017 be the year of the fabled 1k pp score? Time will tell.

**hvick225 has now dropped to 5th as a certain 13 year old American has climbed a step higher with a new personal best!** [Vaxei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4787150) managed to set a 730pp score on [HO-KAGO TEA TIME - Kira Kira Days](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/954692?m=0) on the Shiawase!! difficulty, choking a HDDT 98.03% play. There's some intense 300BPM single-tapping in this video, so go check it out!

**Our very own [n1doking](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5991961) became the first taiko player to FC [Renard - Because Maybe! pt.2](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/beatmap?b=369349&m=1).** Why? Because he could. This 22 minute marathon map tests one's stamina greatly, and the No. 1 American has shone brightly in the leaderboards. Try not to fall asleep while watching this replay. n1doking surely didn't.

**Former osu!mania no. 1 [jhlee0133](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/140148) pulled off an unfortunate 1 miss play on [Fleshgod Apocalpyse - The Deceit / The Violation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1002277?m=3) on Xeo's Unmerciful Fate difficulty.** This 10 minute song brings out the living hell of mania players and this pushes the limits between speed and stamina. Take a dive into the depths of metal with this incredible play, but be aware of the unforgettable (at least for jhlee0133) miss.

The osu!mania World Cup 7K is now fully underway with the live drawings complete. Our teams have been sorted into their groups, the mappool has been revealed (anime girls world cup 2017) and the schedule for the group stage is already out! If you're interested in learning more, all the information is available on the [wiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/MWC7K_2017). If you'd rather skip that and cut straight to the action, we'll be starting things off next weekend on Saturday the 14th at 11am UTC.

Before we leave you for the week, our new year comes with a new addition to the weekly team. [Xylo-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3812814) will be helping Starrodkirby86 in creating even more puzzles! Speaking of,we have a new one for you hungry puzzle solvers to chip away at. This time, it's a plain and simple crossword focusing on maps that were classed as some of the best maps of their respective years.

That's all from us this week. We hope you all had a great holiday and start to 2017. A lot of amazing stuff happened last year, and who knows what to expect this year!
