Light it up with this week's Scorewatch, featuring some crazy plays on Blue Zenith, United DT, squartatrice and more!

[Mlaw22](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3126596)'s 99.56% FC on [xi - Blue Zenith](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/658127?m=0) is a mixture of 90% skill and 10% absolute luck. Watch as he tanks through the monster streams as if they're nothing, complete with a reaction that makes you think he does this sort of thing on a daily basis!

[Wilchq](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2021758) finally lit his top ranks up on fire with his first ever 600pp play on [Camellia - Light it up](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1093078?m=0) with a crazy 99.76% HDHR FC to claim 601pp. All his hard work paid off in the end!

[shinchikuhome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3174184) set a breathtaking 1x 100 DT score on the recently spotlighted [Our Stolen Theory - United (L.A.O.S Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1183029?m=1), earning 498pp. At OD7, this DT score is truly a testament to his amazing accuracy - a must see for all taiko players!

[SimSimHam](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9685275) (formerly known as FaL3C_ChoBo) managed to pull off something that many would deem impossible. His #1 6x 200 score on [Jack Trammell - SV Pack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1256061&m=3) Marathon diff (all three songs in one) is an incredible show of SV reading skill. I definitely recommend watching the video below, your head will be blown!

[Pope Gadget](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2288341) has also shown off his SV (but not only!) skills on [Camellia - Glitch Nerds](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1004136&m=3). The map has a little bit of everything - long notes, jacks, speed sections, bursts - and he does them nearly perfectly! Check the play out yourself in the video below!

## NOTABLE MENTIONS

[Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) joins the ranks of the unholy trinity of players (consisting of filsdelama, Angelsim and Vaxei) by setting the next HDHRDT FC on [ClariS - Hitorigoto -TV MIX-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1262832?m=0) with 97.84%, earning 655pp! While he didn't quite make the No. 1 spot on the leaderboards, he certainly enjoyed finally getting the score he wanted!

[Dustice](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/754565) took a huge blow to his score on [Remo Prototype[CV: Hanamori Yumiri] - Sendan Life](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/901854?m=0) with a 2x 100 1x miss HDHR play (99.74%) to earn himself 613pp. This score could've matched even Cookiezi's score!

[OskaRRRitoS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7051163) took [MillhioreF - Waltz o' the Irish](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/326585&m=0) and played it for 3 days straight! Not willing to be outdone by ExGon who did the same map a couple weeks ago, he does it with HTNF and grabs an SS! For once this is a score we won't recommend you to watch in its entirety, but definitely something worth mentioning.

## SCOREWATCH SCORE SHOW

[Estonians](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7014697) takes on [Zei-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1530308) on the 6.16* Loved osu!mania map [gmtn. vs. kozato (fw. LUZE) - squartatrice](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/846925)!
