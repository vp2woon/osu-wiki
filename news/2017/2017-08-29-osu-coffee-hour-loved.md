## This week's theme

We'll be covering the somewhat controversial topic of the *Loved* beatmap category introduced several months ago.

Widely acclaimed and then widely reviled shortly after, the category has been the source of much discussion and disgruntlement since it's implementation in October, 2016.

## This week's guests

Joining myself ([HappyStick](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/256802)) for the discussion will be one of the community's most prolific members of the QAT, [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418), and one of the people responsible for pushing the category in the first place, [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335) from the osu!team.

Together, we'll be going through why Loved is the way it is, what brought about its development in the first place, and where it will be heading in the future.
