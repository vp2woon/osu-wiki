[-GN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/895581) is now a champion above champions (quite literally, he got a title on his userpage)! What did he do? He became the first player to no mod FC [Blind Stare - Shotgun Symphony+](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/32570) since it got ranked (which was 8 years ago!) with a brilliant 98.26% score to take a mere 213pp, but don't let the pp fool you. What a score, and what a player! Take a bow -GN, give him the love he deserves!

## BLAST FROM THE PAST

[Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689) gets featured for this section as he tears through [Kitsune^2 - Tung, The Icelandic Lesbian](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/114295) with a crazy 96.68% HDDT FC, earning 258pp. This man has quite the control, missing only one slider end through this 240BPM 2011 map!

Once again, do support [osu!archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/6ysxim/osuarchive_22_toy_kitsune2_tung_the_icelandic/) (it is still ongoing on the osugame reddit), more scores are being churned out as this gets published!

## NOTABLE MENTIONS

[Karthy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4196808) has taken the 2nd spot on [DragonForce - Above the Winter Moonlight](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/908042) with his amazing 99.28% HDHR FC, taking 574pp and beating out the likes of Beafowl, Mathi and FunOrange! With that, he has also leaped into the global top 50!

Amidst the controversy of touchscreen plays, someone has stepped up and taken a 700pp score with the playstyle! Enter [freedomdiver](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8482062), setting a 90.10% HDNC FC on [Izumi Akazawa (CV. Madoka Yonezawa) - Responsibility Response](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1055147?m=0) to take 708pp. Insert civilized discussions of this playstyle here.

## SCORESHOW WITH ZSEIKIMATSU

[ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) takes on fellow Korean [[224]Hyperw7](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4158549) on the Loved map [antiPLUR - Speed of Link](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/374606)!
