We're taking a break from new Featured Artists to highlight some older talents! More than **50** new songs have been added and **new osu!(lazer) Featured Artists playlists** have been published, so check everything out!

## osu!(lazer) Featured Artist playlists

Before jumping into the song additions, we wanted to announce a new batch of [**Featured Artist playlists**](/wiki/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists) on [osu!(lazer)](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/latest). In short, these are monthly playlists highlighting various Featured Artist songs with constantly changing gameplay gimmicks and nifty prizes.

The details for this month:

- Playlists are available for **all game modes**
- **5 songs** are included per playlist
- You have **15 TOTAL ATTEMPTS** for ALL MAPS in the playlist. This means you can play each map 3 times. Or you can play one map 15 times (which is a bad idea). Choose your plays wisely!
- The top **0.5% of players** will receive their mode's relevant profile badge:

![Featured Artist profile badge](https://assets.ppy.sh/profile-badges/fa-playlists/fapl-osu!.png) ![Featured Artist profile badge](https://assets.ppy.sh/profile-badges/fa-playlists/fapl-osu!taiko.png) ![Featured Artist profile badge](https://assets.ppy.sh/profile-badges/fa-playlists/fapl-osu!catch.png) ![Featured Artist profile badge](https://assets.ppy.sh/profile-badges/fa-playlists/fapl-osu!mania.png)

To participate, install osu!(lazer) from its [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/latest), enter the **playlists** section and filter the lobbies to **Featured Artists** in the top-right corner!

Anyway, read [this wiki article](/wiki/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists) if want more details. Let's dive into the new songs!

## New Featured Artist tracks

Here's how this works: **click on an artist's name or banner to visit their Featured Artist page.** All new songs are marked with a slick *NEW* icon!

We've listed out **every new song** below, along with a couple convenient previews per artist. If you're in more of a circle-clicky mood, we've also linked to any relevant ranked/loved maps!

Something is off. Do you feel it? You haven't received your twice-a-week dosage of Featured Artists yet.

To make up for it, we'll be releasing **two** Featured Artists this coming Wednesday! They won't include too many tracks each, but hopefully the double-dip will help you recover from such a devastating loss.

That's all for now, so start mapping and/or playing through the new [Featured Artist playlists](/wiki/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists)!

See you next week.
