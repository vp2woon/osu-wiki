Sink into the abyss where you'll find **Tenchio**, our newest Featured Artist.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/265/header.jpg)

As much as we want to describe **Tenchio**'s sound as simply "math rock", it's so much more than that. Filled with harsh tones, distinct emotion, and an effort to achieve something new with each tune, these songs can't reasonably be contained by any pre-existing genre.

We have **14** complicated tunes prepared for only the most innovative mappers, all available from [**Tenchio**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/265).

It should come as no surprise that these dense and complex songs have been most thoroughly explored by osu!taiko and osu!mania mappers. See how the two modes differ in interpretation through the video of *Tenchio - skeleton (Lettuce ver.)* below, then preview some other masterpieces:

I usually wouldn't (and probably shouldn't) reference myself in these news articles, but after listening to **Tenchio**'s songs for the last few minutes, I feel an uncontrollable urge to start mapping one of their songs. If you feel the same, [**Tenchio**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/265) is waiting.

Anyway, that's all for today's release! This weekend we'll be cancelling out the terror that is **Tenchio**'s sound with a cutesy J-pop artist, so stick around the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for a healthy dose of emotional whiplash.
