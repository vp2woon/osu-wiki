**Aiyru** pops into our Featured Artist library!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/296/header.jpg)

A fresh face in the rhythm game music scene and an even fresher face to osu!, we reckon electronic producer **Aiyru** is exactly what you've been waiting for. Taking inspiration from artists like *PSYQUI* and *Current Value*, **Aiyru**'s tracks slot flawlessly into our circle-clicking community.

**8** tunes are now permanently available for mapping from [**Aiyru**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/296)!

[juankristal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/443656) is here to prove that COE will never end with a liveplay of [Station](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1794071) using osu!(lazer)'s "Wind Up" mod. Once you're convinced to start mapping, check out the rest of the songs too:

Looking for something? Could it be the remaining songs from [**Aiyru**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/296) packed into pre-timed beatmap templates? You don't need to answer.

We have one more artist scheduled for the end of the month, and it's big. Like BIG big. Like over-100-songs big.
