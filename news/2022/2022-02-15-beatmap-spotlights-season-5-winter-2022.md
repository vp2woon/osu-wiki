Spotlights rivals, assemble! After a long break, we are finally back with many new changes like a brand new special play theme, so we hope you all are ready for **Winter Season 2022**!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/beatmap-spotlights.jpg)

With the new season launch, we'll be changing up some aspects of how the Beatmap Spotlights play to help keep things fresh. We're also going to be communicating things a little differently, so make sure to read on to figure out what's what.

If you just can't wait to try out the new maps, **the Beatmap Spotlights lobbies are now open for play on the osu!(lazer) client**. If you've got no idea how to get started with things, read on below!

## Changes

### New Spotlights playlists format

We've heard a lot of voices saying that the old playlists format might've been a little too boring for more experienced players, because one or two Extras or Insanes per list is just simply not enough to be interesting. To increase the competition, while keeping it approachable for newer players, we've decided to reshuffle how the playlists system work.

**From now on, each playlist will last 2 weeks and will include 2 Hard, 3 Insane, and 4 Extra difficulties.** Each season will consist of 3 playlists where after the first run, the playlists will be re-played for the second week.

### Themed playlists

**Starting this season, the first playlist of every season will be themed with some kind of gimmick.**

We've came to a conclusion that Spotlights playlists may have felt a little disconnected, so we're spicing things up a bit by making the first playlist of every incoming season *special*.

The theme for this run of the Beatmap Spotlights is **unorthodox rhythm**. If you like weird and wonderful rhythms, this new theme should be right up your alley.

### More transparency

We've heard a lot of concern over the fact that nobody really knows who's doing what and what is even going on in the Spotlighs Team.

We'd like to face this issue, and make it so everything is a little bit more clear to the outsiders. Each season announcement will now include an [Inside the Spotlights Team](#inside-the-spotlights-team) section, detailing the most recent team changes.

We will also credit respective curators, responsible for suggesting the maps, in the [picks lists](#winter-season-2022-first-playlists). There's more to come in that regard, so stay tuned for future seasons!

### Medals and beatmap packs

One big point of feedback we've received about the Beatmap Spotlights is that people would really like to continue the old beatmap pack plus medal scheme that originally accompanied the older Spotlights.

We'll be making a return to this, with both beatmap packs and fancy new completion medals being released for each game mode after all of the playlists have been released (which is halfway through the season). We're also looking into releasing medal packs for previous Spotlights seasons too, to get things up to date. Have fun getting your grindset on to collect them all!

## Inside the Spotlights Team

In this section we will cover member changes and important happenings inside the Spotlights Team:

**Curator additions:**

- **osu!taiko**: Hivie, radar
- **osu!catch**: Rocma
- **osu!mania**: \[ Decku \], Kibitz

**Curator resignations:**

- **osu!**: Icekalt, xbopost
- **osu!taiko**: Charlotte
- **osu!catch**: Deif, JBHyperion, Spectator
- **osu!mania**: Raveille

In addition to that, pishifat will be stepping away as the project's manager to handle his many other tasks. Hivie will replace him as a helping hand in making things work as intended.

## The Future

The new Beatmap Spotlights is still a project in its early development stage and depends a lot on community feedback and engagement to improve. Many things can (and will) change for future seasons, and it all depends on *your* feedback!

What do you want for the next season? What needs to be fixed? What are your opinions on the current system? You can voice out all your opinions [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1517423) and we will keep note of every suggestion, so please let us know how you feel about things.

We do hope you'll enjoy the Spring Season 2021 Spotlights, and, of course, we do hope that you'll enjoy the Winter Season even more!

See you in the upcoming lobbies!
