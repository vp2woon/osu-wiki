Celebrate the holidays with some festive Loved gifts! üéÑüéÅ

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

To those who're still unfamiliar with what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As always, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the November votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

Before we move on with this month's picks, let's talk about some changes within the Project Loved team:

- We'd like to bid farewell to [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323), [Nokashi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5431196), and [Zeus-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5464437), as they've resigned from the team very recently. Thank you for making Loved awesome by making sure that all picks have been thoroughly checked and prepared for the Loved category in terms of integral metadata and moderation checks!
- On the other hand, say hello to [Maxus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4335785)! He will be joining the metadata team to make sure that picks are in pristine condition before receiving their well-earned leaderboards.
- A new drummer approaches! [Eriha](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16320311) joins the osu!taiko Loved captains in order to help bring some of the community's most adored beatmaps to justice by granting them all a chance in the Loved polls.

That should be all in terms of updates for this month. Don't forget if you're interested in participating in Project Loved discussions of a certain game mode, or have any questions, that you can reach out in one of the Project Loved Discord servers listed below:

If you don't know who [blixys](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13015896) is, now is the time to meet them and their beautifully chaotic maps.

Speaking in a language that mostly consists of heavily constructed rhythms, map structure, and sliders, blixys shows us what they are capable of ‚Äî capturing destruction and rebirth in their map *Black Lotus*. Using their mapping and object manipulation skills to the max, blixys successfully pulls off a jaw-dropping beatmap full of flowers and lotuses. I can hear the people saying *"Beatmaps are never that serious and/or poetic, rHO!"* comments already, but if you don't believe me, take a gander and you'll see what I'm talking about üòõ

Do you like fumos? If so, this *might* be the map for you!

This tricky aim/spaced triple map offers everything you can think of that involves your aim hand. Mapped by [alden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3545323), notoriously known for his traumatizing spaced triples that can catch you off guard if you aren't ready for them, this map is the prime example of this fate. While generally being a wacky full screen aim test, this also tests your flow and slider aim abilities. Be sure to watch out for the big fumo slider at the end!

Anyone who's been in the community for a while has played a map with a song made by Renard, whether you know it or not. In the past years we haven't had much love for this artist in the Ranked section, so why not in the Loved section?

*Gabberse Town*, mapped by [Silverboxer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2166762), is a gabber-style remix of the Traverse Town theme from the *Kingdom Hearts* series. Like any gabber track, it features hard-hitting 1/3 beats, which as you all may know by now, is the perfect recipe for fun-to-play jumps, and Silverboxer achieves it perfectly in this map. The map also contains difficulties from all ranges of skill, so no excuses to not try out this one! It's up to you to decide whether this will be Loved, so make it count!

*"Blah blah blah... We get it rHO, you love nominating challenging maps into the Loved votings."* And you're right! And I'm going to do it again!

This time, I'm pushing [Snow Note](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/643394)'s *Shock!!* mapset. Sitting with difficulties starting from 6.31 stars with a BPM edit ranging to 7.54 stars, the legend Snow Note themselves has made this *shocking* set of maps. Make sure to keep your snappy aim, alternate tapping and streaming skills in check, because *Shock!!* has it all in one. Just make sure to not electrocute your hands trying to keep up!

*description written by [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334)*

In [Xarr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7262065)'s map of *Honx*, he showcases a new height to tech mapping and slider design that was rarely seen before, becoming one of the staples of tech in recent years. *Honx* is filled with non-stop wacky sliders, crazy patterning and unorthodox rhythm choices that don't seem to let up for a second. If you are a fan of high-end and fast-paced tech maps, then this should be right up your alley.

This map is definitely a test for those already at the peak of technical ability, and if it does pass the Loved vote I'll be watching closely to see what players can achieve on this!

Mir's mapset of the popular vocaloid track *GimmexGimme* is one that makes use of accelerating sliders to truly map the song to its highest potential while still being approachable by the wider player base.

This map is an absolute treat for players of any skill level, falling in the mid-5\* range and with patterns so fun that it feels like the song was made around the map, so be sure to check this out and give it a few tries, and I'll guarantee that it will be a great experience!

*description written by [Skill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7802027)*

Ever thought about a Time Freeze II..? Yes? Well, it's here in December's voting.

[Ekoro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/284905)'s take on *Yotogibanashi no Kamikakushi* is very reminiscent of his own very popular map [UNDEAD CORPORATION - Everything will Freeze (Time Freeze)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/158023#osu/555797). Just like Time Freeze, this map features 240 BPM death/spaced streams, along with the iconic squares littered throughout the map. The main difference is that this song only sits at 1:48 in length. Plenty of room for some retrying, and world class score potential!

Be sure to also check out [chocomint](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493)'s [1x100 HD FC](https://youtu.be/mDUsN-rLXMc) on this map!

Do you think this map is a good fit to enter Loved? It's up to you. Vote now!

[nyctalopia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1284666#osu) is a fantastic set. Both difficulties offer a unique alt experience with difficult patterning and heavy aim control. Although they sit at 6.5\* and 7.3\*, they deceive greatly and challenge the common style alt maps generally take, especially pronounced in the delusionalism difficulty. If any of this piques your interest, I heavily recommend you try this map out and see what it offers for yourself.

*description written by [rHO](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1629553)*

When in need of expressive challenging maps, always count on the legend [rustbell](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/rustbell)'s beatmaps.

Sitting at 10.51 stars with 2 minutes of non-stop 175 BPM patterns, fragmentation is a map full of fragments of jump/snappy aim patterns that are not forgiving at all. It is surely one of the classic rustbell beatmaps with that specific iconic feeling of how aggressive the challenge on a beatmap can be. Sounds like you're worthy of the challenge? Try the map out, and make sure your hands don't break into fragments themselves!

This map is one hell of a ride for those who do not know what is heading their way. *Xronial Xero* is a very innovative 335 BPM map featuring stamina-heavy parts, 500 BPM bursts and a creative outlet of various things ranging from simple SV to manipulated bar lines and flashing yellow notes. This map will be quite an experience for the taiko experts among us. So what are you waiting for?

*t+pazolite & Nanahira - They're again & again* mainly consists on repeating gimmicks that are slowly introduced throughout the map, which you may recognize from their previous works, such as yellow notes and heavy memory-focused sections, creating one perfectly executed map to have fun playing.

Coming straight from the [TWC 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2022#quarterfinals) Quarterfinals NM5 (in other words the gimmick pick‚Ñ¢), is *Boom Kitty - Burning Sands* which features mostly slowjam sections with multiple snappings and tricky-to-read patterns, but also high-speed sections to make sure you don't get too comfortable and stay on your toes ‚Äî as expected from a tournament pick.

Make sure to put a good amount of practice and you'll for sure manage to get the hang of it, but the flow and carefully executed structure of the map will ease a lot of the grind as the map is super fun to play. Have fun!

This map requires a lot of stamina, and the stream pattern of about 1300 consecutive notes at a BPM of 270 will come at you. You will also be able to work on your reading skills as there is a fast SV section.

We sincerely hope that you will take up the challenge and become the great player you are meant to be!

There's nothing better to celebrate those December festivities with, so go ahead and add some dembow to your rhythm gaming experience. The Hispanic community has for sure been doing just that, making this map set a top pick in multiplayer lobbies and gain more than enough popularity to reach the ears of us Loved captains. It's time for some dembow drum mashing, so go ahead and try this map out!

As the title of the song would imply, *My HERO* is 260 BPM with very little room for rest, especially in Shallty's difficulty which contains several 50+ note streams in the kiais, enjoy!

Another hell map climbing its way up to the podium this month: *Shadow Castle* by [Stardust Prism](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8525921). This map is true stamina hell and known as an incredibly fun map due to its relentless wiggle and jump patterns. Previously featured in the [osu!catch Nightmare Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1526012), this map was one of the maps that gave sheer terror to the ones who played it due to its finger destroying capabilities.

Alongside Shadow Castle this month we have another speed map from [CLSW](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/531253)! Similar to his [*Blastix Riotz* compilation difficulty](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/524546#fruits/1113357), which was loved in 2016, this map is filled with a huge assortment of challenging patterns ranging from sharp transitions, a deadly tap dash section and unforgiving antiflow left-rights. Because of the approach of this map, most sections are challenging even for the most trained of players, and if you are able to slay this map with NM, it becomes an even bigger challenge with mods as well.

Used in [CWC 2019](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2019) as a NM pick in the RO16, this map should be familiar to most. Having both a low approach rate and a smaller circle size, this map is great for not only NM but also for testing the waters with all 3 major mods, HR, HD and DT.

Not only is there one map set created for a tournament in this month's rotation, but two! [II-L](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/172)'s *SPUTNIK-3* was created for the [osu! Master League 2 tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1495293), more specifically for the Hidden bracket. Now this was mapped for the Grand Finals, so you can sort of expect what the difficulty will be. The patterns are pretty straightforward for the most part, featuring a lot of wiggles of all types with varying spacing in between.

With the approach rate of 9 and circle size of 5 it'll be a fun challenge to tackle with Hidden, but I'm sure there are some people that are willing to take it head on with Hard Rock, or perhaps even Double Time.

*description written by [\[Crz\]hinako1804](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13747903)*

You've probably played many maps of *Fracture Ray*, but most likely, this one is the coolest one. Also, you may remember [Phukiir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4556538)'s stunning bar line show in Aspire V ‚Äî and now he is back two years later with another piece of his epic SV!

It's a distinctive map with a crazy amount of gimmicks, but what impressed me more is that it strikes a great balance between gimmick and sight-reading. Since it was chosen in the [MCNC 2020](/wiki/Tournaments/MCNC/2020#semifinals) Semifinals as a memory SV pick, you will also have to face its challenges.

Be vigilant not to be dismantled and shredded by high-energy rays, and at the end, don't forget to make the bar lines visible. :)

Nowadays, it's fairly hard charting something unique using certain patterns. Most of the time, that just adds one more map to the pile of an already oversaturated pattern. This is why maps like [TheFalek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10214260)'s *super anime groove 3d world* manage to stand out ‚Äî by offering a fun and unique experience while being true to the song they've charted!

Not only is this their first time being nominated in Loved, it was also featured in the [osu!mania 4K World Cup 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2021_4K#quarterfinals) Quarterfinals pool. The map was not only enjoyable, but also challenging with higher rates. And while it might be an entry-level chordjack chart on its base rate, I assure there will be a challenge for those playing the higher difficulties.

We hope for this month's chordjack pick to be of everyone's liking!

Wake up babe, new Loved DJ Sharpnel-core chart just dropped. Jokes aside, [Halogen-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/169992) is joining us once more with *Seon*! It's a not-so-easy-going stamina-oriented chart, and lets just say that the added rates only make that all the more noticeable.

Originally released in [Nuclear Blast JS Awesome Bomb Filez 5](https://etternaonline.com/pack/4327), this chart offers everything you'd expect for a stamina-focused marathon to have. At its core, it's just a jumpstream/handstream map. What makes it unique and challenging is its patterning techniques and use of more straining motions all across the chart. Expect a heavy use of anchors and trills all throughout! Just realize that cranking up the speed **won't** make their difficulty scale linearly.

Have fun trying to push your limits.

[lemonguy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4693052) is making his way back into the Loved scene, this time with something that you will mostly recognize from his massive repertoire of tech-heavy maps ‚Äî *Adcar* by Terminal 11!

Massive bursts, minijacks and abrasive patterning, lemonguy created such a high bar to keep you on your toes even until the end of the chart, and with the addition of being featured in the Semifinals of [MWC 4K 2019](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2019_4K#semifinals), plus one of his well-known *Etterna* packs, [Lemon's Fruit Snacks 2](https://etternaonline.com/pack/74846), this is without a doubt a very good addition to the Loved section, with added uprates for you people out there to challenge and test your limits.

Don't forget to give your support on this chart, and cast your vote if you really enjoyed this entry!

What's the best representative of a densely packed, O2Jam-style 4K LN chart out there that has stood the test of time, and been even used in [some popular LN dan courses](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/891157#mania/1862841) that have gained traction within the noodle enjoyer communities? Well, now you don't have to go and search far and wide, because we got something for you that you will recognize immediately, and that is a cool collaboration between [Yururu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4932319) and [ega_tutuko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4771971), which is *Element of SPADA*!

This chart has received numerous praises with how progressive the patterns are, and it reflects on modern-day LN construction over the past few years, and it certainly aged very well as being one of the more casual LN charts to play (despite being heavy in its layering), and tackling this chart to the very end is no easy task. On top of being an already beautiful song to listen to, this chart is also a delight for competitive play to see how far your accuracy can go without absolutely getting blasted by speedier inverses and bursts.

Please do give your support for this amazing collaboration and don't forget to cast your vote on this LN chart if you are in favor of this work of art!

Contrasting [qodtjr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3021168)'s [last Loved nomination](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/621216) and this month's other rice pick, *electro peaceful (akiy2344's 8bit-fuu cover)* is a more approachable chordstream chart, which you might recognize from its use in [Jinjin's Regular Dan 4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/451788#mania/969187) and [last year's MWC](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_7K) (in the Round of 16 pool).

The patterning holds no surprises from anyone familiar with qodtjr's prolific style: consistent chordstreams with some variations and even a couple of held LNs. Will you go for the pass, the S or the SS? Whatever your goal may be, vote now for a chance to compete on a true leaderboard!

After exactly two years of Loved waves, [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092) receives a Loved nomination with his set of *Frontier Explorer*!

This chart of *Frontier Explorer* has a variety of delay and chordstream patterns. There are many rates for those of various skill levels, ranging from those getting into reading very dense chordstreams at a slower BPM, to the greatest ETs like Blocko himself!

While this was originally uploaded to celebrate New Year 2021, there is also a custom 1.05x rate difficulty featured in the Grand Finals pool of [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_7K) featuring only chordstreams. The set as a whole garnered quite a bit of popularity among the people who are capable of playing this.

I don't recommend that you pause for this, as stamina will factor exceptionally heavily in your attempts at this chart. Good luck, and don't forget to vote for *Frontier Explorer*!

Our very own [Remuring](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6522146), who we recently welcomed to the team of osu!mania captains last month, has a map featured in this month's Loved voting: *Ano Yume o Nazotte*!

Created in collaboration with [Pengdoll](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6392061), this has mapping styles you would typically see from both of them. We captains aim to kill two birds with one stone with this nomination, and we feel that this delivers some of the best charting from both creators here. Typical to LN charts like these, you'll see a lot of notes in between columns occupied by LNs, which is great for increasing your finger strength overall.

Aside from the above, we know that many people in the community are fans of YOASOBI's music, so we know those fans will be happy to see another YOASOBI chart in the Loved voting. If you want to see a good LN collaboration practice chart in Loved, or you just want to jam to YOASOBI, remember to give *Ano Yume o Nazotte* your support!
