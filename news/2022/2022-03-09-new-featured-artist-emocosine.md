Jam-packed with energy, **EmoCosine**'s music has finally entered our Featured Artist library!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/246/header.jpg?2022)

**EmoCosine** is a somewhat fresh addition to the rhythm game world. They only earned their status as a prestigious rhythm game song composer in 2018, but since then, their works have been adopted in major titles like *Lanota*, *Muse Dash*, and *SOUND VOLTEX*.

If that's not enough to prove **EmoCosine**'s musical mastery, we've picked out **15** tracks that speak for themselves. [**EmoCosine**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/246) has all of 'em, along with some **2 minute cuts** for some of the coolest tracks!

These songs contrast intense rhythm game tones with **EmoCosine**'s iconic upbeat style, so check out the contrast that skinning can provide through the video below, then listen through the rest of the awesome previews:
