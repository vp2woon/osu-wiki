**Massive New Krew** strides into our Featured Artist catalogue with style!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/318/header.jpg)

Pounding juicy bass since 2008, **Massive New Krew** is a duo of electronic producers who've established themselves as hardstyle icons. They earned their reputation by performing as club DJs at major events throughout Japan and shattering ears in rhythm games like *beatmania IIDX*, *CHUNITHM*, *Groove Coaster*, and *Taiko no Tatsujin*!

**9** booming tunes (with pre-timed map templates) can be found on [**Massive New Krew**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/318)!

**Massive New Krew**'s distinct sound calls for some distinct ways of mapping. [Icekalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5410645) created a map for [Bullsh\*t](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1829152) that sets the stage for **Massive New Krew** on osu!, so take a look at this video (and everything else that's up for grabs):
