Legendary producer **Noisestorm** has been dominating the electronic scene for more than a decade, and starting today, they're going to dominate osu!'s Featured Artist listing too.

As hinted at [earlier](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-11-09-featured-artist-track-updates-monstercat), this announcement marks the end of our [Monstercat](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/255) additions for now.

This collection of songs has been one of our biggest milestones in the Featured Artist collection, so let's hope to see more additions in the future!

In the meantime, prepare for what's coming next in the Featured Artist sphere by tracking the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame), including a new part-livestreamer/part-musician coming up this Saturday!
