**City Girl**'s unorthodox charm graces our Featured Artist library.

Most people would never associate lofi or modern pop with rhythm games, yet **City Girl** is here to prove everyone wrong.

California-based producer **City Girl** has crafted a neat collection of musical adventures with contributions from a diverse set of stunning vocalists. Unbounded by genre and inspired by artists all over the board, **City Girl**'s music is the epitome of unexpected brilliance.

**9** of those adventures are up for grabs from [**City Girl**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/245)!

While these songs aren't nearly as intense as your average rhythm game song, they can still be difficult under the right circumstances. Watch [kurtis-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5477343) play through [City Girl - L2M (feat. Kelsey Kuan)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1668789) with approach rates between 8.5 and 11 (yes, *eleven*), then tap along to these other previews:
