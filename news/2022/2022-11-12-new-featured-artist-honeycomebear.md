**HoneyComeBear** brings a new brand of J-pop to our Featured Artist library.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/319/header.jpg)

Comprised of lyricist/vocalist/composer *Kaako* and composer/producer *Monkey*, **HoneyComeBear** is establishing their place as leaders in the independent J-pop scene. With millions of listens on nearly every song in their discography, the duo knows exactly how to design awesome music.

And given how many awesome beatmaps exist for **HoneyComeBear**'s music already, the osu! community recognizes their talent too.

**7** of these emotive tunes (in pre-packaged beatmap templates) can be found on [**HoneyComeBear**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/319)!

The best way to understand **HoneyComeBear**'s musical mastery is to hear it for yourself. Start by watching this video of [Andrea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/33599)'s beatmap of [SpaceJellyfish](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/811659) showcasing osu!'s different score algorithms, then explore the rest of these maps and previews:
