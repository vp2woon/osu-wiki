Grab a seat, and get ready for some epic Loved nominations!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

To those who're still unfamiliar with what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved Captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As always, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the July votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

230 BPM, 4:09 | 8.30★\
*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

While the name may suggest otherwise, to *Trust Nothing but Love*, adding to that list is to trust Azu with enjoyable maps.

This map is an 8.3\* gauntlet, created originally as a custom NM1 for the WhiteCat Tournament Grand Finals, this map embodies the NM1 spirit. 230 BPM high spacing jumps with cross screens intertwined for 4 minutes, it is difficult to catch a break.

I hope you can find the faith to trust Azu as much as I, and vote this map into Loved!

*description written by [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983)*

As one of the most feared reading challenges that you can come across, this one really is a shock to the *S.Y.S.T.E.M*

A CS5, grid-based map at heart, the non-stop bursts that wiggle, overlap, and stack in all manner of configurations has ktgster written all over it. The complexity of the patterns increase as you pass each part of the song, reaching ludicrous levels of absurdity by the end. The icing on the cake is that it's also AR8, so there are no free passes here — you have to play by it's rules. However, there is an AR9 difficulty as well for those that prefer it.

This has become a go-to for many players looking for an extreme map to test their reading, and it has even seen tournament play at the very highest level. This map is a real piece of work, and it's time to put it up for the Loved vote!

*description written by [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983)*

Calling all stream players! We present to you some melancholic Eurobeat to drift your mouse to.

From one of our featured artists, Camellia brings us this upbeat take on *Baka Mitai*, with sunui and Muukeh bringing this relentless 160 BPM stream map to accompany it. With two full difficulties, both at around 7 stars, this is a true flow aim test. It's loaded with very wide spacing, as well as plenty of kicksliders and zig-zagging streams that will judge your aim control. It may seem extreme, but it's got a smooth feel to it — the sort of flow aim map where you can find yourself hitting even the most extreme looking patterns without expecting it, once you get into the zone.

How do you feel about this absolute banger possibly entering the Loved category? Slide into the voting poll above and let us know!

For our next nomination, we have a delightful EDM showcase for you to sink your teeth into. When these artists come together to make music, only magic can happen, and Juntic has put together a fairly technical map for it that has been a fan favourite for years!

At around 5.4 stars, This map for PSYQUI's remix of *Arigatou Sayonara* is a burst-heavy map has plenty of intensity, without being overwhelming. The kickslider and stream style of this one should be familiar to anyone who has played ranked maps for EDM songs in the last few years. doubles, streams, and high SVs abound, and the aim flow is very smooth. For this difficulty range, this is a nice map to chill out with.

A perfect storm of the right song, the right map, and the right vibe for your multiplayer and solo sessions. Do you think that it deserves a spot in Project Loved? The decision is yours!

*description written by [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983)*

You don't always want to scramble your brain with four-dimensional sliders, or mince your fingers on spaced streams. Sometimes, you just want to vibe out to some future funk. This map for *S o m e o n e S p e c i a l* is exactly what the doctor ordered!

A chill two-difficulty set with a Hard and an Insane, it's a funky map with plenty of 145 BPM bursts and kicksliders. The mapping sticks strongly to the lead hook and vocal chops, which really brings out the funk. Cool overlapping sliders and repeating patterns represent the song wonderfully. Considering this was the mapper's first uploaded map, and it wasn't pushed for ranked much at all, this is an impressive effort.

With over 780,000 plays, and 800 favourites, this one has seriously resonated with players all over the game. After checking this one out, you'll see why. Now is the time to give this map a chance at making it into the Loved category, and the choice is up to you, so vote now!

*description written by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

160 BPM alternating patterns have never been quite as satisfying to play as in this high 6-star Eurobeat banger. At just over 5 minutes in length, this map is perfect for those who want to up their flow aim game, or maybe even challenge their stamina on a map of this caliber.

If you've never heard of this map before, you may quickly find yourself among the hundreds of players who just can't get enough of this map.

Nothing more than a beautiful song... sung by the highly talented Fox Burger King herself.

With two diffs to enjoy this experience twice by Bitcoin and Koalazy, despite the humor layered all over, don't fall short as maps. At a similar 6\* difficulty to each other, you can expect an amazing tech experience in both, with the *Koa%wer* difficulty including 911 sliders that may take you more than one try to figure out.

There's a reason this mapset has grown to popularity, and I wish I could say it is for the song choice alone, so go check it out and vote it for Loved!

If you're looking to train your stamina and maybe even some higher BPM 1/6 skills, look no further than *Parallel Equilibrium* by D3kuu.

*Sabaku de* is a track made by the genius electro-jazz producer Hakushi Hasegawa. With a map of this track already Loved on the circle clicking side of this community, we are happy to bring you Skull Kid's taiko version of this chaotic yet beautiful 4 minutes long song.

Now is time for you to take on the challenge this *Desert* has bestowed to all of us. Good luck, and have fun!

Myckoll is a name that many newer players are sure to recognize, mostly due to his high BPM or SV filled maps, *BLUNTED 4* is a blend of both styles!

*BLUNTED 4* is 256 BPM, this may sound intimidating, but the map is filled with comfortable patterns which makes the map feel very smooth from start to finish, however, the highlight of *BLUNTED 4* is the creative SV, despite it being only 2 minutes long, the map features a lot of variety, from challenging overlaps to a low SV section to a high SV stream in the final quarter of the map, *BLUNTED 4* is sure to test a variety of skillsets while still feeling comfortable and satisfying!

*description written by [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)*

Oh boy, *Scattered Faith* — if you've heard this song before, you probably know what to expect. It has been infamous in the osu! community for a long time, mostly due to the high difficulty of its maps. You may also recognize Kurokotei from *Galaxy Collapse*, another song with similarly difficult maps.

As already said, if you are familiar with the song, then you know this won't be an easy pass. The very high BPM paired with lots of complicated wiggle patterns and hyper chains make this a challenge for pretty much anyone out there. Not to mention that the map is 7 minutes long, which means that if you don't have a good amount of stamina, you might end up failing because you will not be able to keep up. Simply put: this is a true test of skill that might push you to your limits.

Overall, it's a really cool map, so give it a try if you think you have what it takes!

This offers a very high-quality speed map, with non-stop wiggles for 4 minutes straight at this point. And if it's not speedy enough for you due to being only 180 BPM, well, you also have rated up difficulties in this mapset, at 1.1x and 1.2x rates!

Alrighty, so some of you like to jump eh? This one's for you! We haven't seen a Zyzyx map get nominated for quite some time, so we decided it was time to get this funky uptempo cute-core ish map a spot in the limelight. Both of the difficulties on this map are about 7 stars in terms of difficulty, and the core concept is the same for both as mentioned before: jumps. However, there is a difference between them in terms of circle size and approach rate.

Think that the map is a tad bit too easy without any mods? Slap some hard rock on it, it works! Now go play the map and vote, otherwise, the tank is gonna fire at you!

*ANOMALY* may belong to [one of the most notoriously mapped songs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?m=3&q=artist%3Dcamellia%20anomaly&s=any) from Camellia. This Loved feature comes from none other than a quite established name in the SV community: Couil!

As far as raw patterning goes, this is pretty physical, and the SVs themselves are not forgiving either. To give you an idea of how hard this is, this was justifiably featured in the Finals round of MWC2020 alongside [*Galvanize*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1047442#mania/2189426), another Loved SV entry. Compared to its counterpart, *ANOMALY* puts more emphasis on reading and getting the patterns right with all the, ahem, anomalies that the SVs introduce to you throughout all of the song. I wish you the best of luck attempting to tackle this one, this ain't an easy cookie.

Without further ado, cast your vote and start practicing in anticipation of the leaderboards!

To start off, let us welcome Wh1teh back to the Loved polls after quite some time! We originally debated whether having another pack of his would be the best of ideas, but we ended up choosing one of their most liked jack charts: *toby fox's ASGORE*.

As a refresher, this chart uses jacks in a well thought out manner. Despite being such a generalizable pattern, Wh1teh manages to make use of the limited columns and patterns to represent the song in a rather fun manner. Even if 1.0x is too easy for you, you're sure to have your fair share of fun by rating it up a bit!

In any case, making an awesome chart out of an awesome song from an awesome game is everything we probably could've asked for. And we hope the community likes it as much as well.

We believe this chart needs no introduction. Some might have just stumbled upon it on a certain four map marathon course. Others, might have just been recommended to try it out and ended up that stupid green cat in the background. Whatever the reason might be, ilikexd's interpretation of *jea's Makiba* has sure left an impact on most of us playing the game.

Despite being quite a repetitive map patterning wise, its unorthodox trickiness added to the streams holding everything together makes it very unique on its own. It's quite funny how the opinion's on this chart's difficulty are incredibly mixed. Some might brush its difficulty off, while others feel as if it was the bane of their existence.

In any case, this chart has left quite a mark on the community. And no matter whether you've played this already, or if it's the first time you've even played it, we hope for it to be welcomed in the Loved section while offering players a competitive experience!

Our next pick is quite a fun one: *Eiyuu no Uta*!

Valedict hasn't seen a Loved nomination in almost a year, and what better way to bring him back than with a popular and challenging stream file! Despite being on the lighter side of things when it comes to density, it clocks in at 280 BPM (even higher if you're including rates). But a challenging file wouldn't be fun without satisfying patterns to hit, and *Eiyuu no Uta* doesn't fail there either. The many trills, anchors, and rolls outside of the chorus match strongly with the vocals, and the rolly chorus is a ton of fun to play through.

This file has gained a fair amount of popularity whether it be its use in MWC, or appearance in prominent song packs from other rhythm games. We hope that with a great balance between quality and popularity that you'll find it a suitable pick for Loved. Be sure to cast your vote on it today!

Coming back to the Loved nominations is juankristal's chart of *Dansu Nanbaa wo Tomo ni*!

This chart is colloquially known as a release "timing hell", as indicated in the difficulty name. Seeing use in the [finals pool of MWC 4K 2020](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2020_4K), this chart is very difficult to maintain a good ratio on. You will find yourself dropping many more 300s and 200s than you might think. On top of that, this chart is also actually physically straining too, as it clocks in at 296 BPM. There are all sorts of uncomfortable LN patterns to keep you on your toes.

If you want to see this chart in the Loved section, make sure to support juankristal by voting!

[inabakumori - Lost Umbrella (7_7 bootleg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1527363#mania) by [aid\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12808079)\

It's time to introduce another mapper to the loved section, here we propose to you *Lost Umbrella*, by AidBucket aka aid\_ !

A purely rice-focused affair, this chart features pretty dense chordstream at a respectable 190 BPM - expect fat chords, lots of brackets, and just a couple of short breaks in the middle of the barrage of notes thrown at you. It even includes rates up to 1.4, to appeal to the 🦍 demographic among us.

Of course, all this set to a banger remix brought to us by the one and only 7_7, breaking the drums barrier in this attempt of getting a song with a non-taiko leaderboard. Good luck in the polls!

[Camellia - Illegal trap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/756792#mania) by [Flexo123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5367287)\
160 BPM, 3:50 | 7.30★\
*description written by [-NoName-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10400730)*

Flexo123 returns to the Loved voting again with his chart of Camellia's *Illegal trap*!

Now, you might be thinking this is another one of his LN charts, but this is a significantly less common dump-based chart of his. In fact, this chart has exactly 0 LNs in it. This is not easy by any means, and it's especially difficult to maintain good accuracy on it.

If you're interested in seeing more 7K delay/dump in the Loved section, give Flexo your support!

[senya - Friendship](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/901873#mania) by [Chenut BS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10580267)\
145 BPM, 2:58 | 7.21★\
*description written by [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750)*

We're happy to welcome Chenut BS' first nominated map, *Friendship* by senya!

This chart is a very pleasant and fun experience, containing barrages of relatively slow, but dense Long Notes. The chinese mapper used very smooth and comfortable patterning, which is why *Friendship* has gained notable popularity over the years. It will certainly be a good challenge to get a high score on, and top players could comfortably turn on DT as well.

If you love Touhou arranges, noodles, or your friends, you should definitely check out this map and cast your vote!
