The combined efforts of two rhythm game masterminds, **MisoilePunch** joins the lineup our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/239/header.jpg)

**MisoilePunch** is the pet project of *MisomyL* and *Ponchi* — two renowned composers and producers in rhythm game communities. Their works have made a splash in games like *Cytus II*, *O.N.G.E.K.I.*, and *SOUND VOLTEX*, and of course osu! as of today.

Look no further than [**MisoilePunch**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/239) to find **10** high-energy songs catering specifically towards high-energy beatmapping.

Need a refresher? Sample **MisoilePunch**'s sound through a video of [MisoilePunch - DisXloss](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1647720) (just recently ranked by [SMOKELIND](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9327302)!), then tread on over to the rest of the previews below:
