**Ensou** begins a new phase of VOCALOID rock as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/320/header.jpg)

You might recognize Filipino composer/producer **Ensou** from one of the many maps for *COMA* — a song that swept across the rhythm game scene after its inclusion in *Cytus*. Unlike mainstream VOCALOID, **Ensou** also sticks close to home through Tagalog lyrics in most of his songs.

**8** moody rock masterpieces can be found on [**Ensou**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/320)!

Check out some of these moody rock tunes for yourself through this showcase of osu!(lazer)'s argon skin for osu! and osu!taiko, along with previews for a few more awesome tracks:
