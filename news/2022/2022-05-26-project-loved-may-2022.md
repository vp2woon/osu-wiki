With the great hurdles of spring overcome, take a break from studies with Project Loved!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)

For those unfamiliar, Project Loved hosts monthly votings to decide which nominated maps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). You can click on each of the map's banners in this post to go to its poll on the forums, or visit [the forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) for a list of all of the polls. Polls will be open for 10 days, so make sure to cast your votes in time! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh)!

First, thanks for your participation in last month's voting—summaries of the results can be found in the following forum posts:

- [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/8615510)
- [osu!taiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/8615509)

After over two years of dedicated captain-ship to Project Loved, this month [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598) decided to step down from his role in osu!catch. Make sure there's no shortage of thanks going his way if you appreciated his work!

Similarly, [hypercyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9155377) spent nearly two years contributing his effort to Loved by correcting metadata of nominated maps, but recently retired from both here and the NAT. [radar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7131099) and [Yasuho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8458835) began work in the same area this month to fill the gap!

Another development you may have been wondering about is that [survey Project Loved ran at the end of February](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-02-27-project-loved-community-survey). While there are still no concrete plans made based on the results, [you can view those results on the Project Loved website](https://loved.sh/survey/community-feedback-february-2022). I'm still working on options for filtering and comparing the data there; if there's anything you have a hard time finding from the existing graphs, let me know in the `#osu-loved` channel of the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy).

Other than that, it's business as usual. Read about and vote on the maps below, and check out the [Project Loved website](https://loved.sh) if you're interested in helping curate these nominations!

*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

Lost to time from an older age, yet rising from the flames reviving once again in 2019, this set is another classic jump set from Ciyus Miapah. With 6 maps ranging from 2.08 to 7.05 stars, 220 BPM and a varying runtime around 4 minutes, this set provides a lot.

Whether you are looking for some of his classic jump patterns, a variety of bizarre hitsounding, or a full set of this great song, you have found your place. With a slow start and end, the middle stands out with its buildup to cross-screen jumps that spike the difficulty. So I implore, why not check yourself to see why this set had gained the popularity it once had?

Here is one you might have seen before, but not tried yourself. Numerous clips of top-level players attempting this made the rounds on social media not too long ago. However, this infamous challenge map is more than a place to farm Twitch highlights.

It is certainly not the most polished of mapsets, but in terms of gameplay, *GOODBOUNCE* is an absolute treat. Hosted by veteran player EmertxE, it contains three challenging difficulties, but the asdf difficulty is by far the most well known. It is a quintessential graveyard boss map. The asdf difficulty is chock-full of creative gimmicks that look insane at first glance, but feel so nice to play once you get the handle on it. The slider shapes are bonkers, and the stream patterning is brutal, but the most recognizable part is the infamous doubletap note section. It forces you to singletap 180 BPM doubles and triples on tough repeating aim shapes in order to hold combo through it. It is one of my favourite examples of such a gimmick.

If you can manage the stern difficulty, this is one of the most fun maps that you'll play that doesn't even have a background! Why not give it a try yourself and see what the fuss is about?

You can never go wrong with a lapix stomper, and this quality technical stream set for *Foolish Hero (FutureCore Mix)* really does the song justice!

A popular set among multiplayer-goers, and occasionally in tournament play, Jean-Michel Jr and company have put together a challenging cutstream set that does not let off the gas for three and a half minutes. It is full of quad and double cutstream patterns set at 175 BPM, accompanied by a dusting of technical slider mapping. Most of this five-difficulty set is rated at around 5 - 6.5 stars, all with their own take on the technical stream theme. Each of them culminates into a huge drop section at the end of the song, and the complex shapes all step up a gear to match.

This is an absolute must-have for anyone who enjoys cutstream-heavy mapping, and what's not to like? Give us your vote on whether we should add this set to Loved!

*description written by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

As one of the most classic graveyarded chiptune songs, *ukigumo* stands out as a breath of fresh air. The mapping style is as innocent as 2013 gets, featuring mostly aim patterns as it builds up to a flow aim climax at the end. The difficulty spread of this mapset is also quite unique—there are 5 difficulties total, each with different ARs.

While this may sound quite common, this mapset takes it a step further and has slowed-down versions of the map to be played with DT such that the original map can be played at AR 10.3 and AR 11. For all of you high-AR enthusiasts out there, this mapset is definitely your calling, but even if you're not built for high AR, this mapset is nothing but innocent fun for everyone.

This map needs only two letters to describe it, repeated a few times—bibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibibi...

Made by SnowNiNo_, *Bi* is a strange song made by our very own Featured Artist [Rish](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/181). Sitting at 7.63 stars, 169 BPM, and a short runtime of 1:54 minutes, this is a strange concoction of very spaced flow aim, cutstreams, and even back-and-forths, giving this map hefty difficulty for any who dares to try. Despite all of this, the map really hits a fun zone that not many others can accomplish, and I hope to see this in the Loved category soon!

*description written by [UberFazz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8646059)*

A song that lies among the greats in osu! history, Camellia's *OOPARTS* is immediately recognizable to casual and hardcore players alike. Serving as a custom song for [OWC 2020](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2020) by the rhythm game legend himself, this song garnered a wealth of attention when it was first announced. That being said, it should be no surprise that a wide array of mappers picked up the song and tried mapping it themselves.

This fascinating collab by xArief and many others takes this song and puts it to its absolute extremes, harboring nearly 200 favorites despite the fact. At a whopping 11 stars, this will be a challenge even to the most capable players we know, but at least you'll be accompanied by a slick storyboard along the way. Good luck.

*description written by [Boaz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13302996)*

cdh returns to the taiko Loved scene with yet another gimmick map! *How Are You* was featured in [the osu!taiko World Cup 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2021) and goes down in TWC history as one of the most creative FreeMod picks in the series. Usually we only see gimmick maps like this in the NoMod section of tournament pools, but the TWC 2021 poolers really spiced up their finals pool with this amazing map.

*How Are You* already starts off quite silly with some ninja notes and sliders, but it gets even crazier as the map progresses. Soon enough in the map you'll be dealing with mind-boggling overlaps and a fairly unique use of barlines. The barlines in the first and second kiai show you a sequence of notes you'll have to remember and play 1 second later. If you thought it couldn't get any harder, this map also features a brutal low-SV section and a tri-colored stream. I highly recommend you check this map out at least once if you enjoy gimmick maps!

The set has 5 engaging diffs made by hoku, each being a different song by YAOSOBI, which will definitely leave you with a ^-^ expression after trying them out. hoku is a mapper who is able to make players enjoy their maps even if the track is not of their taste, so whether you are a YAOSOBI fan or just an average drum basher, this mapset is for you, so check it out now!

*description written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

Every time we see a new HiroK map on a Frums song, we can't help but think about how it is a perfect match in every possible sense. HiroK's mapping style aligns so perfectly with that chill vibe with chaotic beats that Frums is known for, and *Q.E.* is one of his very best.

With multiple tricky patterns consisting of 1/6 and 1/8 bursts and a handful of odd snappings, this makes for one of the hardest tech maps focused on raw reading skill, which is then further exploited by a tasteful usage of SV to emphasize sections properly, making this very sweet to play from start to end.

So, if you're up for the task, you should really give this a try!

*Nageki no Hana (Slax Remix)* is a very popular map among taiko players. I often see various taiko players pick and play this map in multi mode. The fact that it is loved by such a wide variety of players must mean that the map is that good. The BPM is fast (270), but there are many basic patterns, so this is a good speed map for intermediate to advanced players to practice. 1/6 is not included at all, only 1/4 is used, so it is recommended for those who are not good at fast maps and want to improve.

If you're looking for a way to hone your taiko skills, why not play this map?

Taiko players in the house tonight, *loli rockers* by uone is up for voting this month! The map is filled with comfortable patterns in the style uone is well known for; it's also a lot easier than the typical Loved maps we see nowadays, featuring only short 1/4 bursts and a few 1/6 in the entire map. However, that is not to say the map is a breeze, as there are finishers and slightly unconventional 1/6 patterns to look out for.

Despite being on the easier side for Loved and despite the map not containing any SV changes, this map of *loli rockers* fits the song well and is very fun and engaging from start to finish. Have a good time!

This month we have not one newcomer to the Loved category, but two (and yet another one in one of the later picks!): -Joakh and -Rustyy! If you have played osu!catch before, you must have played at least one map from each of them. Both have created an insane amount of beatmaps, ranging from Cups to Rains and Deluge difficulties.

Both of the difficulties here are very well mapped and provide you with a real challenge. The difficulty itself is pretty well balanced in my opinion. Once the kiais hit, however, you have to kick it up a notch, as they speed up quite a bit and give you very little room to breathe.

Excuse my rudeness, but could you please cast your vote? <3

This map takes any osu!catch player to one hellish ride, with the first two kiai sections riddled with relatively hard antiflow patterns, jumps and bursts, and the map does not stop the intensity it pulls out in the slightest, even up to the very end, with the nastiest burst right at the end, ready to kill players.

This month we have a new face in the Loved category: Unlucky_w, formerly known as FastYoshi. And oh boy, this map is really interesting.

First of all, this is perhaps one of the catchiest songs ever, and for that reason a good selling point for restarting the map over and over again until you can't get it out of your head. But not only that, the map itself is also catchy in a sense. It flows really well and fits the song nicely, highlighting the key parts of it. It also plays differently from most of the other maps of this day and age but in a really good way. It is not an easy map, but a very doable one with some practice.

Truly a hidden gem, you should definitely give it a try (and get addicted to the song along the way).

Right, let's keep this one short. You know Kukkai by now. No, actually, you love Kukkai by now. We know you do. So here's another one of their maps! *Bad Apple* is one of the most popular songs in the osu! community, so a Camellia remix (of all things) of it will never be received in a bad manner by you lovely people.

This map is pure quality, despite the fact that it has some quirky streaming patterns in combination with some of the drops in the song. But hey, that's what Loved is for, right?! We are sure you'll like it. The only thing to note is that this is a relatively difficult map (though not extreme), so only fairly advanced players allowed for this one!

lemonguy is returning to Loved with our next nomination, *9mm*!

Nothing can overstate how versatile lemonguy is as a mapper, and *9mm* accentuates that perfectly. We've seen many different maps of his go up over the years, all highlighting different skillsets, whether it's the tricky LN releases of [Daisycutter](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1307846) or the heavy-handed tech featured in [Please Don't Remember](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/809304) (both of which you should play if you haven't, by the way!).

*9mm* takes a bit of a step back from these mapping styles and goes for a much more relaxed, bouncy feel. You'll find a multitude of fun patterns throughout this map, including very light dumpstreams, unintrusive short LNs, and slow minijacks. All of these come together to create a very smooth map that's charted to the perfect song to get you absolutely pumped while playing.

*9mm* has gained quite a following over the years, and for good reason! Be sure to cast your vote for it in this wave of Project Loved.

It took some months for them to come back into the spotlight, but they make a strong reappearance in the Loved polls: \[Crz\]Rachel is yet again offering the community one of their well-known chordjack charts, this time senya's *Melody Blooming in the Earth*!

To be frank, it has been fairly difficult to choose something from them as they have tons of charts loved by the community. However, we believe that the rate accessibility of this chart in particular might be more enjoyed across the board! As a player, you should expect heavily anchored sections, a recurring motif in the chart. These will surely spice up the experience, so get ready to constantly be on edge getting used to controlling them!

Other than that, not much else can be said. Just a gamer tip: try hitting the note. It tends to work fairly well.

[Rish feat. Choko - Bi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1012105#mania) by [Raveille](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1388767)\
169 BPM, 1:54 | 4.94★\
*description written by [Paturages](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479)*

Contrary to popular assumption(?), this song is not about the "B" of LGBT, nor is it about the letter "B" itself, the insect known as "bee" or its dedicated movie, or even the 🅱️ emoji. There's only one way to find out whether or not Unicode emojis work in news posts, let's see how this goes.

*Bi*, or *び*, has one syllable more prevalent than the others throughout all of its length. You can go ahead and guess which one. In typical Raveille fashion, this map showers you with a stout density of long notes and will test your ability to read through them before testing your ability to actually play them.

As a featured map in the [MWC 2020 quarterfinals](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2020_4K), this would add to the mid-to-high level of density-oriented long note catalogue of the Loved section. Speaking of which, this is not Raveille's first long note Loved entry, and some of his prouder charts like [Delrio](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1251408) or [Mare Maris](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/917906) have even gone as far as getting ranked! The popularity aspect of *Bi*, however, had us interested in including it in the Loved section.

[Camellia - liquated](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/789869#mania) by [-MysticEyes](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6253266)\

For a decent amount of time, -MysticEyes has been a reliable source of maps of both convincing quality and adventurous ambition. With no less than 15 ranked mapsets and [one Loved LN entry](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/800341), -MysticEyes has experimented and played around with a lot of different mapping styles and skillset focuses.

As such, *liquated* is a surprising entry. Its focus resides in something that has been a bit popular lately in the ranking section: stream dumps. You would not expect to find such a map in -MysticEyes's repertoire, especially not in 2018. At that point in time, it would have been less imaginable to rank this type of map, and as much as we would like to see this resurface there in 2022, this map will have to remain a testament of the past.

Despite not being featured in any major way and being more than 4 minutes long, it has nonetheless amassed a fair amount of spontaneous popularity, enough for us to consider this for the Loved section. Give this one a try—you will be delightfully surprised, as this plays quite smoothly throughout all its length. Don't forget to hit us with a vote afterwards!

H1Pur finally makes his entrance to the Loved section! As an up and coming mapper who has recently been contributing to a number of tournaments with tasteful SV mapping, starting with [SVSE](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1313374), he is also perhaps the best known enthusiast of Amelia Watson we know in the osu!mania community. Feel free to prove us wrong in the voting thread.

*GIMME DA BLOOD* made its first appearance in SVSE as a custom map, and was then brought back again in [MWC 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2021_4K). It's an honest and accessible reading-oriented early-game SV pick that you may find yourself headbanging to instead of actually learning. Watch out for those BPM changes, they can be a bit finicky to learn!

Look, I know that you can only vote once, but: *One for the blood, two for the life... GIMME DA VOTES!*

ruka has become a household name in the 7K LN mapping community. We decided to nominate another crowd-favourite of theirs, *Ko Inu*!

This mapset consists of a highly LN-oriented 4K GD by Lung_P, a hybrid-style 7K GD by sankansuki, and ruka's collab with emO_Oticon which features very dense LN patterning, especially in the second half. Combined with the high intensity of the song, this mapset is a very memorable experience. If you share similar thoughts, consider voting for *Ko Inu*!

It's been years since we've seen something from c36098651 go up for voting, but now is the time. We introduce his chart of M2U's *The Queen* for voting!

This chart is another look at the older style of LN mapping from back in the day. A lot of the patterning (particularly towards the beginning) is deceptively tricky with staggered release timings. However, because of this, this chart is good to practice these staggered releases without too much else going on. For anyone approaching medium-level proficiency in LNs, this chart is for you.

If you like what you see here, don't forget to try c36098651's other charts too! A lot of his charts go underappreciated. Remember to cast your vote for *The Queen*!

The \[To You x0.9\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063)*

I'd like to bring forth another freshman in Project Loved this month around, which is none other than GoosBaams with their interpretation of seatrus' *Dancing In The Blue*!

While we're going to be skipping its x0.9 downrate, you won't be missing anything. The fun assortment of chordstreams sprinkled with other decorative patterns makes this chart a fun way to try your hands on this type of layering. Moreover, with the addition of uprates, we're more than sure that there's going to be something for everyone to enjoy and compete on.

If you like what you see here, we also suggest checking out [GoosBaams's Seatrus 7K Pack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1589557), where you'll be able to find more charts of a similar vein!

---

From [everyone working on Project Loved](https://loved.sh/team), we hope you enjoyed this month's selection, and are looking forward to the next! The favoured beatmaps will hit the [Loved beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved) shortly after the polls end.

More info about Project Loved can be found on its [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh). Stop by the `#osu-loved` channel of the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) if you have any questions, concerns, or are interesting in helping out.

See you next month!
