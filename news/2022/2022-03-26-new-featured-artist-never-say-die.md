**Never Say Die Records** provides a heap of new talents as the latest addition to our Featured Artist catalogue!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/251/header.jpg)

Calling **Never Say Die** a "Featured Label" would be a lot more accurate. **Never Say Die** is a record label from London, England, who's been proliferating the dubstep scene since their inception in 2009. With familiar names like *Eptic*, *MUST DIE!*, and our very own [Zomboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/224) on their roster, there's a strong chance you're familiar with something they have to offer.

**9** new bass-pounding tracks are up for grabs from [**Never Say Die**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/251), including the classic [Cutline - Die For You (ShockOne Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/155285).

Words are dumb. Use your ears:

More songs from even *more* artists can be found on [**Never Say Die**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/251). Should we call it a Featured Label listing? Probably. But we won't.

Completely shifting moods, the next artist we'll be announcing is an upbeat J-rock/pop unit. Keep an eye on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) next Wednesday to find out who that could be.

See you then!
