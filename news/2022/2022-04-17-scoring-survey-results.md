A few weeks ago, we asked for your thoughts on how scoreboards should be handled in the future as a part of the [community meetings recap newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-03-07-community-meetings-recap).

[peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) and [smoogipoo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1040328) went through the results together during the [community meeting on April 3](/wiki/Community/osu!_community_meetings) if you're interested in hearing some live commentary from the game's developers on the topic.

Otherwise, here's a brief summary of the responses:

- Most respondents had used lazer at least once before.
- Scores showing on beatmap leaderboards and awarding pp were rated as the main features missing that would get people to switch over for good. Lazer's performance was the third most pressing concern, followed by skinning support for song select and rankings, better filtering options for song select, and finally a feature-complete beatmap editor.
- An overwhelming majority of respondents use lazer because they like both the new features and its design.
- Most respondents felt positive about lazer overall, though the proportion of people still on the fence is significantly larger than those who feel strongly positive about it.
- Opinions on how lazer scores should be shown in stable were cleanly split, with the community firmly divided between combining leaderboards and having separate ones.
- However, a significant majority of respondents felt that scores set in stable should be visible with scores set on lazer in the lazer client.
- A narrow majority of respondents prefer sorting per-beatmap leaderboards by score, and then by pp. Only a tiny minority of people prefer sorting by accuracy.
- An overwhelming majority of respondents prefer to filter per-beatmap leaderboards with all mods (and multipliers) visible, similar to how the global leaderboard works on stable.
- Most respondents felt that classic mod scores set in lazer should be shown on the main leaderboard.
- Nine out of ten respondents were fine with classic mod being automatically applied to old scores set on stable.
- At all levels, the respondents were very open to changing just about every facet of scoring as required.
- Only a very narrow majority respondents were fine with the order of scores in beatmap leaderboards changing as required, with a large swathe unsure, and only a very small minority feeling negatively about it.
