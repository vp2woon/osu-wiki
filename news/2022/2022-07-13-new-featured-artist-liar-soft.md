A flock of *Rita* songs join osu! through **Liar-soft**, the newest addition to our Featured Artists!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/283/header.jpg?2022)

Okay, fine. **Liar-soft** isn't exactly an *artist*. They're a game studio, but since their founding in 1999, each of their 42 works include outstanding theme songs, so we're more than happy to pull a bunch of them into the osu! ecosystem.

That said, **15** of those outstanding songs are ready for mapping from [**Liar-soft**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/283)!

One of those songs is the legendary [dorchadas](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=dorchadas): a song with [4 ranked sets](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=dorchadas&s=ranked) and [a classic Loved beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/686649) that has shaped an entire generation of slidershape connoisseurs.

Surely you know the song already, but that shouldn't stop you from watching through this quick *dorchadas* video and exploring the remaining songs!
