**Raimukun** crashes into our Featured Artist library!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/247/header.jpg)

**Raimukun** is part of a new generation of rhythm game song producers. Taking influence from legends like [*xi*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/727) and *Sakuzyo* when learning to compose his tunes, **Raimukun** aims to replicate their intensity while also challenging himself through experimentation.

**7** distinctly powerful tracks are now available from [**Raimukun**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/247), including his iconic *BMS OF FIGHTERS* submissions!

The newest of those submissions is [Firmament star](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1633703) (rendered for osu!catch by [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134)). If you're one of the 3 people who've ever wondered how an osu!catch map coverts to circle clicking, this video will satisfy all of your curiosities. Once you're done, check out everything else below:

[**Raimukun**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/247) is the only place you need to be right now. Take a crack at mapping with any of our super convenient pre-timed beatmap templates, then consider why you hadn't started learning to map earlier.

The week may be done, but more music is on its way pronto. We'll be launching next Wednesday with an artist that literally *every* osu! player should know by now, so stay tuned to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) and we'll see you then.
