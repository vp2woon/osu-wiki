While LAN events are nothing new to the osu! scene, [**The Roundtable**](/wiki/Tournaments/The_Roundtable) pushes boundaries with an incredibly stacked roster of players!

This **3 day** event from July 8-10 features **3 different tournaments**, all streamed from [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691)'s [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/BTMC) with comfy couch commentary and personal interactions with everyone involved!

### 16 player battle royale

Kicking off **The Roundtable** is a [**16 player battle royale**](/wiki/Tournaments/The_Roundtable/16_player_battle_royale)!

The LAN setup has 8 computers, so the players will be randomized into two groups of 8. Each group will play **7** maps in a multiplayer lobby, and the lowest scorer of each map will be eliminated.

Once both groups have been narrowed down to a single player, the finalists will face head to head in a **best of 13 competition!**

### 2v2 team tandem tournament

The event's second day launches with an unorthodox [**2v2 team tandem tournament**](/wiki/Tournaments/The_Roundtable/2v2_team_tandem_tournament).

Honestly speaking, this is more about having fun than competition. "Tandem" in this context means there will be **two players clicking circles on one setup** — one aiming and the other tapping!

Players will form four groups of four and face off in a single elimination tournament — until the last group remains as the victor.

### 1v1 double elimination tournament

The main event of **The Roundtable** is a high stakes [**1v1 double elimination tournament!**](/wiki/Tournaments/The_Roundtable/1v1_double_elimination).

This tournament will last two days: The first day of matches will determine the Top 8 players, while the second day is reserved for illustrating the talents of the best players at **The Roundtable.**

This classic 1v1 has the largest set of prizes, so expect to see players perform — in person — at the highest caliber.

## Players

So who's coming to this thing anyways?

**15** of North America's strongest competitors have been invited, including former and current [OWC](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC) champions.
