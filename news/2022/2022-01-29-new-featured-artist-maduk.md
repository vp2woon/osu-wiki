Our latest Featured Artist **Maduk** is here to fully submerge your eardrums in liquid drum & bass!

Drum & bass has almost always been a staple in our circle clicking game. The genre offers a perfect stream-to-jump ratio at a familiar ~174 BPM, all while being a pleasure to listen to.

**Maduk** can be credited for much of the success of drum & bass on osu!. [Ghost Assassin](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/198820) has collected literally *millions* of plays since being ranked in 2014, setting the stage for hundreds of drum & bass maps that came soon after.

And that's only the tip of the iceberg. We have **21** tracks up and ready for mapping from [**Maduk**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/235)!

In case you *somehow* haven't heard the timeless classic yet, shove your face into this video of [Ghost Assassin](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/198820) showcasing a few skins from the ongoing [winter-themed skinning contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/137), then take a listen to the rest of the previews below:

If you're on the fence about mapping one of **Maduk**'s songs, it's time to pick a side. [His Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/235) includes pre-timed map templates for all the songs above (and more), so we believe the decision will be fairly easy.

We're not really sure how to describe our next Featured Artist, so we won't even try. Stay tuned to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) next Wednesday. It'll be special.
