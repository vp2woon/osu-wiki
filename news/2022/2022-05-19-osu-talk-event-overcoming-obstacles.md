Mark your calendars, set your alarms, and join us for the first ever osu! talk event, where you can make your voice heard.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-05-19-osu-talk-event-overcoming-obstacles/ote-newspost-banner.png)

Unlike many events that involve guest speakers, this one is open for anyone to speak — all you need is a story to share. Each event centers around a certain theme, and for this iteration, all talks will have the theme of **overcoming obstacles**.

Here's a rundown of how the event works:

- **The event will last 3 days total**, from May 20 - 22, 2022.
- **The speaker will use a Discord stage channel** in the [official osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) to give their talk.
- **Talks will be less than 18 minutes long.** This is the maximum allowed length, not a goal to aim for — even a 3-minute talk can have massive impact.
- The stories shared do not necessarily have to be about osu!, but because this is an osu!-related event, speakers are recommended to try connecting their story or the lesson behind it to osu! in some way.

Below is the talk schedule for the event, including the speaker's username and the name of their talk. All talks will be streamed live on [osu! University's Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/osuuniversity) and uploaded separately to [osu! University's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/osuuniversity) after the event. You can also tune in live through a Discord stage channel in the [official osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy).
