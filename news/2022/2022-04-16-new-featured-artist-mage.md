We don't mince words around here. If you've played any stream map in the last year, you've probably heard of **Mage**. More specifically, you've almost certainly heard [The Words I Never Said in D&B](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1470072), which has amassed literally *millions* of plays in the past few months and earned 4th place [2021's Community Choice](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/138).

Beyond that, **Mage** is an ultra-talented smooth drum & bass producer and we've snagged **5** of their tunes for your mapping enjoyment (including the song above, of course).

Take a dive into [**Mage**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/258) for the full list, but first explore some samples through this consistency-focused video and these other previews:
