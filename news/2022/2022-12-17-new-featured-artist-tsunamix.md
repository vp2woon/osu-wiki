It's a proven fact that osu! players will never grow tired of *Touhou* music, so Japanese producer **tsunamix** from *AGGRESSIVE BEAT CIRCLE* is here to satisfy your every desire. Known for a growing collection of beatmaps for [Period. ~ Seishin no Kousoku to Jiyuu o Tsukamu Jouka](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=%22Period.%20~%20Seishin%20no%20Kousoku%20to%20Jiyuu%20o%20Tsukamu%20Jouka%22) under the alias *tsunamix_underground*, **tsunamix** has become a cult classic here on osu!.

Now it's your job to grow their beatmap catalogue by mapping any of the **10** tunes on [**tsunamix**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/329).
