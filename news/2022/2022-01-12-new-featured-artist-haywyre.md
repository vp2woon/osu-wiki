A monument to contemporary dance music, **Haywyre** joins our Featured Artist library!

**Haywyre** is one of those musicians who feels almost too famous to really be part of our humble circle-clicking game.

This grammy-nominated producer and pianist has toured with the likes of *Zedd* and *GRiZ* thanks to the distinct vision he puts forth with each of his electronic tunes. Inspired by creators like our very own [KOAN Sound](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/49) and various classical composers/pianists, **Haywyre**'s one-of-a-kind sound is surprisingly well suited for the world of rhythm gaming.

**13** tracks are on the table today, each of which has a beatmap template ready to go from [**Haywyre**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/230)!

Curious where the hype behind **Haywyre** comes from? His presence on osu! started with a fairly popular marathon of [Everchanging](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/461903), later expanding even more through competition on [Insight](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/848400)'s nearly inhuman jumps. See exactly what that means by watching [Vaxei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4787150) SS it below, then explore the other songs:
