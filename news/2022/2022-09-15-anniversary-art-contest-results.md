After some of the largest voting turnout we've seen in a long time, the results of the 15th Anniversary Art Contest have made their way into a main menu near you!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/Dreamxiety.jpg)

With **86** artists putting their best foot forward, it was never going to be an easy contest to decide, and when people asked us to increase the votes from 10 to 15, the future was all but set in stone.

**14,930** voters made their preferences known across a wide variety of pieces exploring osu!'s (quite literally) colourful history, and now we have finalists to crown.

We'll be getting stuck straight into the voting results below — but wait, there's a twist! The observant among you may have noticed that we've got far more than the standard 15-20 entries that usually make it in, and that's because we've got an extra *six* courtesy of peppy himself this time around.

Read on to see how it all goes!

## Community Vote

With a whopping **7912** votes, it's safe to say that [**Dreamxiety**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233)'s beautifully illustrated take on pippi enjoying some key moments from osu!'s teenaged history was a smash hit. Some of the biggest community references made a cameo appearance, from the venerable Big Black to the mighty three numbers (you'll know it when you see it) and even a sneaky nod to our /r/place showings over the years.

A simply superb entry well deserving of first place - congratulations, Dreamxiety!

Sporting some serious style, **7248** voters got down with [**illuminae2005**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/29866964)'s rendition of pippi and Mocha sporting some similarly serious attitude. Memorable maps in multitude build brilliant backing for this wonderful piece, and we're excited to see how it'll look on the main menu.

Judging from the vote numbers, we think you will be too!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/urgutz.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/urgutz.png)

Dimly lit by their phone screens, **6671** voters made their support known for [**urgutz**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11731553) showcase of pippi, Chirou, Aiko and a don all prepare to play some osu! on the go and what looks like an ancient version of the old community-made iOS version.

Take a moment to consider that with osu!(lazer) in full swing, the future is going to contain a *lot* more mobile-based users. What will we think about this at our 20th or even 30th anniversary? Only time will tell!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/mjk.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/mjk.png)

**6517** voters showed up to [**mjk**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19607673)'s take on a bacon-munching pippi and a baguette-wielding Mocha enjoying some anniversary celebrations with a few popular community icons in tow. A few of them might even be hiding in plain sight...

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/Kitcat.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/Kitcat.png)

**6189** minds were blown with [**Kitcat**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/30329028)'s delightfully stylized on the whole official mascot crew (and Chirou too!) posing for the celebration. Beyond being just an absolute treat to simply *look* at, the mascot characterisation here is outright exceptional. Seriously. It's fantastic.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/DGen.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/DGen.png)

**6164** voters shot their stars at [**DGen**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13290907)'s very pointy homage to Freedom Dive, featuring pippi and Mocha in appropriate costumes. Aspire to be as the don is — lost in a blissful gaze towards the heavens... if you can somehow ignore the mascots in front of you!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/ZunK.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/ZunK.png)

It's chibi time with [**ZunK**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1070783)'s entry, earning the approval of **5777** voters. All of the main crew's here and even a few extras you might spot too, including a few hidden ones. pippi's also rocking a gamer headset, that's how you know things are serious.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/RedcXca.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/RedcXca.png)

**5343** voters couldn't spot the impostor in [**RedcXca**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14056601)'s entry. What fitting way to celebrate osu!'s 15th anniversary than with a subtle (and not-so-subtle) variety of references to things people love?

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/not%20slepp.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/not%20slepp.png)

**4859** voters saw [**not slepp**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14406940)'s rendition of the timeless Rockefeller Street beatmap background and immediately lost hope of getting it out of their head again for the next three hours. Mocha and Alisa took up the mantle of swimsuit-wearing foxgirl ninjas set behind a starry winter night's sky because... well, because the beatmap is from 2011 and that's just how we did things back then. History!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/Ztalx.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/Ztalx.png)

**4683** voters gave their thumbs-up for [**Ztalx**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7614399)'s take on high school-aged mascots (because the game is quite literally, the age of an average high school student at this point) enjoying a walk down memory lane, which does in fact appear to be a shopping boulevard instead.

There's a *lot* going on in this one if you look. We won't make the when you see it joke again, we promise.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/ShovelKun.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/ShovelKun.png)

Bringing some serenity to the running, **4679** voters stood still for [**ShovelKun**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9948284)'s pippi to take a picture. And what a picture it is indeed. Just stunning, really.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/SvenJing.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/SvenJing.png)

**4250** votes soared upon a breeze with [**SvenJing**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11215996)'s bewinged, hoodie-toting and pen-wielding pippi preparing to exit this earth's *atomosphere* with two Freedom Dive arrow-blob-things in tow. Yes, we know what this is a reference to, but can you fault us for sneaking another one in there?

By the way, we see what you did there with that sneaky but simplistic 15th anniversary hoodie. Hmm.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/ksenikust.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/ksenikust.png)

**4082** voters dove freely into [**ksenikust**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8938068)'s take on a winged and costumed pippi themed after you guessed it, Freedom Dive! Simple, clean and effective. Alarmingly so, in fact. pippi looks far more suited to bright orange than you might originally expect.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/MeowMiaw.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/MeowMiaw.png)

**4013** heads turned at [**MeowMiaw**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23071617)'s slightly-too-real rendition of osu!'s favourite mini-game: **rage**. No game mode is safe from its appearance, nor are they safe from the ever-present shitmiss. This being said, MeowMiaw did a *fantastic* job at comedically portraying it all with some of the best chibi work we've seen featured in an art contest for quite a while.

We'd also like to note that Mari's look in the bottom right is how she feels whenever Mani is in the general vicinity.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/TJ_25.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/TJ_25.png)

**4010** voters emphasised with [**TJ_25**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18470896)'s pippi lounging around at the main menu. Have you ever truly played osu! if you haven't sat at the main menu feeling the cookie pulse in time with your heart after you've either just set your top score, or *nearly* set it?

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/Feryquitous.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/Feryquitous.png)

**3894** voters took a trip down-town with [**Feryquitous**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5152999)' most urbane pippi waiting at a metro station, sporting some serious peppy swag (the light mode cap and definitely-not-Supreme hoodie sure have it, no cap). Unfortunately, pippi's looking a little low on osu! coins, so maybe she'll have to wait for next year's April Fools to restock on them... if we're all so lucky as to be blessed with them again.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/Son%20Goku.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/Son%20Goku.png)

**3882** people marvelled at [**Son Goku**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14991975)'s entry, showcasing a broad selection of mascots (both community and official), and some cameos from Ryūta and Agent J themselves. If there was ever a pastiche to highlight the glorious chaos that is the osu! community, this one would be really up there.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/Sense%20of%20Wonder.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/Sense%20of%20Wonder.png)

**3419** voters laid in wait with [**Sense of Wonder**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3078282)'s historical and modern pippi twins preparing a surprise anniversary ambush for a hoodie-toga'd marble bust of Dean "peppy" Herbert and more osu!-related community references than you can throw a stick at.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/Henter_K.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/Henter_K.png)

**3116** cultured individuals witnessed [**Henter_K**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25219714)'s reimagining of the beatmap background for Yoru Naku Usagi wa Yume o Miru. This one is a bit of an unsung hero in my view, a beautifully rendered take on a classic beatmap background with plenty of added charm.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/NandoFernandez.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/NandoFernandez.png)

**3114** voters got lost in a time portal with [**NandoFernandez**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10614731)'s psychedelic entry. Mocha appears to have broken the time-space continuum again as the game mode mascots and a few more play witness to the end of time. Or perhaps it is indicative of osu! all but consuming your free time the moment you open it. We bet plenty of you have been there — we sure have!

## peppy's Picks

Not merely content with twenty finalist entries, peppy took it upon himself to decree that we will also have an extra privileged six chosen by him simply because he was stunned they didn't make it in. It's his big day too, after all!

And so it was written.

And so *these* descriptions will also be written, courtesy of the Dean "peppy" Herbert himself (in no particular order):

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/Amplui.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/Amplui.png)

I love the concept of the don taiko blimp surrounded by all these memories! Even my own head is there! All floating magically above a cityscape. This is the kind of art that I can stare at and drift off into my own thoughts while reminiscing over how far we've come.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/gilly_potato.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/gilly_potato.png)

This just has such an awesome feel to it. Incorporating many game elements in their actual locations and working the mascots into the scene just works for me.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/IsaIsa1911.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/IsaIsa1911.png)

It's very clear that the artist behind this one has been on their own journey in the osu! community, with so many hidden references across such a broad range of game elements, community events and beatmap cameos. I love that it's basically a re-imagination of the title screen itself, and very much dig the colourful and unique art style.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/McFriedFries.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/McFriedFries.png)

I love watercolour style artwork. I also really like how subtle the references are here, and how well they are worked into the scene. Just has an overall confluence to it.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/pelin.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/pelin.png)

It's an osu! world map! I've always wanted to dabble into a more story-based mode for osu! and this tickles that urge somewhat.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/banners/YOOKA.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/winners/YOOKA.png)

How did this not get in the top user voted??? It has everything. IT HAS DISCO PRINCE (the katamari's content is a ball of fun, too). It even has a bunny. Am I biased? Maybe. But the art style is amazing and this is the true winner in my heart.

Absolutely stellar job.
