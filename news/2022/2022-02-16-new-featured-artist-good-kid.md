While rhythm games tend to focus on complicated electronic songs, we're changing the script today. **Good Kid** is a 5-man indie rock band known for a collection of high-tempo tunes and an iconic visual style highlighted by their character "Nomu Kid".

**10** tracks from their full discography are here to stay. Check them out from [**Good Kid**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/240), then pick your favourite to begin your inevitable mapping journey.

**Good Kid** might not be a household name on osu! yet, but they're bound to be soon. To get your mapping juices flowing, watch [-Noel-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9805331) play through [Good Kid - Alchemist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1689430) using the new "Alternate" mod, then sample a few more songs below:
