Growing talent **LandRoot** firmly plants himself in our Featured Artist library!

A relatively new addition to the musicscape, Korean creator **LandRoot** is an artist with humble origins. He began his production journey by working on his friends' video game soundtracks, eventually improving enough to design songs for rhythm game music contests like *BMS OF FIGHTERS*.

**LandRoot**'s journey on osu! is only just beginning. Pick out your favourite from any of the **10** songs on [**LandRoot**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/327)!

osu! first laid ears on **LandRoot** through *Need To De-stress*, a tune that's entered the Ranked section via both [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1834399) and [osu!taiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1474263) beatmaps. See for yourself how those panned out and explore the rest of what's up for grabs:

If you haven't already, you should cancel all of your future plans and dedicate the remainder of your life to mapping something from [**LandRoot**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/327). If that's too hardcore for you, just remember that the songs are available as pre-timed beatmap templates.

If you watched [The Roundtable](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-07-08-the-roundtable) last summer, you saw the logo for our next Featured Artist and you don't even know it. Stay tuned to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) to figure out who's next on the roster.
