It's that time of the month again! Project Loved returns with a fresh dose of maps to vote on!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)

To those who're still unfamiliar with what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the Loved Captains of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the Project Loved forum [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! You can read more about this project on the [wiki page](/wiki/Project_Loved).

As always, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the March votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

This month, a person who's known for hosting one of the best community tournament series, the [Global Taiko Showdown](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS), has joined us as a part of the team. Please welcome our newest addition, [Kasumi-sama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263)! He will be joining us as a captain for osu!... catch??

Yes, you heard that right, Kasumi's wrath also extends to the fruit sector as a high-ranked player, and he'll be joining the osu!catch captains to serve you all the *fruitiest* maps out there!

We'd also like to take a moment to thank [Penguinosity](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10235296) for his continuous contribution towards the osu!mania Loved scene for more than a year, as he has decided to retire from his duties as a captain. We wish you the best in your future endeavors!

Without any further ado, let's move onto this month's picks!

Racking up over a thousand favorites at the time of writing this, Renamon's simple yet engaging map of *Mate Um Bonito Hoje Mesmo!* has won the hearts of many cursor-flinging jump map enthusiasts over its nearly 3 years of life. Coupled with a short, catchy song and a fair few difficulties, it's no wonder this map blew up as much as it did in recent times.

Check it out if you've been feeling the intense desire of perfectly smashing those circles all over your screen on the highest difficulty at 7 stars, or would like an easier yet still challenging time on either of the two lower difficulties.

200 BPM, 3:08 | 7.39★\
*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

Within the last year, Seamob maps have garnered massive popularity for their addictive stamina based flow aim and the high spacing within them. Bad for me is another great example of this, and similarly to Lullaby, it leans into this player fantasy heavily.

At 200 BPM, and a hefty 7.4 star rating, the three minute runtime is nothing short of brutal. Whether your confidence to perform is high or not, this map will certainty pose a challenge, and maybe leave your arm sore in the meantime.

If all of this piques your interest, I recommend you vote yes and help this map enter the loved category!

fanzhen0019 is well-renowned for having some of the most unique and carefree maps in the game, and this map showcases that like no other. Don't be fooled by the low star rating, and the approach rate of 6 is only the first of many reasons why.

The map itself features deceptively spaced patterns that make you question your ability to read osu! maps at all.

Whether you're looking for a map to challenge your reading or just feel like twisting your brain for whatever reason, this is the map to go to.

*description written by [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983)*

When it comes to the art of mapping high-speed, jump-heavy breakcore, Silverboxer is a name that always springs to mind. Many of his early mapsets became very popular through multiplayer lobbies and tournament warmup picks, and this is no exception!

Mapped in 2016, Some of the references in *PISSCORD* might be a little dated, but this mapping certainly hasn't aged a day. 250 BPM jumps are the name of the game, with no respite for its 1 minute 30 second length. Geometric shapes, back and forths, and linear patterns abound in this one, but it still retains a smooth flow that stops it from feeling like an old map. It also comes loaded with a full spread of difficulties, including many from some renowned guest mappers, peaking at over 7 stars in difficulty.

A great example of the aim-heavy mapping of the mid 2010's, with the following to match. Let us know if you think it should ascend into the Loved category!

*description written by [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983)*

A huge, high quality set that was uploaded on Christmas Day of 2015 by Gero, a venerable crew of decorated mappers contributed some great difficulties to this set for *Rainbow Tylenol*. There are also full sets for osu!taiko and osu!catch here, but only the osu!standard maps will be up for this nomination. Let us know if you'd like to see those taiko and catch sets up for voting in future months!

This set is mostly mapped in a linear flow aim style at 135 BPM, and covers a very wide range of difficulty. As you progress through each map, the linear patterns become more technical and spaced. However, if you can conquer pishifat's jumpy Extra difficulty, there is a 7.8 star dreadnought of a map designed by Mismagius. The brutal linear aim patterns that it has are not for the faint of heart.

To top it all off, a colourful storyboard by the maestro Exile-, creator of the mapset for [world.execute(me);](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/470977#osu/1006822), adds the finishing touch. It's a spectacular visual treat.

This is a polished set that with the exception of a lack of hitsounding on Nogard's Extra, would be right at home in the ranked section. Sadly, the set had been left abandoned for many years, which is a tragedy. Now is the time to see if we can give this set a home in Project Loved!

OWC#1 was plagued with myriad problems - not least of which was a lack of challenging maps for the best players of the day. Typically, tournaments let players select which map to play from a pool, however the grand finals of OWC#1 had only 9 maps that would be played in sequence, back to back. Only 8 of them were submitted; this was the 9th.

A team of some of the best mappers the game had to offer came together to create **the very first custom map for a tournament**. Meant to be a sightread test to the players, it was only released after the match's conclusion and only for a brief period of time; soon deleted, lost to history for years, until m980 found a backup from before his original upload.

It is far past time for this map to be granted a leaderboard. 11 years, almost to the day, after [its original upload](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/45412?n=824), this collab is more than deserving of a special-case entry into the Loved section, not least because of the incredible historical significance it holds. For reference, the next fully custom map used in OWC would not appear way until *2019*.

The subject itself has braved the test of time outstandingly - many lovable and memorable themes from Castlevania are the plaything of the mappers, who worked to produce a masterpiece of a map that still holds up both visually and gameplay-wise. The challenge to many will come from its low approach rate, typical of the period, the map itself being comfortably accessible to many today thanks to the vast advancement in player skill since it was originally played.

Take a trip through history; give this map a play or two in honour of the legendary players and mappers of the past (and also simply because the map is a massive amount of fun)!

Seen as *[the lost dedicated](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/194923)* on steroids, this map has been the "osu! human benchmark" for many of the best players in the world. The map is one minute long and jam-packed with the most intricate and non-stop aim patterns in the game, putting your mechanics to the test like no other. If you've ever wanted a map that's all of the action and none of the fluff, as well as a map that you can keep coming back to no matter how much you improve at the game, look no further than this (literal) masterpiece.

When you think of taiko marathons, it will most likely be a \~20-40 minute distorted j-pop compilation filled with amen breaks but *Because Maybe!* is different. *Because Maybe!* is an album by Renard, a fairly well-known artist in the osu! community, filled with a whopping 20 tracks. Well guess what, [Axer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7299864) and his mapping colleagues mapped all of them! Not only does this mapset include a 60-minute collab marathon featuring every song on the album, it also includes all 20 songs as separate diffs so you don't have to play the first 53 minutes only to play *TU4AR* ;).

If you thought it couldn't get any better: this map also features an amazing storyboard by [Jerry](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/605973), so make sure you play with the storyboard enabled for the full experience! Let's see who's ready for [Axer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7299864) and his friends to take you for a 60-minute ride.

*Kotori - Nanamori (youth remix)* is a very popular track among osu! players, and both Felt7z & nyanmi's excellent taiko redemption of it works for an spectacular combo. Sporting two diffs just asenergetic as the track itself, it's no surprise both have been featured in several tournaments throughout their lifetimes, amassing enough popularity to make not nominating this for Loved a crime.

With streams, engaging rhythms, patterning and two different approaches for a hyper track such as this one, we at Loved HQ are glad to bring this mapset, which you should absolutely try if you haven't done so yet!

It's always refreshing to see what applerss has to offer in his maps, as often times it means it will be full of comfortable patterns one after another and this isn't the exception.

*dev - lovely freezing tomboy bath* is quite contrasting to its name as this map is literal fire, with 300 BPM streams and a considerable density overall that would sound crazy difficult if it wasn't for how applerss made it with carefully placed streams that link pretty well to the next making for a very flowy experience, meaning this'll sure be a nice treat for the BPM mashers in our community!

Coincidentally enough, *Kurokotei - Serphut* was probably one of our Featured Artist first delves into the footcore genre, just as its mapper, Nifty, first tried mapping tech and he sure made quite a enjoyable one at that.

While at first it may seem as your usual 170ish BPM map, the kiai is full with 1/6 and 1/8 bursts between streams that could make several experienced players trip on some them, just as it happened during the osu!taiko World Cup 2021 Semifinals as this was a Hard Rock pick and saw a lot of drops there.

Are you up to the challenge?

*description written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

If we were to consider just how experienced of a mapper Firce777 is, as one of those who were on the scene since the beginning of times, it is such a shame that we've taken so long to put another of his creations up for voting, so we settled in for this one.

*Camellia - \\\* Erm, could it be a Spatiotemporal ShockWAVE Syndrome...?* is quite an interesting gimmick map, as it explores the idea of "stops" in osu!taiko, a concept the community has wanted as a feature for so long, making it quite innovating compared to what we often see (even though it's somewhat common on other taiko emulators). This also really makes one wonder how the SV meta could have developed if it was a thing from the beginning.

Anyways, while it may be infuriating at first due to how sudden those stops are, once you get the hang of it, it becomes very rewarding to play this map so make sure to try it out!

Some may be unfamiliar with ler1211, but this trending mapper has been producing beatmaps that attract many players with their spick-and-span charting style. His enthusiastic activity in the mapping community successfully got him his first ranked beatmap only a few months after he began mapping.

*Slax - Loli Bomb* by ler1211 shows his excellent sense of chart placement. It consists of 6 diffs composed of five speed-up versions and one original diff. Its charting structure has been praised by many speed players, and now it has made its way into the Loved votings. There are surely many speed maps you've enjoyed before, but this one will no doubt be the most remarkable one for you!

DukeDukeDura is a name many people in the Taiko community will recognise due to an extensive backlog filled with high-quality maps (with many of them appearing in tournaments). However, DukeDukeDura is undoubtably most well known for their Igorrr maps.

*Igorrr - Robert* offers a nice middle ground in terms of difficulty compared to *DukeDukeDura's* other Igorrr maps like [Half a Pony](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/447397) or [Cicadidae](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/821722), although that is not to say that *Robert* is easy, because the map is filled with atypical and constantly changing rhythms as well as very difficult patterns.

For those who want to play this very unique song but find the higher-density snappings of the top difficulty too hard, DukeDukeDura has also included the Amiable difficulty, but this difficulty is also not a walk in the park as it still consists of constant rhythm changes too!

*Hyper Bass feat. Yunomi (7_7 bootleg)* is a map made by EJ_\_ and remixed by 7_7, who is also a taiko player. This map was used as the NM1 in the Round of 16 of [TWC 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2021).

There are a moderate number of shorter streams and 1/6 and 1/8 bursts placed in this map, but they are all easy patterns, and all of them are very good practice for the basics.

All in all, it's a very good map for those who want to hone their taiko skills and test their abilities. Why not play and see what kind of map it is? We hope you will like it!

It is once again time to dive into the past to explore a very old map, dating all the way back to the year 2011. *Stardust Lullaby* is a map not too many people will know nowadays, but was very popular back in the day. Today we have maps such as [Satori De Pon!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/365254) that are considered "survival maps", but back in the day this was THE survival map.

Since this map was made back in 2011, it was made with the old hyperdash system in mind. Obviously this beatmap will not be the same as when you played it years ago in a multiplayer lobby or during solo play (if you were even playing back then), but it is still a very cool map and a fun throwback to an older style of mapping.

Dika312 makes his return to the Loved section with quite the unique map that went quite under the radar until today!

With his map of *Unwelcome School*, Dika312 experiments with patterns that don't require you to dash, despite there being dashes, also known as hyperwalks.

The take Dika312 has on these patterns makes it a completely different story than what we're used to, though. They're generally known as pretty speed-based patterns, with them generally being made using stacks, but Dika flipped that idea around its head and made the map with sliders... to make for one challenging map which tests your control and accuracy.

And it is absolutely relentless.

I bet many of you have been waiting for this and it is finally here up for voting: last year's [osu!catch World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2021) Grand Finals tiebreaker *of Ambrosia!*

Oh boy, where do I even start on this? First of all, the song itself was a commission and it was specifically composed for the osu!catch World Cup. It was first revealed to the public during the mappool showcase along with the map. As the difficulty name suggests, it is a collab, but one of the strongest collabs imagineable on top of that. Jemzuu, Ascendance, Deif and Spectator — there is hardly anyone out there who wouldn't know those names. Just seeing who was involved making this should give you an idea what you are in for.

As for the map itself — I mean it IS a Grand Finals tiebreaker, so it is not going to be easy to play for anyone out there. To be able to play this map on a high level, or let alone pass it, you need to be well versed in lots of different skillsets that the game mode has to offer. On top of that, with it being a six-minute long map not offering you any downtime, you need a good amount of stamina as well. All in all, a very tough map, and if you are up for a challenge, make sure to give it a try!

Thank the gods, there is at least one "conventional" map to be found in this round of catch Loved picks for the people who might not be so quirky, or a top 50 player.

In this "mazarean" party of sorts, you get to enjoy the likes of five different mappers spread across varying difficulties, in a set that is very well polished and still feels quite similar to maps in the current era. Thanks to this, mods can very well be applied on all of these difficulties — the Rain difficulty of this map was even used in the [CWC 4 years ago](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2018) as a Hard Rock pick!

So feel yourself welcome to join the party! You can stay at home for this one, from your gamer chair, no excessive drinking required (that is, if you vote **yes** of course!).

eZmmR's returns to the Loved voting with his set of *Mopemope*!

Fair warning: this set isn't for the faint of heart. There are definitely some gimmicks that will catch you off guard if this is your first time playing any difficulty in this set. However, the chaotic nature of this set works very well with the song, and you will definitely feel engaged while playing.

For both the -"cute.-. and the -"evil.-. difficulties, be prepared for SV gimmicks with memorization sections thrown in here and there. For the -"Suic!de.-. difficulty, brace yourself for one of the most jarring experiences you may ever have playing this game. There aren't really any words to describe this other than how creative the storyboarding is as well as how cruel some of the tricks are.

This set has continually gained traction over the past two years, and it's finally time to give this set a chance to be in the Loved category. Make sure to cast your vote!

Evening is here once again, with their ruthless and iconic set of Camellia's *Bring Our Ignition Back*!

Through and through, this set to me represents Evening's unapologetic style of harsh SV mixed with rigid patterning. This mapset contains both 4K and 7K, the latter of which being made by none other than [eyes]( https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7741797). All of the difficulties also contain mirrors without SV for anybody wanting to play the stripped-back versions, but I'll be focusing on the ones that do include it.

The SV stays consistent throughout all of the vip diffs, which means once you've got the SV down on one difficulty, learning how to play the others is just going to come down to remembering the differences in patterning. Pattern-wise, lot of parallels can be drawn between the 4K and 7K diffs, as both *suppressions* are very jack- and burst-oriented. This leads to a strong feeling of cohesion between everything, and it's no surprise why this has been played for many years at this point. Tough patterning in unison with Evening's always-engaging SV structuring makes this a well-deserved and long overdue nomination to Loved.

Show your support to both Evening and eyes by giving your vote!

inteliser makes their return to the Loved polls, with their revered jack map of Hikaru Utada's *traveling*!

Over the past few years since inteliser created this map, it's consistently been cited as one of the more creative chordjack maps the playerbase has seen. With it's unapologetic use of anchors, a plethora of quads, and not a single break in sight during the song's 5-minute runtime.

It's no wonder how this gained the reputation that it has for being not only unique, but VERY difficult. Chordjack is one of the most difficult skillsets to make stand out, and the fact that this chart years after creation is still known to be incredibly distinct is really just a testament to Intel's creativity as a charter.

We're happy to finally bring this one to all of you, and make sure to show inteliser your support by giving your vote.

Do you like SDVX? Do you like *trills*? Let's see what you can do on the HEAVENLY difficulty of Aruel's *A Lasting Promise*!

Aruel, formerly known as Fresh Chicken, is a name that everyone knows too well from the ranking section. With a staggering total of 27 contributions to the ranked section dating back to as early as 2015, Aruel has amassed millions upon millions of plays across all of their mapsets. Any player who has touched the game for a non-negligible amount of time would have encountered one of their maps, as they regularly contribute full spreads to many other iconic songs from SDVX.

*A Lasting Promise* is one such song that did not make the ranked section, and would be rather difficult to push nowadays without revising the map's identity in a substantial way. It has nevertheless amassed an incredible amount of plays and favorites, going by graveyard metrics. This is why we are pushing this today, as Aruel's very first Loved entry, in a way to capture and engrave this map's identity! *Can you believe there has been no Loved Fresh Chicken before?*

The mapset itself is a full spread of Laur's frantic 270 BPM speedcore onslaught, giving anyone a chance to enjoy it in their own ways. Ranging from 1.3 to 6.4 stars in terms of density, you will most certainly be able to pick which difficulty you're most comfortable with.

Don't be too disappointed by the lack of pp from the Loved section (no one needs pp anyway, fix your dopamine addiction). Let's see those votes and feedback.

We're taking things far back, with akuma123's set of *3rd Eye In Breast*.

Uploaded back in the beginning of 2015, this set is well over 7 years old now. Since then the community has grown exponentially, and really everything about this gamemode as well as the whole game has changed completely. If there's one thing that has stayed consistent however, it's that sets were always favored, and as far as I can remember this particular set took off pretty quickly.

For 4K players at the time, things like the 4K SHD or even the INF would have provided some serious challenge. 208 BPM jumpstreams are still fast even for today's standards, especially if you're a newer player. Not to mention that this set also includes a 7K difficulty from [Skalim]( https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2225008), a long-time veteran of the game. This 7K is really no slouch on the density end either, containing all kinds of uncomfortable jumps and bursts. Lastly, there are also the lower difficulties which should make this more appealing to a wider audience of players. It seems like at one point the set was going for Ranked, but hey, things don't always work out on that end.

We're always happy to throw it back with classic sets like these, and give players who weren't around during those times an idea of how things used to be.

MyZterioN- makes their return to Loved, with their widely-enjoyed map of *Nacreous Snowmelt*.

Back in August of last year, MyZ had their map of [MEGALOVANIA]( https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1038667#mania/2171185) go up, and *Snowmelt* here is going up for very similar reasons. Both charts are executed strongly, with MyZ's sensible patterning. There's plenty of challenge to be found in this chart, but at the same time it all feels very ergonomic and rewarding to play.

At OD 7, *Snowmelt* strikes a balance between leaning towards rice, and putting your long note accuracy to the test in many of its tougher sections. Because of that balance, I think it's fair to label this overall as a hybrid. Lots of LN coordination intermixed with rice, dedicated speed and jack sections, and even some LN density in the second half. This chart really feels like the full experience that you would want out of a song as dynamic as this, and MyZterioN- did a great job of making that happen.

Give your vote to show them your appreciation!

*Paintings? Oh, yeah.*

The tournament scene needs absolutely no introduction to juankristal: arguably the most notorious contributor and one of the most prolific mappers as far as long notes go. Human hands are not enough to count the amount of qualifiers this man has provided. Who do you have to blame for the current state of the LN meta? Yes, Blame Juan.

*Paintings? Oh, yeah.*

*Paintings? Oh, yeah.* is one of his mid-tier entries as far as difficulty goes and was mapped all the way back in 2016 for... a French tournament (M4F). It has since been featured in many, many tournaments: some very notable ones ([SOFT 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/546286), [4DMWC2](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/2), [MWC 4K 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2021_4K)), as well as many more discrete ones.

*Paintings? Oh, yeah.*

As a tournament pick, it has mainly been useful as a consistency pick: the coordination and control required to maintain combo and good accuracy throughout the entire 3 minutes and 14 seconds of the song is a fair challenge and separates the players who know their LNs well from the ones who do not.

*Paintings? Oh, yeah.*

Among Juan's collection of Loved maps, this would constitute his 6th entry, and would certainly be one of his more affordable entries along with [Saigo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/609463). Are you willing to *Blame Juan* once again? Give us your votes! Also, just one more thing.

The playcount here is overwhelming for a graveyarded set. Unlike [previous](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1211012) [sets](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1178390) of this song gone up to Loved, this set aims to be very approachable especially since it has both 4K and 7K diffs.

It's been a little while since we've seen Pikobaka in the Loved section, but they're back with another great O2Jam-styled map. This time it's *Runway Drive*!

Like many of Pikobaka's maps, *Runway Drive* features a healthy mix of different LN patterns to keep you on your toes. Whether it's light or dense streams, or the occasional mini-shield, the map provides a fun and engaging playing experience for anyone who wants to give it a shot. The higher star rating may seem intimidating, but the straightforward streams and low OD make the map very approachable for the its difficulty.
