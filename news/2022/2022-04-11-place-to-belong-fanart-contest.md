Somewhere in the world right now, it is spring.

In years gone by, this likely would have been our theme for the first fanart contest of the year, but a certain showing from the osu! community in what is probably the most popular shared canvas on the internet has given us *inspiration*. Inspiration to see the fruits of *your* inspiration.

So, to kick this year's fanart contests off with something new and fresh, we present this theme to you:

**Draw AT LEAST TWO of the official or community osu! mascots experiencing something or somewhere new together.**

You will note that this one is *very* broad. That could be anything or anywhere — and you're exactly right. The only important thing is that there are at least two mascots present and that whatever they're doing or wherever they are at, they are there together.

As always, here's a few suggestions to get the juices flowing:

- Two mascots competing at arcade games
- A sightseeing or touring trip
- Our mascots gazing up lovingly at the visage of the Dean "peppy" Herbert
- Mascots engaged in careful deliberations and strategy planning around a pixelated map
- Any obvious reference to /r/place (there, we said it)
- Anything celebrating the osu! community in all of its wonderful weirdness
- ...basically anything involving togetherness, finding a place to belong, or just doing things together!

The entries will be open for **14 days** from the date of this post, so if you've got something in mind you'd like to make, go get cracking and make it happen... BUT ONLY AFTER YOU'VE READ THE RULES BELOW FIRST. Bad things will happen if you don't, like your hard work being disqualified and never reaching the voting. Don't end up a statistic!

Here's the contest rules:

## Rules

- **By submitting your artwork to this contest, you grant us permission to use your artwork in the main menu client should it win, and to use it in promotional material for both the game (osu!) and the contest (A Place To Belong Fanart Contest).** You retain all rights to your creation and you can sell it and distribute it however you like — it is your work, after all. We're just saying here that if you submit your piece to this contest, you should be okay with us using it.
- **All entries MUST follow the contest theme (a place to belong/togetherness/shared experiences) and contain AT LEAST TWO osu! official or community mascots.** This theme is really broad, but try your best to stick to it, and make sure you include at least two mascots in your end piece.
- **All entries MUST be suitable for all-ages viewing.** We're all about the community warm-fuzzy feel-good, not the other kind. Don't make it weird with risqué stuff.
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK. REDRAWING AND COMPOSITE WORKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** Plagiarism sucks. Don't do it. Someone in the comments will call you out for it as has happened every other time someone's tried and they're going to do more damage to your reputation than us removing your entry from the voting will do. Use only your own work — brushes and the like are fine, but that's it! Don't redraw someone else's work.
- **ARTIST ATTRIBUTION (names, social media handles, etc) MUST BE LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THREE LINES TOTAL AND CONFINED TO EITHER THE BOTTOM LEFT OR BOTTOM RIGHT CORNERS OF YOUR ENTRY.** Being proud of your work is good, just do it in a reasonably small spot of your work. Please understand that we're not very fond of anything ad-related in osu!, and attribution that is blaring enough can be considered as one.
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece — namely 2732x1536. THIS IS CHECKED BY A SCRIPT AND ENTRIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE DISCARDED AUTOMATICALLY.** This is the #1 reason for entries not making it to voting phase. MAKE SURE YOUR ENTRY MEETS THE EXACT RESOLUTION REQUIREMENTS ABOVE. Check your work after you've exported it and BEFORE you submit it.
- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed on the main menu and during the voting process.** Anything you draw that is inside the dotted circle won't be seen during voting phase, because we super-impose an osu! cookie over all entries during voting phase to simulate what they're going to look like on the main menu. Please accommodate for this in your drawing!
- **DO NOT LEAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR SUBMISSION!**
- ***DO NOT LEAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR SUBMISSION!***
- **DO NOT LEAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR SUBMISSION!**
- **Don't use copyrighted characters from other intellectual properties.** All the official osu! mascots and the community mascots are fair game, but please avoid using representations of characters from other worlds or franchises in your work. Remember also that the community mascots are someone else's treasured creation, so please treat them with the same respect that you'd treat your own OCs and work.

Once you've read through those rules and have created your masterpiece-in-waiting, head on over to the [A Place To Belong Fanart Contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/142) and drag your creation over the big fat plus sign to submit your entry any time within the next **14 days**. If you need to update or change something, you can upload again the same way at any time while the contest is open.

A selection of the most voted entries will make it into osu! as main menu backgrounds as the Spring 2022 Seasonal picks, and net their artists a tidy **3 months of osu!supporter** for their efforts. The top 3 will also receive a fancy profile badge cut from their own winning piece!

We look forward to seeing what you come up with — and remember, TWO mascots minimum this time, not just one!
