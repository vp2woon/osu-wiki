The weekly newsletter returns in a monthly format — find out about happenings around the community!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/osu-monthly-1.jpg)

5 years ago, [the osu!weekly](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-06-07-osu-weekly-106) was the community's one stop shop for all the details on what was going on in the wide world of osu!. Today, we're giving this concept of a regular newsletter another go with the birth of the **osu!monthly**.

We'll be keeping things simple at first until we can establish a proper foundation through your feedback and suggestions, so if you have any ideas for articles or other content we could feature, please let us know via the [discussion thread on the forums](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1614314) or get involved in the process over on the [osu!dev Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ppy).

With all this out of the way, let's dive straight into the news!

## What's new in osu!?

This is what went down in the various game modes during July:

#### The Roundtable

If you ask us what the premiere event of July was, it'd definitely be the [Roundtable](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-07-08-the-roundtable)!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-08-01-osumonthly-1/roundtable/RTable_title.png)

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-08-01-osumonthly-1/roundtable/RTable_players.jpg)

Featuring a line-up of great players like global rank #1 player [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902), [Utami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7512553), [RyuK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6304246) and many others, this tournament was truly a congregation of titans, a genius roster that makes sense for this first-ever **IRL osu! invitational**!

Commentary for the entire event, along with gimmicks and constant focus on competitive spirit, was provided by [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691) and everybody's beloved (but slightly bewildered) uncle [Happystick](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/256802), and the result was nothing but epic!

The tournament's epic progression eventually culminated in a final match of **mrekk vs. Utami**. Despite mrekk's defeat against Utami, his performance was nothing short of impressive, demonstrating that his first rank on the leaderboard sits unwavered.

[Highlights for this match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7LqBZL) were made available on BTMC's [YouTube channel](https://twitch.tv/btmc), plus  exclusive interviews of a few participants by BTMC (what a surprise), [Kroytz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2339768) and Happystick.

If you weren't able to follow the event, no worries! The official [Roundtable YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6fSQd4oKBPxkBR93GucCUg/featured) has the full VODs.

With such a promising performance from everyone involved (from caster to players alike), we'll be excitedly looking forward to the next major IRL osu! invitational to continue the trend, and we bet you will be too.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Roundtable will return.<br>Thank you, everyone ❤️</p>&mdash; BTMC (@btmclive) <a href="https://twitter.com/btmclive/status/1546335465518682112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 11, 2022</a></blockquote>

[**See the event announcement post here!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-07-08-the-roundtable)

Thanks again to BTMC and his staff for this insane event!

#### EGTS 2022

Not content to allow osu! to vacuum up all the glory, the members of the osu!taiko community took it upon themselves to create a serious contender of their own with the annual running of the **[Expert Global Taiko Showdown 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2022)**!

Showcasing some of the best drum bashers the community has to offer, EGTS has a storied history of being one of the most competitively and visually impressive contests around, sporting enough dons and kats to even make the Taikonator blush.

The GTS team's insanely talented designer [OsuMe65](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/852867), has also made a trailer for the tournament. Check it out and leave your thoughts down below!

#### osu!catch World Cup 2022 concludes

At the beginning of July, [osu!catch World Cup 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2022), the eleventh iteration of the series, concluded.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-08-01-osumonthly-1/podium.png)

For the fourth time in a row and a total of eight wins, South Korea is the osu!catch champion. The roster consisted of [JISAN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3657951), [Rells](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7937519), [YesMyDarknesss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4158549), [x_angelkawaii_x](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276), [DreStar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1808057), and [Byeol](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2754651). United States ([Secre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2306637), [Lexii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7226149), [Dahcreeper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6926006), [Zak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375955), [Colin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5502521), [Elux](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12004983)) and China ([Dusk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533210), [Callionet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3072921), [Coevir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171965), [Crystal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1646397), [KagamineRin02](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/518503), [Kitakami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6347308)) took second and third place respectively.

It is no secret that players from South Korea are so good that they could swap with each other and win the entire tournament no matter what they were faced up against. With [qwhj1027](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7547506) and [Abstract-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3097304) not being in the South Korean team like the previous year, some analysts had doubts on whether they could claim victory this year again. Thankfully or not, that wasn't the case here at all. With only 11 maps lost throughout entire tournament, South Korea showed that even without the strongest players this game could produce, there were still plenty of players waiting in the wings to take their shot at impressing the community and the crowd with their skills.

The United States entered this tournament with almost the same roster as previous years with swapping [Kisetsunotori](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3692648) to [Elux](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12004983). Although they fell to the losers' bracket after a match against South Korea, the United States showed their determination to prove their worth and claimed themselves as grand finalists for the second time in this World Cup.

With the recent change of swapping from a Group Stage to a Qualifier format, most players and viewers didn't expect to see China on the podium courtesy of a previous performance placing 7–8th. Shattering all expectations, China surged undeterred towards glory by reaching the Winners' Finals bracket without losing a single match until clashing with South Korea and, ultimately, the United States. Even with a long year of absence, China showed that even after being absent for an entire year they can still put up a fearsome fight against top teams.

Plenty of tournaments are running all across the community even after the conclusion of the osu!catch World Cup and the various "digit" tournaments (such as [4 Digit Catch World Cup 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/4CWC/2022) and [3 Digit Catch World Cup 2022](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1580097)), with other regional tournaments like [Catch French Dual Cup 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1605746) entering the registration phase.

Keep your eyes peeled for next month's issue, as this section is sure to swell once we start entering the closing months of the year and tournaments ramp up into full gear.

#### osu!mania 4K World Cup begins

In August, the osu!mania top players will brawl in the osu!mania 4K World Cup 2022!

As it is starting the on **6th of August**, we can't actually talk about it more, but we are excited to say that the next osu!monthly is going to have a **big article** about it, and maybe an **interview of the winner**!

[**Read more about it here!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-07-07-osu-mania-4k-world-cup-2022-registrations-now-open)

## Top scores of the month

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/osu.png) osu!

#### Yomi Yori Madness

[\[Karcher\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11443437) is an absolute madman, achieving an insane full combo on [Yomi yori Kikoyu, Koukoku no Tou to Honoo no Shoujo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/461744#fruits/1031991) that is the first to ever hit the previously unconquered beatmap. For just over 8 minutes of gameplay at a staggering 220 BPM it is no small feat, and thus is more than worthy to be showed off as osu!'s top score of the month.

Not merely content with doing this once, \[Karcher\] opted to go ahead and do it *twice* after a minor mishap with his recording setup the first time potentially might've denied him the opportunity to reap a massive community-set bounty for the score. What more is to say other than *holy crap*?

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/taiko.png) osu!taiko

#### Speed of the gods

Whew! If you thought the pick for osu! was crazy, wait 'till you watch [shinchikuhome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3174184)'s DT play on [Apollo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1739877#taiko/3558252)!

This taiko play is set at an average of 411 BPM. Yes, you read that right, **411 BPM**! This is truly an insane play for any speed enthusiast and absolute taiko enjoyer. Make sure to show some love and enjoy the absolute speed demon plays shinichikuhome is known for!

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/mania.png) osu!mania

#### Superstars strike

The mania k-pop community is going to be absolutely ecstatic at this next showcase.

With [Onta_Bekasi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8677684) not just clearing but FCing the deceptively difficult yet soothing myriad of LNs and intricate patterns that [My Man](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/514681#mania/1093212) so elegantly puts on display, the decision as to what to pick for July's monthly score was all but made for us.

Enduring only a tiny 0.02% accuracy drop across a 3-minute long slog of over 5000 notes, Onta_Bekasi's showing is top tier stuff, and we think you'll understand why after seeing it for yourself below.

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://youtube.com/embed/1RuyJ3y_ot4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### Millions of long notes

Witness this shocking performance by [[GS]Myuka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733) on [Camellia's *MI11I0N PP*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1388481#mania/2867552)!

If you thought the deluge of long notes in *My Man* was something, just wait until you see this 7 minute map of non-stop madness, featuring not only single-note rainbows and glissandos, but an interconnected web of the two. It is an impeccable display of skill, accuracy, speed, and just what osu!monthly is looking for in a showcase!

### ![](/wiki/shared/mode/catch.png) osu!catch

#### Galaxy brain

Somebody screeeeeam! Showing the fearsome prowess behind the number one osu!catch player in the world, [YesMyDarkness](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4158549/fruits) has done it again.

Coming in with an HD HR 4-miss on [Kurokotei's *Galaxy Collapse*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/521900#fruits/1108507), a titanic set renowned for being hard enough on its own without the inclusion of Hidden and HardRock, YesMyDarkness turned the intense and *dash*ingly hard jumps into a spectacle of grand proportions.

## New features in osu!(lazer)

Before this month, notes on osu!(lazer)'s steady development has mostly been relegated to those following along via the [changelog](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ppy/osu) and the occasional tweet from [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) himself on especially interesting features.

With the project rapidly approaching the point where it might earnestly start replacing the old client for a lot of people, there's never been a better time to dip your toes into the future of osu! and see what all the hype is about.

For the first time ever, osu!(lazer) patch notes have been posted on the official osu! [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/osugame) in video form, compiled by [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) with further insight and commentary provided by peppy.

Check out the first of the July update videos below:

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67P4LKlAh-0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

One especially interesting thing about osu!(lazer) is just how much easier it is for developers to create new mods with gameplay aspects that have never been seen before, with the new chaotic experience of the Repel mod serving as an excellent example. Finally, a worthy opponent for [badeu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1473890).

    </video>
</div>

Another feature that's maybe not the newest, but one that some of you might have missed or just haven't gotten around to trying yet, is the **skin layout editor**! First implemented in May 2021, this is still very much a work-in-progress feature, however currently you are able to edit the placement of all skin elements that appear during gameplay! Check out the showcase video from the original patch notes below:

## Monthly community quiz

For those who think they have all the answers... here's a riddle from us to you!

*Once upon a time, in the ye' old osu!, someone asked for advice from the ancestors among osu!, the post reads as follows:*

> Is it possible to repeat songs in osu!? I have an in-game video of KH2 with Roxas battling the Twilight Thorn (people who have played Kingdom Hearts 2 will be drooling) and the video is still halfway when the song ends! Or can someone at least tell me about a free, easy to use software which can solve my problem by repeating the song?

This ancient tome is hidden behind a code, the code you seek is everywhere but nowhere at the same time, always in the back of your mind but only breaching the surface at the moment you see it, now... go forth, unveil the secret code, and paste the number in the link, and gain access to this ancient tome!

The first person to answer it correctly will receive a month of osu!supporter, leave your guesses in the comments!

## End word

Big thanks go out to [Nelly](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4741164) for the osu!catch news bulletin, [fajar13k](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7100002) for his contribution to the EGTS part, and to the numerous [osu!wiki](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki) contributors whose reviews helped make this article possible.
