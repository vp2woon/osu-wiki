**Alestorm** sails into our pool of Featured Artists!

Pirates. And metal.

If you're not already convinced, you might be a lost cause.

**Alestorm** is a Scottish band who's been spitting pirate-themed heavy metal shanties since the 2000s. Their sound has been a staple in osu! since practically the beginning of time, dating as far back as 2008 through a collection of beatmaps created by [awp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2650).

Want some of these treasures for yourself? Scrounge up **11** tunes from [**Alestorm**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/304).

In recent time, **Alestorm**'s songs have become iconic in the tournament scene too! [Keelhauled](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1504284) took the spotlight in last year's *Corsace Closed*, and just a few days ago, [Shipwrecked](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1850895#osu/3802256) made its mark in *Corsace Open*. In case you missed it, watch **Alestorm** in last weekend's mappool showcase for yourself:
