That's a lot of songs, we know. And there's even more on [**Rameses B**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/270) waiting for you to begin your mapping journey. Don't keep them waiting.

## Featured Artists in osu!(lazer)

Speaking of awesome new things, we're also experimenting with **Featured Artist playlists** starting TODAY.

Here's the general idea: every month, we host one (or more) playlists using Featured Artist songs and reward participants with *something*. There isn't a strict format to the playlists — the mod choices, the map selection process, and even the prizes may change month by month. If you're wondering what a playlist is, make sure to check out the video above for a quick rundown of how to get involved!

We'll keep things simple for this first iteration. This month's playlists are...

- Open for **1 month**
- Available for **all game modes**
- Highlighting **8 maps** from recent Featured Artists
- Locked into the **Hidden mod** (with *No Fail* and *Mirror* freemod options)

The **highest ranked 3 players** in each playlist will receive one of these Featured Artist–themed profile badges!
