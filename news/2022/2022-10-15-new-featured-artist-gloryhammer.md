Power metal unit **GLORYHAMMER**'s intergalactic journey takes a pit stop in our osu! Featured Artist collection.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/311/header.jpg)

Considering they were founded by the lead vocalist of our very own [Alestorm](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/304), it was only a matter of time before **GLORYHAMMER** infiltrated our Featured Artists.

**GLORYHAMMER** adopts the role of a storyteller, telling a prophetic tale of conflict behind wizards and a high fantasy cosmic war. And it's just as over-the-top as you'd imagine from that description, with the band fully dedicating to the story by performing as specific characters in the narrative.

Grasp the story by mapping any of the **16** tracks on [**GLORYHAMMER**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/311)!

Check it all out through this video showcasing osu!(lazer)'s in-play leaderboards and the rest of these stellar maps:
