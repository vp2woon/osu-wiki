Countless generations of osu! players have yearned for one thing: the capability to squeeze an osu! cookie or mascot in plushie form. Thanks to a collaboration with Makeship, your dreams can now come true, with **THREE** new crowdfunding campaigns!

Yes, it's finally happening.

As you might've guessed from our recent [Twitter teasing](https://twitter.com/osugame/status/1600560233885339649) and [subsequent giveaway](https://twitter.com/osugame/status/1601055681217384453), we've partnered up with [Makeship](https://www.makeship.com/) to bring a selection of some iconic osu! figures into squishable life.

Feast your eyes on these glorious plushies in the form of *the* osu! cookie, pippi herself, and the much loved Taikonator 3000:

Exciting, right? While we don't have a banana for scale, we do have an open bottle of authentic green tea, a headphone amplifier and a DAC instead. Can you guess whose desk this is? We bet you can.

Something in this picture will make you go 'woot', and we suspect it probably isn't the keyboard.

Still not convinced? Witness a pippi plushie riding into the (osu! cookie) sunset atop the Taikonator 3000 as she leaves behind a hard life of farming scores for a new adventure that involves actually enjoying the game. She's crying because she's happy.

Take a moment to look back on how far we've come, from clicking circles and making fan art to actually bringing both of them into the real world. In plushie form, no less.

When our dashing developer [smoogipoo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1040328) isn't carefully considering code commits, he moonlights as a plushie salesman. Instead of punching time cards, our developers try to sell you things that just straight-up punch you instead.

We also felt it was important to demonstrate just how throwable the osu! cookie plushie is. No reason.

If you like what you see, make them yours today by helping us fund the Makeship campaigns to bring them into reality. But get in quick, because these plushies are a **limited-edition** run — so if you don't buy them this time, they're probably not coming back again!

## How does this all work?

It's real simple, and Makeship also [describes the process on their site](https://www.makeship.com/how-it-works):

- If you want any (or all) of the three plushies above, pledge for them on Makeship by **clicking any of the pictures above**.
- There's also a 10% discount if you order two, and 15% discount if you order three!
- Guaranteed campaigns keep taking new orders until they close, so everyone who orders one will get one.

Basically, buy the plushies and if enough people want one, they get made. Easy as that!

**[What're you waiting for? Pledge for your osu!-themed plushies today!](https://www.makeship.com/search?q=ppy)**

Make sure to act quick, since production of these adorable plushies starts on January 1, 2023 — and only for the plushies that meet their funding goal by this date! They're expected to ship out around the end of March 2023, if successful.

You've got the rest of the month to convince your friends and family to help support the effort. There's no risk to you if the goal isn't met, so get in quick to signal your interest and secure your limited-edition plushie(s) while you can!
