A duo of [**Monstercat**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/255) talents have made their homes in our Featured Artists library!

Ultra-talented producers **Nitro Fun** and **Rezonate** offer two distinct takes on EDM.

**Nitro Fun** emphasizes literal *fun* through high tempo and high energy with a style that especially appeals to video game audiences, as seen through feature spots in *Sonic the Hedgehog*, *Forza Horizon*, and *Just Shapes and Beats*. **Rezonate**, however, leans towards the side of pure *relaxation*, producing longer songs at lower tempos that evoke a sense of grandiose exploration.

A combined **6** tracks from both of these artists are ready for mapping! Take your pick from [**Nitro Fun**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/299) or [**Rezonate**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/300).
