The end of the year approaches, and with it, so too does an era in osu!'s history. Grab your drawing implement of choice and look to the future in our latest art contest!

Astute watchers of and participants in our various fanart contests may have noticed a bit of an anomaly: lots of "winter" themed ones around this time of year, but never any focused on the festive occasion that is the new year.

Following on the trends set with the [15th Anniversary Art Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-09-15-anniversary-art-contest-results) and the [A Place To Belong Fanart Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-05-08-aptb-fanart-results), we're going *thematic* with the end-of-year art contest this year, with a **twist**:

**Draw any of the official or community osu! mascots celebrating new beginnings!**

If you're scratching your head and thinking "what the heck is a *new beginning*", never fear, as we've got some tips to help grease your creative gears:

- Any kind of "new year"-themed celebrations
- Looking out on a near distant future
- The mascots enjoying some future candy
- A new years party with many bottles of (responsibly consumed) future cider
- Anything related to the future of osu! (hint: it rhymes with floss tazer)
- ...basically anything involving optimism for the future that you can think of and make the mascots look awesome doing in the process.

We figure a lot of you will go for the new years theme here, and that's perfectly fine! But make sure to give contest's theme a good, long think, since it's a pretty open one. Generally speaking, bright and positive dreaming of the future in a celebratory manner is what we're looking for.

As an extra bonus, you'll have **27 days** from the date of this post to make your entry real.

Yes, that's almost exactly TWO WHOLE WEEKS more than the typical amount of time we open these contests for. We'll even be opening the voting basically on Christmas too, which is something we've never done before. Very exciting!

As always, a selection of the top-voted entries as chosen by the community will be made into our *fancy* new years backgrounds to welcome in 2023. In addition, their authors will receive 3 months of osu! supporter, with the top 3 finalists receiving a profile badge to commemorate their victory.

Got all that? Before you get cracking, make sure to read the rules below:

## Rules

- **By submitting your artwork to this contest, you grant us permission to use your artwork in the main menu client should it win, and to use it in promotional material for both the game (osu!) and the contest (New Beginnings Art Contest).** You retain all rights to your creation and you can sell it and distribute it however you like — it is your work, after all. We're just saying here that if you submit your piece to this contest, you should be okay with us using it.
- **All entries MUST follow the contest theme ("new beginnings") and contain AT LEAST one of the osu! official or community mascots.** Make sure to make the theme of the contest obvious in your entry!
- **All entries MUST be suitable for all-ages viewing.** The future involves appropriately clothed mascots in more or less a PG-13 setting. Some things never change!
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK. REDRAWING AND COMPOSITE WORKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** Plagiarism sucks. Don't do it. Someone in the comments will call you out for it as has happened every other time someone's tried and they're going to do more damage to your reputation than us removing your entry from the voting will do. Use only your own work — brushes and the like are fine, but that's it! Don't redraw someone else's work.
- **AI art generation methods are not allowed.** This includes any kind of software that has you supply a written or visual prompt and fills in large amounts of details for you.
- **Artist attribution (names, social media handles, etc.) must be limited to no more than three lines total and confined to either the bottom left or bottom right corners of your entry.** Being proud of your work is good, just do it in a reasonably small spot of your work. One thing unique to osu!'s history is that we really don't like forced advertisement, and attribution that is too large can come across like it.
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece — namely 2732x1536.** Good news! The contest system now prevents you from submitting entries that don't match this resolution. Welcome to the future!
- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed on the main menu and during the voting process.** Very simply: anything in the big white circle won't be seen during the voting. Don't leave a big white hole in your piece either, please!
- **Do not leave the dotted osu! cookie template visible in your submission.** The future involves not leaving the gosh darned cookie template visible in your piece. We're a civilised world now. Please. I beg you.
- **Don't use copyrighted characters from other intellectual properties.** All the official osu! mascots and the community mascots are fair game, but please avoid using representations of characters from other worlds or franchises in your work. Remember also that the community mascots are someone else's treasured creation, so please treat them with the same respect that you'd treat your own OCs and work.

When you're finished and ready to submit your entry, head on over to the [New Beginnings Art Contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/160) and submit your creation. Remember: you can delete it and re-submit it as many times as you like before the listing ends, so don't worry if you need to make changes!

We're excited to see what people come with and will be *extra* excited if any artists try to take the plunge into realizing some of the first drawn references to osu!(lazer). The future's getting real close, after all.
