We're proud to pull **Hino Isuka** into our ever-growing Featured Artist collection!

Ever since his beginnings in 2013, **Hino Isuka** has aimed to perfect his style of densely packed notes throughout high-tension and high-speed tunes. Considering this is exactly what rhythm games seek out, it's no surprise that **Hino Isuka**'s sound has been adopted by games like *maimai*, *CHUNITHM*, *Arcaea*, *Groove Coaster*, and *Muse Dash*!

**12** of his ultra-dense tracks have made their way to our humble circle clicking game too! Check them all out from [**Hino Isuka**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/272).
