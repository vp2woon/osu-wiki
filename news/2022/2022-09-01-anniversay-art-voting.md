Sporting perhaps one of the trickiest themes we've seen so far, the 15th Anniversary Art Contest has really come out swinging. What better way to match the enthusiasm than to swing back with a vote or ten?

To celebrate people not leaving the dotted osu! cookie template visible in their submissions, it has decided to do a little dance in a new and *fancy* promotional video for the contest linked below, courtesy of one pishifat. Get bopping to some tunes from [**Lundy**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/203), one of our ridiculously talented Featured Artists as you consider it all:

As usual, the voting will stay open for roughly **7 days** from the date of this newspost. Depending on how things go, we'll announce the winners either shortly after the voting concludes, or on osu!'s actual 15th anniversary instead. We haven't quite decided yet, since *things* are afoot.

A selection from the top voted entries will make it to the game's main menu as seasonal backgrounds, and their creators will also receive 3 months of osu!supporter. The top 3 most voted entries will additionally nab themselves profile badges made from their own artworks.

Best of luck to everyone in the running, and to everyone else that has to figure out how to pick only fifteen of them to vote for!
