Desperate for more *Touhou* music? **Innocent Key** has it.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/323/header.jpg)

Back in the early days of osu!, *Touhou* arrangements were among the most mapped songs in the game, with **Innocent Key** standing at the forefront. A solid collection of **Innocent Key** maps reached the Ranked category between 2009 and 2011, earning maps like [Lunatic Red Eyes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/17676) and [Wanna Be My Dream](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/19840) their well-deserved status as classic beatmaps.

*Touhou* arrangements are a cornerstone in osu!, and **14** outstanding tracks by **Innocent Key** are now officially part of the community. Forever. Check them all out from [**Innocent Key**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/323)!

Peeking into the history of mapping can be fun, but let's not forget about the current era. Watch this video comparing maps of the same song from 2010 and 2022, then investigate the rest of these classics:
