**HEAD PHONES PRESIDENT** crashes into the scene as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/238/header.jpg)

An innovator in Japan's alternative heavy rock movement, 4-piece band **HEAD PHONES PRESIDENT** isn't what you'd expect from J-rock. Mixing tribal rhythms with intense melodies and vocalist *ANZA*'s raw emotion, the band's unparalleled style has been center stage at countless live music festivals throughout Japan, and is now front and center here on osu!.

**10** headbangers can be spooled up from [**HEAD PHONES PRESIDENT**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/238), coming from two of their major studio releases *Realize* and *Respawn*.

**HEAD PHONES PRESIDENT** is a fairly new name to the osu! community, so feel free to explore their tunes through this video showcasing osu!(lazer)'s newest *Aim Assist* mod and the rest of these song previews:
