After a decade of releasing remixes under the alias *dj-Jo*, **Zenpaku** launches a new era of original tunes as our newest Featured Artist!

Taking notes from major rhythm game music producers like [Chroma](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/215), [MisoilePunch](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/239), and [Frums](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/68), **Zenpaku**'s emerging style aims to scratch an itch for rhythm game communities along with fans of both electronic music and unorthodox concept albums.

Speaking of albums, **Zenpaku** joins our Featured Artist catalogue today while simultaneously releasing his newest mini-album *Odyssey Cycle* (which is available for mapping, of course). Take a look at the full **7** song list over on [**Zenpaku**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/316)!
