There's only one word to describe the sensation of knowing **Ata**, our latest Featured Artist: euphoria.

Esteemed scholars of the osu! multiverse will pick this clever reference out immediately and recall the yesteryear of 2019, where life was simple until [one fabled beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/890438) by [Ciyus Miapah](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2805457) (also known as Fort) challenged us to capture **THE KING**, all set to the tunes of... you guessed it, [**Ata**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/309)'s *Euphoria*.

Three years and 1.3 million plays later, nobody is really sure if we've gotten any closer to absconding with aforementioned royalty, but we are absolutely certain about our love for **Ata**'s dark psychedelic sound (you can hear the bespoke **Ata** lead synths from a mile away) and the [considerable](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/614510) [number](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1234186) of [beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1722551) it has spawned, including a variety of graveyard classics such as ["harder euphoria"](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1539945) which quite honestly, speak for themselves.

We've snagged **6** new tracks for you to make into the mapping masterpieces of the future and to continue the great quest started all those years ago.

Take a trip down memory lane, in case you've forgotten:
