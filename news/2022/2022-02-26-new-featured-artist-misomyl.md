**MisomyL** adds osu! to their list of rhythm game appearances as our latest Featured Artist!

One half of the ever-talented duo behind [MisoilePunch](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/239), **MisomyL** has been making appearances in rhythm games left and right. *Cytus II*, *Deemo*, *Taiko no Tatsujin*, and *SOUND VOLTEX* are only a few of the places **MisomyL**'s magic has been featured — and that's not even considering the songs they've produced outside of the rhythm game space.

**7** tracks are up for grabs from [**MisomyL**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/243), including awesome songs like *Catalinésie* and *Amnéhilesie* from major music events like *BMS OF FIGHTERS*.

Nothing could convince you to try mapping these songs more than actually *hearing* them. Take a peek at the various styles behind [MisomyL - Amnéhilesie](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1703921) through this video, then check out some snazzy previews:
