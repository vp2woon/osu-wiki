WELCOME **AAAA** TO OUR FEATURED ARTIST LIBRARY.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/301/header.jpg)

Earning the spotlight in games like *Arcaea*, *maimai*, *CHUNITHM*, *pop'n music*, *SDVX*, *Muse Dash*, and... more than we can reasonably list, **AAAA** is an undeniable legend in the realm of rhythm game compositions.

**22** insanely awesome tracks are ready for mapping from [**AAAA**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/301)!

**AAAA**'s Featured Artist reveal was a bit unorthodox. In collaboration with fellow legends [Hino Isuka](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/272) and [Umeboshi Chazuke](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/98), **AAAA** helped create the custom song [*stεganography*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1846639#mania/3793375) for the MWC 4K 2022 tiebreaker!

If you missed it live, watch how the reveal went in the video below, then check out the massive collection of beatmaps featuring **AAAA** tunes:
