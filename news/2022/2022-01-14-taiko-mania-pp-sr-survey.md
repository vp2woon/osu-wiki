A call to arms for players from the osu!taiko and osu!mania game modes! We want your feedback on the way performance points and star rating development should proceed—read on to get involved!

Six months ago, the osu!team released a [public survey](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2021-08-17-pp-sr-survey) to assess the community's position on both current and future deployments of performance and difficulty calculation. The [results of the survey](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2021-09-02-pp-sr-survey-results) helped us better understand the community's expectations, as well as determine the best path moving forward.

For the reasons above, we are now opening surveys for the **osu!taiko** and **osu!mania** game modes.

The link to the survey will require you to authenticate your osu! profile—please do not change any of the pre-populated fields on the first page of the survey, otherwise your response may not be recorded. **As long as those fields have the proper information in them, you can proceed onwards and start answering questions.**

- [**osu!taiko survey**](https://form-auth.ppy.sh/form/2022-taiko-pp-sr-survey)
- [**osu!mania survey**](https://form-auth.ppy.sh/form/2022-mania-pp-sr-survey)

Each survey should take no more than 10 minutes to complete, so make sure to pass the news along to any of your friends that might be interested! Your opinion is extremely valuable to us.

For those who wish to become more involved, development of osu!'s difficulty systems is centralised on the [osu!dev Discord](https://discord.gg/ppy), with discussions taking place both on [GitHub](https://github.com/ppy/osu-performance) and in the respective `#difficulty` channels for each game mode.

We'll be making the results of this poll visible in **2 weeks' time** so that everybody can get a feel for where their fellow manic drummers stand.
