With a fearsome showing of **134** entries, the artists of the osu! community have been hard at work — so come spend your **14** votes today!

At first, we weren't quite sure if this year's slightly unusual theme would resonate with our creators much. Then the entries started coming in. And kept coming. *And just would not stop.*

Such dedication must be rewarded. And what better way to do it than by slinging one of your **14** votes at your favourite piece of art?

Get a taste of the choices available with this handy 1-minute clip below, set to the tunes of [**Mameyudoufu**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/209), one of our glorious Featured Artists:

The voting will stay open for only **7 days** from the date of this post, so make sure to get in quick or be left watching from the sidelines as all of this wicked art passes you by.

As always, the Spring 2022 Seasonal backgrounds will be a choice selection of the top voted entries, which will range anywhere from 15 to 20 pieces depending on how the voting goes.

Their artists will also snag a neat bit of osu!supporter for their efforts, and the top 3 finalists will receive a profile badge forged from their own work to celebrate the victory with.

Good luck to all participating, be it as an artist, or as an agonised voter with too many amazing choices.
