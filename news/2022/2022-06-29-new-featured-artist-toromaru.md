We've rounded up **12** songs from modern jazz savant **Toromaru** for our Featured Artist library!

If you ever thought rhythm game music wasn't complicated enough, **Toromaru** is here prove otherwise. Drawing inspiration from classic rock and jazz piano, **Toromaru**'s intricate sound has traversed the music world into games like *SOUND VOLTEX*, *pop'n music*, *CHUNITHM*, and (of course) **osu!**.

A dozen of these masterpieces can be found on [**Toromaru**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/279)!

If you need some mapping inspiration, [this beatmap of Formless Canvas](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1727694) demonstrates exactly how **Toromaru**'s elaborate sound translates to circles and sliders. See exactly how a top player follows this dense mapping through this video featuring [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691), then check out everything else:

## Featured Artists playlists

In other news, the first batch of osu!(lazer) [**Featured Artist playlists**](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-05-28-new-featured-artist-rameses-b#featured-artists-in-osu!(lazer)) have concluded! The top 3 players for each game mode have earned themselves a Featured Artist profile badge:

We've also noted how many of you absolutely *hated* the Hidden mod in these playlists, so we'll take a different approach to next month's playlists (which involves freemod!). Those will drop at the turn of the month, so stay tuned!

Until then, sit tight and map some **Toromaru** songs.
