With Project Loved going on for several years now, it's time to decide the future of the category.

It's been about [4 years](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/703347) since the last time we've polled the community on the state the Loved category. With recent discussion among the Project Loved team, now is the perfect time for us to hear your input once again, so we've set up a community survey for you to let us know how we should move forward.

The survey is meant to be all-encompassing, and it should take no more than 5 minutes to complete.

If you would also like to raise discussion regarding anything mentioned in the survey or about Project Loved in general, the best place to do so would be the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) in the `#osu-loved` channel. This is where you can interact directly with the official team behind Project Loved. We also have a dedicated [forum thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1526909) for elaborating on your thoughts.

The results of this survey will be visible before the **April 2022** round of Project Loved. This will allow the Project Loved team to discuss the survey results and make appropriate changes to the category. Every voice will be heard, so don't hesitate to give us your honest feedback! Thank you for your interest in making the Loved category a better place. <3
