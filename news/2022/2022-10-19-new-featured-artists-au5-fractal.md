Iconic duo **Au5** and **Fractal** crash-land into our Featured Artist collection.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-10-19-new-featured-artists-au5-fractal/header.jpg)

The sonic boom from their crash landing can't compare to the blasting bass in their songs though.

Both **Au5** and **Fractal** are masters of their craft: maestros of all realms of electronic music, inspiring futuristic landscapes solely with the power of sound.

That said, it should come as no surprise that tunes from both of these artists have been cornerstones in tech mapping history. Beatmaps like [Impulse](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/705788) and [Moonland](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/790382) on **Au5**'s side, along with [Spection](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/942117) and [Collide](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/753365) on **Fractal**'s end are iconic when it comes to insane slider-oriented mapping. And let's not forget songs like [Halcyon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1135050) and [Blue](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/305381) — collaborations between both artists that are perfect canvases for revolutionary mapping.

That's enough gushing for now. You have some songs to map.
