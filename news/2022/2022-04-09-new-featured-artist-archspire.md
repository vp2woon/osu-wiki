The term "tech mapping" is usually reserved for electronic rhythm game tunes, but **Archspire** is here to shift the paradigm. This technical death metal band showcases extraordinarily complicated rhythms with skull-vibrating note density, putting them in a position beyond comparison.

**5** tracks from their breakthrough album *Relentless Mutation* are up for grabs from [**Archspire**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/256).

Wondering what all the hype is about? Witness how **Archspire**'s sound translates to mapping through [Archspire - A Dark Horizontal](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1340043) in this video, then explore the rest of what's available:
