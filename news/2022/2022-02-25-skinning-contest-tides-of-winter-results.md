No matter how well the titular tides of winter were represented throughout all **17** skins, your votes ultimately decided the most wintry of the bunch.

Bitter choices were made with so few votes to go around, yet you managed to throw your *snowballots* right back at us in numbers we never expected, with a total of **17674** frosty votes made away by **6946** unique users barreling into our front yard like an avalanche!

Naturally, it took us a bit of time to count all the votes, make necessary preparations for the announcement and, you know, plough the snow on our yard. So without further ado:

## 3rd Place - Azure Snowfall

Capturing a total of **1697** voters by heart with an exquisite yet simplistic piece of art, [Azure Snowfall](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1498492) by [thetasigma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6234482) achieves 3rd place!

Projecting the tides of winter in a minimalistic approach, Azure Snowfall, as its name suggests, combines the flakes of snow with the beauty of the sky at night. Opting for shades of dark blue tones almost everywhere, the skin neatly and artistically accommodates both snow and sky, providing a stargazing-inspired experience featuring the bluest of zeniths above the mountains, where flakes and stars meet.

The song selection menu greets us with a texture reminiscent of the middle of Alps. The remainder holds an elegant yet minimalistic aura, exemplified in the pause and fail menus. Furthermore, the gameplay section from top to bottom is left fairly simple, which goes with the general theme fascinatingly well! If you don't believe my words, check what sort of a masterpiece Azure Snowfall really is!

Having snowy mountains and shiny stars meet at the horizon, thetasigma gets to achieve the 3rd place profile badge with their Azure Snowfall entry! Congratulations!

## 2nd Place - GanyuTeks:Futur Céleste

**2006** voters were brought a smile by none other than this masterpiece of delicate tech style, letting [GanyuTeks:Futur Céleste](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1489926) by [BPChingu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4236855) claim 2nd place!

As the name might suggest, GanyuTeks:Futur Céleste is heavily inspired by the renowned *Genshin Impact* character Ganyu, and transports her into a futuristic osu! skin theme masterfully. Paying homage to the frigid Cryo element she wields in the original game, the skin is as much icy as it is minimalistic and futuristic, knitted together with an absolutely fantastic choice of colour palette overall.

Within the details there lie certain textual easter-eggy touches, most of which inform the user about hotkeys and functions, while others carry background information regarding Ganyu. From the use of speech bubbles and rectangular layouts to futuristic lines and notations, the skin gives the impression that the player is looking through a visor. In any case, if you are fond of *Genshin Impact* and you would like to have Ganyu assist you in osu! as well, GanyuTeks:Futur Céleste is the perfect skin for you!

Their beloved masterpiece GanyuTeks:Futur Céleste reserves BPChingu 2nd place! Of course, what would be a more meaningful award than having Ganyu immortalised as their profile badge for such a delightful entry?

## Winner - - 『Wintherest』 -

With majestic flair, crafted by the hands of a skinner extraordinaire, [- 『Wintherest』 -](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1498493) by [Redo\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7122165) takes the lead with **2347** votes, surpassing 2nd place with quite the margin!

Utilising minimalistic and modern styling methods, - 『Wintherest』 - brings the serenity of a wintry day and the vivid display of aurorae together on your osu! client. The way snow is accumulated near the play button over which the logo of the skin is placed ensures a smooth transition to the anthracite layer that looks like a frosted glass filtering the lights of colour. On top of that, the use of white speech bubbles combined with various minuscule indicators strenghtens the skin's minimalistic ambience even further.

Moreover, - 『Wintherest』 - not only keeps its minimalist and modern look consistent all throughout the skin, but gives the aurora effect further presence, showcased especially on the results screen. The gameplay interface on the other hand, seems to be unable to keep itself away from this aurora effect, which was placed onto the health, combo and score indicators individually, along with the usual minimalistic aura. Without a doubt, Redo\_ did a fantastic job with this one, earning the community's approval as the most *Winteresting* pick of all.

\- 『Wintherest』 - sure did win over the rest, and for that Redo\_ gets a reward fit for a champion, a profile badge featuring the very logo of their own masterpiece! Big congratulations to Redo\_!
