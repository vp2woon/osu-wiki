Bouncing onto the osu! shores is **Beach Bunny**, our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/277/header.jpg)

A bedroom solo project that transformed into a punk rock unit racking up millions of plays, **Beach Bunny** brings emotional indie tunes to the mainstream. And when we say "the mainstream", we obviously mean to the ears of our niche circle clicking community.

[**Beach Bunny**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/277) has a solid **5** tracks spread across their discography, including *Prom Queen* — a tune that zoomer osu! TikTok-ers are guaranteed to recognize.

We don't have a video paired with this release, so you better check out every song that's up for grabs:
