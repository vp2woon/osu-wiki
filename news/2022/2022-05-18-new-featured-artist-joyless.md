Delivering California surf punk from the distant shores of Norway, **JOYLESS** joins our Featured Artist collection!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/267/header.jpg)

osu! is one of the few rhythm games that promotes *every* genre of music, and **JOYLESS** is here to help prove it. These catchy punk tunes are far from average rhythm game content, but mappers who love artists like [*PUP*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/79) will discover that **JOYLESS** is their next addiction.

**7** songs are up for the taking, all pre-timed and available from [**JOYLESS**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/267).

What's more engaging than an osu! liveplay? TWO liveplays. Watch [Monko2k](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4852013) and [Kahli](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8926244) play two difficulties of [JOYLESS - Bristol](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1728251) at the same time, then try out a few maps for yourself:
