**Abuse** diversifies our Featured Artist catalogue with a collection of unorthodox tracks!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/294/header.jpg)

Japanese producer **Abuse** is best known for deconstructing and reconstructing elements of genres like pop, rock, and noise music to formulate his own unmatched styles — all with a bit of VOCALOID sprinkled on top.

**8** one-of-a-kind tunes are now available from [**Abuse**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/294). Treat them nicely.

An appropriately avant-garde beatmap of [Shinjuku Jack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1627361) by [Ryuusei Aika](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7777875) introduced **Abuse** to the osu! scene. Earlier this week, [Yugu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3161834) of the Mappers' Guild brought their own beatmap of [Shinjuku Jack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1817377) to the table. See both of them side by side in the showcase video below, then explore the rest of what's in store:

If you're in search of a completely fresh sound to map, you're doing yourself a disservice by not looking through [**Abuse**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/294). Seriously.

If you're looking for more music, the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) might be worth checking out too. Stay tuned for another artist release next Wednesday!
