2021 sure was something! Help us decide your Community Favourite in all four game modes by voting for your ten most-liked maps of 2021 today!

Ever since an ancient time now long lost to memory, the osu! community has held a yearly poll titled as Community Choice (or if you're *really* old, the 'Best of' series) where everybody all gets together and furiously discusses and votes on their favourite maps with one another.

To the surprise of exactly nobody, 2021 is in fact a year like any other, and naturally, this means that you're entitled to **10 votes per game mode** in the latest Community Choice polls to make your stance known on the best beatmaps of 2021.

There's one catch: **you have to have played the map at least once during 2021**. Duh.

The top 10 most popular picks for each game mode will be appointed as the Community Favourites of 2021, earning the #1 pick a shiny new profile badge and 6 months of osu!supporter to carry them halfway through this year towards their next award-winning creation.

Much like last year, we'll also be doing a special **Mappers' Favourite of 2021** award to spice things up a bit for each game mode. If you've ranked a map at any point in history, your vote will automagically count towards this particular award ⁠— you don't need to do anything else to participate outside of voting normally.

To get the ball rolling, we've decided to also include some entirely unrelated statistics below to help illustrate just how much of a titan 2021 was for mapping:

- In osu! during 2021, **18,115** difficulties were ranked across **3278** sets for a total of **39,136** minutes of content. This is roughly **25%** more beatmap sets overall than 2020. That's a lot of circles!
- In osu!taiko during 2021, **3,546** difficulties were ranked across **866** sets for a total of **9,573** minutes of content. This is roughly **7%** lower than 2020's numbers. Drumming isn't easy, you know!
- In osu!catch during 2021, **1,776** difficulties were ranked across **350** sets for a total of **3,829** minutes of content. This is roughly **31%** more beatmap sets overall than 2020. Last year was jam-packed full of fruity fibre.
- In osu!mania during 2021, **2,200** difficulties were ranked across **413** sets for a total of **5,649** minutes of content. This is roughly **32%** more beatmap sets overall than 2020. The key smashers are rising up!

Excited? You should be! Now, go vote:

- [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/138)
- [osu!taiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/139)
- [osu!catch](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/140)
- [osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/141)

The voting will remain open for **14 days** from the date of this post, so make sure to get involved quick!

If you don't, you'll risk having to fume at having no say in who ends up as the Community Favourites. In all honesty, even if you do, some of you are going to fume anyway. At least if you vote, you can pretend you're some kind of anime protagonist raging against the tyranny of an unfair world, so go vote, Kirito!
