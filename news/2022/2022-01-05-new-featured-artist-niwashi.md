**NIWASHI** swings into the Featured Artist lineup as our first artist of the year!

Who would've guessed that jazz and rhythm games could work hand in hand?

**NIWASHI**, clearly.

Japanese producer **NIWASHI** is known for their extensive collection of artcore tracks, many of which intently give off a speedy jazz vibe.

**14** staggering tracks. One fantastic beatmapper (that's you). Get started already by finding your favourite track from [**NIWASHI**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/228) and opening its beatmap template in the editor.

The complexity and density of these tracks perfectly lends to novel beatmaps, as made clear through [Down](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4694602)'s iconic beatmap of [Playing With Ruby](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1306570). See the map's rank \#1 and \#2 scores in the video below, then check out the rest of what's up for grabs:

2022 is the year *you* learn how to map, and [**NIWASHI**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/228) is a good place to start. If you need some beginner advice, we suggest actually opening the editor instead of saying "I want to map" while never actually trying.

Want more music in your circle-clicking life? The [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) can help with that. New artist announcements come every Wednesday and Saturday, and our feed is the first place you'll hear about it!

Generic self-promotion spiel aside, we think you'll appreciate our upcoming Featured Artists. Stay tuned for more!
