Our Featured Artist collection has been missing one thing: **Satyr**.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/328/header.jpg)

You thought tech mapping was reserved for electronic producers like [Camellia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31) or [BlackY](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/150). You were clearly wrong.

Progressive rock band **Satyr** brings a new type of complexity, showcasing unorthodox song structure and unconventional rhythms through metal band instrumentation.

**5** uncontrollable tracks have been unleashed on [**Satyr**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/328), each accompanied by a handy set of timing points.

You need to hear **Satyr** to truly understand what the hype is all about. Check out [Topoi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6157605) play through this brand-new map of [Picayune](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1902228), then look through the rest of what's available:
