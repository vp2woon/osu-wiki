Traverse unknown territory with our latest Featured Artist **Atavistia**!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/237/header.jpg)

The musical equivalent of a divine raging tempest, **Atavistia** is a relatively new symphonic death metal group based out of Vancouver, Canada. The band has drawn inspiration from grandiose metal units like *Wintersun* and *Ensiferum*, lending to the classical Nordic sound that metalheads know all too well.

Split between their two major album releases, **6** epic marathon-length tracks are available in this bundle from [**Atavistia**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/237)!

Curious how the underground metal circuit intersects with osu!? Check out the video below comparing rhythm choices between osu! and osu!taiko beatmaps, then dip your toes into the other previews:
