Player turned musician, **SAMString** joins osu! as our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/273/header.jpg)

**SAMString** has been an avid circle clicker since 2015. Admiring renowned artists on osu! like [Camellia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31) along with other personal favourites, **SAMString** has defined his own brand of psytrance, deep house, and drum & bass that blend modern styles with classical instrumentation.

**14** tracks. [**SAMString**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/273). You know what to do.

One of **SAMString**'s biggest contributions to the osu! community has been a song composed specifically for a community tournament's tiebreaker: [NUMA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1570528). Experience this monumentally challenging map through its top 4 scores, then treat yourself to everything else **SAMString** has to offer:
