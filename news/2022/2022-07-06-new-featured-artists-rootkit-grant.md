Two flagship members of the [**Monstercat**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/255) repertoire sail into our Featured Artist collection!

**Rootkit** and **Grant** are both masters of their crafts. While **Rootkit** has a drum & bass throughline connecting all of his diverse tunes, **Grant** explores a number of electronic designs. Of course, both of their styles have already proven themselves to be perfect fits for the osu! community, through beatmaps like [Rootkit - Against The Sun (feat. Anna Yvette)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/340263) or [Grant - Starship](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/609900)!

We're working with *a lot* of artists through **Monstercat**, some of which have bigger tracklists than others. Because both of these lists are on the slimmer side, we've decided to pair them together in this announcement!

That said, check out [**Rootkit**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/280) and [**Grant**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/281) for a total of **6** new song additions!

Too busy to play through some maps on your own? See how these songs translate to mapping through this quick video, then check out the other previews below:

As soon as you're ready to start mapping (also known as *right now*), sort through [**Rootkit**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/280) and [**Grant**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/281)! This two-for-one deal won't come by often!

In case you missed our [Featured Artist Track Updates newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-07-02-featured-artist-track-updates-summer-2022), we've also launched a new round of [**Featured Artist playlists**](/wiki/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists)! Check those out in osu!(lazer) if you're at all curious about the long-term future of osu! (and maybe check out the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) if you're curious about the short term).

We'll see you on Saturday for another artist announcement!
