[**Yunosuke**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/244) has even more musical gems for you to oggle at, so take a break from your search for the Elden Ring and start mapping. We guarantee that designing sliders will be just as engaging and/or frustrating as those boss fights.

Once that's done, the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) will be waiting with open arms to showcase our next Featured Artist. Be ready for that next Saturday, and until then, have fun mapping!
