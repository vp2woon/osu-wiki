**121** artists have set forth to end an era in osu! with their masterful creations, and now it falls to us to decide the finalists... with only **15** votes each!

With the festive season in full swing and the end of the year not far off, what better time is there to settle down for a couple of minutes and vote on your favourite bits of osu! fan art to close out the year?

Courtesy of one pishifat (for whom this very video is his *third* creation today, on Christmas Eve, bless his diligent soul), we've got a neat preview video showcasing a brief glimpse of what is up for voting, all set to the tunes of [2ToneDisco](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/157) x Kabuki's *Giga*:

We sure don't need to tell you that the window is tight this year, with 2023 *very* fast approaching. The vote will be up for only **7 days** from the date of this post, so make sure to get in quick and choose your favourites while the opportunity is still around!

A selection from the top-voted entries will make it to the game's main menu as the New Beginnings seasonal backgrounds, and their creators will also receive 3 months of osu!supporter.

And as always, the top 3 voted entries will be enshrined upon their author's profiles forever more as bespoke profile badges - a prize you can quite literally not get anywhere else.

A big thanks to everyone who took time out of the holiday season to participate, and we hope the change in schedule worked out a little better for you!

For the rest of us, we must now agonize over how to spend our votes. What wonderful woe.
