**Vansire** permeates both the Featured Artist library and your dreams.

High tempos and overly complex rhythms are what you'd expect from rhythm games, but we're switching things up today.

**Vansire** is an atmospheric indie pop band from the heart of the American Midwest. Their works started as amateur songs recording in their bedrooms, and have since evolved into popular songs with millions of streams (...still recorded in their bedrooms, basements, or living rooms).

Despite being more calm than the usual rhythm game fare, **Vansire**'s music has undoubtedly become ingrained in osu! culture. We've snagged **13** tracks, all of which are ready to be mapped from [**Vansire**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/232).

Curious what this deviation from the norm sounds like? Take a peek this video of [Metamodernity](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1080204) and its leaderboard's \#1 score featuring 3 mods, then traverse through the rest of these previews:
