Famed for composing songs for *07th Expansion*'s cult classic *Umineko no Naku Koro ni*, the legend **-45** (a.k.a. Akito Yoshikawa) finally joins our Featured Artists!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/297/header.jpg)

**-45**'s sound has been a constant presence on osu! for more than a decade. Introduced through [AngelHoney](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/104401)'s 2010 beatmap for [Aci-L](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/13169) and further popularized by [Natteke](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/157177)'s 2011 beatmap of [Eiji Kuinbii](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/38235), this old-school electro sound has become a staple to circle clickers worldwide.

There's no shortage of **-45** tunes around here. We've picked up an unfathomable **117** songs for [**-45**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/297), all of which are available for mapping until literally the end of time.

It's not exactly possible to preview *every song*, but take a quick peek at **9** different songs popularized on osu! through this video, then play through the corresponding maps below:
