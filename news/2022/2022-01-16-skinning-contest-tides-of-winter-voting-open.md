In case you've been living under a rock, the aptly-titled Skinning Contest is just that - a contest about skinning! Intrepid artists and designers from all across the community have put themselves and their work forward in an effort to create the best winter-themed skin possible, and now it is time to vote on their frigid labours.

There are a total of **17 freezing entries** delicately crafted by **17 extraordinary skinners**. The task of choosing the coldest (that is, the *coolest*) falls squarely into your mittens! But before you cast your votes, be sure to check them all out by yourself in order to appreciate all the effort put into them.

All of these majestic icy-cold pieces of artistry now reside within our resident deep freezer, otherwise known as the one and only [completed skins compendium](https://compendium.skinship.xyz/contests/2). You are highly encouraged to browse around and examine them thoroughly. However, be sure to wear your gloves, as some of these might be the most frosty skins you'll ever see!

If you're not sure where to start, don't worry, we've prepared showcase videos of each submission to help you consider them fully. Take a seat by the hearth and watch them all on the playlist below:

If you have your mind made up, head over to the [contest page](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/137) and place the **3 stars** granted to you onto the submissions that gave you the most chills. But you have to be quick, because they may melt away in **2 weeks time**!
