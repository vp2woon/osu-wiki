The ghoulishly-difficult voting has finished, and we emerge now into the moonlight with our latest Halloween-themed finalists!

True terror was the name of the game all throughout this year's Halloween Fanart contest, from the ever-shrinking deadlines for both entry submission and voting times to the insane quality of just about every piece put forward for us to agonize over.

Somehow, **6872** unique voters have come out unscathed from it all, and from their toils, **20** finalists have been decided.

Let's get straight into things and remember, clicking any banner will take you to a full-size version:

[**Dreamxiety**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233) takes 1st place yet again with **3749** votes with her charming rendition of a cat-eared and costumed pippi perched amidst a pumpkin throne of candies and candycorn, complete with a devilishly-handsome don and a suspiciously skeletal Chirou.

This victory marks Dreamxiety's *fourth* time in the top spot, and the fifth time as a fanart finalist overall. It also carries on her streak from last year's Halloween contest, and it only takes a good look with one's eyeballs to figure out why. Amazing work!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/RedcXca.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/RedcXca.png)

[**RedcXca**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14056601)'s portrayal of a witchy Alisa, a rabbit-eared and bat-winged pippi plus a piratical don enchanted **3369** (nice) voters with seasonally-appropriate spookage.

It always puts a smile on our faces when our community mascots take on center-stage from time to time, and judging from the numbers here, we figure you feel the same way!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/Sjao.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/Sjao.png)

The sanguine legacy of [**Sjao**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7295733)'s vampiric mascot series continues, with a surprisingly winsome fanged pippi making thralls from **3089** voters.

Just stunning, really. The colour work is as extraordinary as always from a Sjao piece!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/ksenikust.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/ksenikust.png)

Halloween means kemonomimi costumes, and [**ksenikust**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8938068) happily obliged with their rendition of a cat-costumed pippi striking a nya pose to the approval of **2487** voters.

This one's is bound to end up as a wallpaper on *many* devices, let's be honest with ourselves.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/Kitcat.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/Kitcat.png)

[**Kitcat**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/30329028) turned a distinctly dark seasonal spectacle into a colourful masterpiece featuring pippi, mocha, Yuzu and a ton more minor mascots for a total of **2252** votes.

This one practically leapt out of the screen during the voting phase with such evocative use of contrast and palette to accentuate some incredibly creative composition.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/ZunK.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/ZunK.png)

[**ZunK**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1070783)'s rendition of a broom-riding pippi and a tome-surfing Mocha earned praise from **2240** familiars. We're not quite sure Mocha has got the hang of working that thing yet, but she'll get there eventually!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/MistyCRose.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/MistyCRose.png)

[**MistyCRose**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7259349)'s stylishly spooky catgirl pippi and ghostly Mocha startled **2231** voters into immediately hitting the button, potentially several times in row.

It's spooky, it's cute, so we're calling it scute.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/sonyaa.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/sonyaa.png)

**2148** voters could not resist the sparkling allure of [**sonyaa**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16964067)'s adorable take on Mocha and pippi all costumed-up.

We like to think the voters are all the blushing ghosts flying around. Except for that one particular ghost which is a little bit different from all the others...

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/_reptani.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/_reptani.png)

**2075** could not look away (in horror) from [**_reptani**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13559093)'s lavishly lacey pippi lounging luxuriously in a recently unearthed coffin.

Lace! Frills! Beads! So many beads. If you count them all, you'll find a fearsome, forbidden fright. Don't mention it in the comments.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/DGen.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/DGen.png)

The cheers of **2067** voters rang forth to the ears of [**DGen**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13290907)'s take on pippi observing the grand spectacle of what we can only assume is the World Cups within a somewhat *suspicious* stadium, complete with pumpkin and don hot-air balloons.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/Kyatoa.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/Kyatoa.png)

**1939** became lost in a field of blood-hued flowers rendered by [**Kyatoa**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13473722)'s hand, only to be met with the palette-swapped portrayals of Mocha and pippi in some devilishly debonair costumes.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/CylinDron.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/CylinDron.png)

**1895** received a visit from [**CylinDron**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12905494)'s imagining of the fabled ghost of choked score's past after one of them broke the veil between planes by throwing their tablet pen straight through reality.

Hold on a second, what's she pointing at?

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/Luvince.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/Luvince.png)

**1847** voters gazed up to witness a starshower on Hallow's Eve only to catch sight of [**Luvince**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14356908)'s rendition of pippi and Mocha soaring high above the cityscape upon brooms amidst a flock of ravens. pippi looks surprised by what she sees, while Mocha sees only a candy apple. Cronch cronch.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/Snowlite.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/Snowlite.png)

**1842** voters were intimidated by [**Snowlite**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12007955)'s witch pippi and her comically huge hat. Truly, horror beyond compare... if it weren't so adorable. What terrors lie hidden beneath, we wonder...

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/Roro-san.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/Roro-san.png)

**1702** reflexively smashed the voting button in pure, unbridled horror at [**Roro-san**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11084479)'s manifestation of an ABSOLUTELY MANIC pippi.

This is pure terror at its finest, without a hint of gore. In that regard, it's an absolute masterpiece. So potent in fact, that we unfortunately cannot include it on the main menu for fear of terrorizing the more scare-susceptible among us.

However, to recognize this act of artly accomplishment, we'll be awarding this one a very special *Most Spooktacular* profile badge, so that anyone who visits Roro-san's profile in the future will feel the fear we all felt during the past week or so.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/Ariisha.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/Ariisha.png)

[**Ariisha**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6246943)'s dramatic presentation of a demon queen pippi terrorizing her hapless subjects (namely Mocha and Yuzu) in cages earned the applause of **1683** loyal subjects. Will hero Mani and shrine maiden Mari save the two from the clutches of chef Chirou and a handful of terrible ghosts?

Tune in next year to find out (we hope)!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/NyamenRamen.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/NyamenRamen.png)

[**NyamenRamen**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/26746217)'s take on pippi tempted **1648** voters with promises of delicious (and definitely not poisoned) apples. Some absolutely beautiful stylisation and implied motion in this piece, it practically *pops* with colour.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/TenkaRen.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/TenkaRen.png)

**1606** voters pretended to be scared while [**TenkaRen**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/30905519)'s adorable, pumpkin-headed Chirou attempted to terrorize them for candy. *Attempted* being the key word here.

She's trying her best, guys. Just smile and hand it over. Do not pat the pumpkin head. Resist.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/Amplui.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/Amplui.png)

**1547** servants fled in horror to vote at once for [**Amplui**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24820805)'s vampiric pippi, complete with an utterly striking contrast between sombre moonlight blues and bloody reds, plus an ornate gothic ensemble.

Absolutely gorgeous, and a real stand out!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/banners/Ryanoo.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/154/winners/Ryanoo.png)

**1540** voters watched along as [**Ryanoo**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/27725651)'s Chirou and pippi took stock of their candy claims around a campfire beneath a moonlit sky.

All bar the Most Spooktacular entry described above are available now in-game as the Seasonal backgrounds for Halloween. Enjoy them while they last however, the spellbound enchantments that come with Hallow's Eve fade as quickly as they appear, so they won't linger long!

The top 3 finalists (plus the Most Spooktacular entry) will enjoy bespoke profile badges added to their profiles to celebrate their win, and all finalists listed above will receive 3 months of osu!supporter for their incredible efforts.

A huge thank you to everyone who entered and voted this time around, especially due to the unexpectedly cramped schedule we had to operate with this time. We'll be making some changes to ensure the Halloween contest in particular starts earlier next year, so there's more time for both artists and voters to do their thing.

Check out the [Halloween 2022 Fanart Contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/154) for the full rundown of how the voting went, plus handy links to the authors of each piece. Consider following a few on your favourite social media/art platform of choice if you like what you saw!

As always, Halloween signals the midway point of what we've come to know as "fanart season". We'll hope to see you again sometime next month for the start of the Winter Fanart contest!
