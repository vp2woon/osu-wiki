A musician with more aliases than you'd expect, **DGK** joins the lineup as our latest Featured Artist!

You might also recognize **DGK** as *JurokuNeta.*, *NoKANY*, or even *Meisenp*. Regardless of what name he goes by, his sound is an undeniably solid fit for circle clicking.

Chinese producer **DGK** has taken notes from rhythm game composition greats like *Ryu\** and *M2U* to create his own brand of electronic intensity, landing him feature spots in games like *Muse Dash*.

We've snagged **9** tracks for [**DGK**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/229), all emitting that perfect *rhythm game song* aura. You know what we're talking about. You know you like it.
