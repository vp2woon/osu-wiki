@everyone **Exyl** is officially an osu! Featured Artist.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/285/header.jpg)

A producer of electronic tunes and a creator of accompanying, self-produced animations focused on oriental/futuristic themes, **Exyl** understands osu! culture too well.

**8** insanely awesome tunes can be found on [**Exyl**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/285).

If you've ever played [Ping 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1688877), you know exactly the kind of vibe **Exyl**'s music is known for. If you haven't heard anything from **Exyl** yet, watch through this video of osu!(lazer)'s new Singletap mod, then check out a few more **Exyl** classics:
