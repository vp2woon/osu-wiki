**A.SAKA** whirlwinds their way into our Featured Artist collection!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/253/header.jpg)

Specializing in Japanese-style instrumental tunes that translate perfectly to rhythm games, **A.SAKA**'s sound has unsurprisingly been a hit on osu! since day 1. With multiple beatmaps of their most popular track [Nanatsu Issenzakura](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=%22Nanatsu%20Issenzakura%22) reaching over a million plays, there's a good chance you're already familiar with **A.SAKA**'s legendary sound.

We've scooped up **12** songs for [**A.SAKA**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/253) (obviously including *Nanatsu Issenzakura*).

If you're one of the four osu! players who somehow *hasn't* heard this timeless classic, shift your attention towards this multi-mode gameplay video, then peek at the rest of **A.SAKA**'s awesome track previews below:
