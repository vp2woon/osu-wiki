**Blind Guardian** stands vigil between you and our Featured Artist library, what will you do? Listen to some new sick metal tunes, of course!

Older than ~99.9% of osu! players, **Blind Guardian** is a German metal unit that's been blasting beats since as far back as 1984. For those out of the loop, this band laid the groundwork for the power metal genre throughout their nearly 40-year lifespan, properly establishing their status as a metal legend.

And through an insane turn of events, this legendary band is now officially a part of osu!.

Stream-focused mapping has been a rising trend lately, and **Blind Guardian** has been a major contributor!
