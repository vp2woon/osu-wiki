2 months ago, the [osu!taiko Featured Artist Cup](/wiki/Contests/o!tFAC) opened its gates to the world for the [third time](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-10-23-osutaiko-featured-artist-cup-3), and after careful deliberation, we're finally ready to crown the winners of this iteration!

Before we proceed, we'd like to announce that due to the high amount of entries, and the sheer quality of the submissions, we will be awarding the **top 3 teams** with badges, instead of only the winning team! Check out the [following page](/wiki/Contests/o!tFAC/3#prizes) for a detailed list of the rewards.
