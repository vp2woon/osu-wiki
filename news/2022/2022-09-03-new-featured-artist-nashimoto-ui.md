Did you know [**Nashimoto Ui**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/298) comes packed with pre-timed beatmap templates for the songs above and more? Obviously you did. And obviously you're about to look at the songs and find something to map.

Next release will be a double-feature for a couple more [Monstercat](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/255) entrants, so stick around the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for news on that!

We'll see you Wednesday!
