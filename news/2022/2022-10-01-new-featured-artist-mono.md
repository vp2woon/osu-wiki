**Mono.** brightens the stage as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/307/header.jpg)

Japanese producer **Mono.** takes notes from two polar opposites: high-speed chaos found exclusively in rhythm games, and upbeat melodies in anime tunes.

To hear exactly how those influences slot together, explore **9** upbeat and densely packed tracks on [**Mono.**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/307)!

Given the rhythmic complexity of **Mono.**'s music, it's no surprise that the osu!mania community was first to take on the challenge. Check out this multi-play comparison of [ST4RDUST\*XABER](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1658451), then preview the rest of the songs below:
