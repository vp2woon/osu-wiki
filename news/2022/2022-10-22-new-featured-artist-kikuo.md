**Kikuo** brings nightmares into reality as our newest Featured Artist.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/314/header.jpg)

One listen could tell you that Japanese VOCALOID producer **Kikuo**'s sound is unlike anything you've ever heard. Blending instruments and sound effects to form aural textures you can practically *feel*, **Kikuo** designs songs around unsettling topics in an often uncanny, upbeat style.

A hefty **25** tunes are up for grabs. Peek at the selection from [**Kikuo**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/314).

Honestly speaking, there's no way that words can explain the complexity of **Kikuo**'s style. Do yourself a favour and experience **Kikuo** through this video or any of the maps below:
