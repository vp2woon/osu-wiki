The Elite titles are an acknowledgement of utmost contribution to a given field in the osu! community, ranging from fields like beatmap nomination and mapping, to storyboarding, refereeing and more. Without question, every person who holds such an esteemed title has a storied history of making osu! more awesome, and as always, 2021 was no exception on this front.

Today, we would like to acknowledge some of the best of the best among the Beatmap Nominators. The following accolades have been compiled and written by the members of the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team).

## osu!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-03-22-community-contributors-elite-nominators/AJT.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3181083)

Consistently maintaining incredibly high activity even after becoming a member of the Nomination Assessment Team, [**AJT**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3181083) sports a veritable legion of nominations all across the scene. A large portion of his focus has been pointed towards reaching out to mappers both old and new, helping them to complete their spreads and see their creations finally enter Ranked.

He has also contributed vastly to the catalogue of western music that was ranked in 2021, including the longest Ranked map of the year across all modes in his assistance with [The Way Up](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1485443#osu/3046041) — a complex timing jazz marathon. Nominating a wide variety of map styles, mappers, and song genres without ever lowering his standards, AJT is an ideal example of what we look for in a BN.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-03-22-community-contributors-elite-nominators/Garden.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2849992)

Having the highest total number of unique and new mappers nominated throughout the year, [**Garden**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2849992) has scored at the very top of the current cohort of Beatmap Nominators!

Though his overall score may only be half of that of other nominators, the sheer spike in his outreach towards the future of osu!'s mapping scene highlights his direct commitment towards consistently growing the beatmapping scene, often by focusing on complex sets with diverse difficulty spreads notably large in overall drain time, which has long been a format traditionally looked over by many other Beatmap Nominators.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-03-22-community-contributors-elite-nominators/Hinsvar.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1249323)

Making it through 2021 without a single notable reset, [**Hinsvar**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1249323)'s commitment to reliability and his enduring work ethic spanning over four whole years has earned him recognition as one of our latest Elite Nominators.

He has consistently promoted high effort and high quality beatmaps without missing a beat, showcasing a rarely-celebrated but sorely essential dedication that the modding and mapping scenes require to function.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-03-22-community-contributors-elite-nominators/Luscent.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2688581)

Sporting the best overall contribution made towards longer beatmap sets, [**Luscent**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2688581) is among the top five highest scoring nominators of 2021! His nominations have ranged in style from old to modern and everything in between, promoting a multitude of unique maps all throughout.

Focused primarily on new and innovative maps in terms of reading, rhythm and movement, Luscent's efforts have directly contributed towards providing novel and era-defining challenges to the player base (most notably in beatmaps like [Beat Cannon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1240125), [SPUTNIK-3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1312076) and [true DJ MAG top ranker's song Zenpen \(katagiri Remix\)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1357624)). Beyond just this, he has also been active in terms of helping to revive some ancient sets that have gone years without proper attention and seeing them brought back to life, such as [Raikou -3rd Desire-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/143316).

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-03-22-community-contributors-elite-nominators/StarCastler.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12402453)

One of the friendliest faces around in the Beatmap Nominators, [**StarCastler**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12402453) blazed through 2021 without a single notable reset!

Her consistently high-value nominations were pulled off without a hitch, and her presence in quality assurance has been felt more than most other Beatmap Nominators with significant contributions made especially towards notable resets. She has also been extremely proactive in reviving older mappers’ sets and pushing old-styled maps, all whilst remaining incredibly thorough in her modding and endeavouring to approach issues through the mapper's perspective as much as possible.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-03-22-community-contributors-elite-nominators/UberFazz.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8646059)

[**UberFazz**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8646059) powered through 2021 consistently pushing a wide variety of maps in large quantities, even whilst balancing the workload of being a member of the Nomination Assessment Team. He has scored amongst the top five Beatmap Nominators overall, making significant contribution to overall resets and tackling many especially large and daunting mapsets.

He is also very proactive in pushing interesting sets that would otherwise be left to languish in the graveyard, and is one of the main forces towards bringing more top-end maps into ranked, having nominated the three most difficult maps of 2021 ([Voyage](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1201974), [Deadly force - Put an end](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1390177) and [VVelcome](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1235627)).

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-03-22-community-contributors-elite-nominators/VINXIS.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4323406)

Likely a familiar face to most people reading, [**VINXIS**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4323406) is already a renowned figure across the osu! community for his mapping, tournament organization and musical work as a [Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/22). In a surprise to exactly nobody, it also turns out that VINXIS is also an exceptional Beatmap Nominator as well!

VINXIS took it upon himself to reach out to beloved older mappers in order to promote their otherwise stagnant maps all throughout 2021. In addition, his dedication towards embracing as many musical styles and genres as much as possible plus his penchant for providing concise and useful feedback has made his presence in the modding and mapping scene keenly felt by many.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-03-22-community-contributors-elite-nominators/Zer0.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4260033)

A winner of a highly coveted *white mug* for nominating many new mappers' creations earlier in 2021, [**Zer0-**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4260033) has helped massively in cultivating the modding and mapping scene throughout their brief stint as a Beatmap Nominator.

During this time, they almost single-handedly revived the venerable drum and bass genre in Ranked, all while catapulting many now astronomically popular maps such as [The Words I Never Said](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1470072) and [USSEEWA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1322727) into the limelight for many to enjoy.

In the words of the NAT, one could say that Zer0- is both drummed and based.

## osu!taiko

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-03-22-community-contributors-elite-nominators/Hivie.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976)

Making his debut in the Beatmap Nominators during January 2021, [**Hivie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976) quickly proved himself to be one of the most dedicated nominators the mode has possibly ever seen, reaching over 160 nominations with an excellent incident ratio in a very short time.

Not merely content with his top-tier activity levels, Hivie took the initiative to get involved in many projects within the modding and mapping community, such as assisting with the Community Mentorship program, moderating the osu!taiko Modding & Mapping Hub Discord server, assisting Project Loved in multiple domains and now even managing the returning Beatmap Spotlights. Hivie has been simply *everywhere* at this point, and has continued to excel in all of it.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-03-22-community-contributors-elite-nominators/ikin5050.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4007649)

Exploding into the Beatmap Nominators in late 2020, [**ikin5050**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4007649) is another example of stunning dedication to the scene with over 140 nominations made throughout his tenure, all showcasing a deep commitment to top-level modding quality and a great desire to push forward the future of mapping in osu!taiko.

From his time as a mentee in the Community Mentorship program, ikin5050 has come a long way, having since taken mentees of his own and now reached the pinnacle of achievement in the Beatmap Nominators, something he more than deserves given his integral place in the osu!taiko community overall.

## osu!catch

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-03-22-community-contributors-elite-nominators/Secre.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2306637)

The most active osu!catch Beatmap Nominator of 2021 without contest, [**Secre**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2306637) has left a significant mark on the scene with his dedicated drive towards helping many mappers get their works situated in Ranked.

His outstanding ambition for checking qualified mapsets has been instrumental in securing the ongoing quality of many osu!catch beatmaps, and his valuable insight and contribution towards osu!catch-specific Ranking Criteria discussions has been a significant boon for all. He has also since joined the Nomination Assessment Team to continue his efforts in their domain.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-03-22-community-contributors-elite-nominators/Nokashi.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5431196)

A long-standing member of the osu!catch Beatmap Nominator community, [**Nokashi**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5431196) returned to prominence in the scene during late 2020 and has made his contributions well and truly felt since.

Though he wins no awards for an extraordinary quantity of nominations, the sheer quality of his feedback demonstrates an unyielding dedication towards detail and nuance, showing that less truly is sometimes much, much more. His efforts to assist newer mappers attempting to acclimate to the unusual creation environment in osu!catch have not gone unnoticed either, nor have his efforts in other modding-focused projects such as his management of the Community Mentorship program for his game mode.

## osu!mania

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-03-22-community-contributors-elite-nominators/Quenlla.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4725379)

Powering into the osu!mania scene during 2021, it should come as no surprise to anyone that [**Quenlla**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4725379) was easily the uncontested most active Beatmap Nominator. Initially renowned for pushing a lot of variety in the 4K scene, she later pivoted towards helping newer mappers get their work seen and encouraging a goodly number of osu!mania tournament maps to take their rightful place in Ranked.

Quenlla has played a critical role in recent Ranking Criteria revisions and has had a large presence both Project Loved and the osu!mania World Cups, topping it all off with an introduction to the Nomination Assessment Team earlier in 2022.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-03-22-community-contributors-elite-nominators/guden.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065)

Noted across the osu!mania community for his open-mindedness when approaching beatmaps of all kinds, [**guden**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065)'s mixture of modding and curation in the 4K scene has been directly responsible for some of the most innovative and interesting additions to Ranked in recent years, with picks like [Ibitbt](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1287682) and [Xeroa](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1305067) coming to mind.

Splitting his attention between numerous other projects in the scene, guden is especially remarkable for the extremely high quality modding he produces, all while playing a large part in many tournaments as a pooler and mapper alike.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-03-22-community-contributors-elite-nominators/stan.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1653229)

A dedicated Beatmap Nominator since 2018, [**\_Stan**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1653229) has had a noted passion for pushing new beatmaps into the 7K scene, ranging from pleasantly simple to some of the hardest beatmaps seen to date. 2021 was a continuation of this long-standing tradition for him, powering through nearly thirty nominations with some extremely thorough and detailed modding that have showcased not only his dedication towards improving 7K overall, but his experience with the mode as a whole.

Without a doubt, \_Stan is a major force in the 7K scene, and things would be very different without him!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-03-22-community-contributors-elite-nominators/Murumoo.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8001433)

Since the beginning of his nominating career, Murumoo has already proven himself to be one of the most proficient nominators, pushing and delving into a large variety of maps that require considerable time, effort and skill to tackle. Not only that, he has nominated numerous well-received charts, including one of the most popular of the year in *xi-ANiMA*, which went on to achieve rank #2 in the Mapper’s Favourite 2021, as well as *t+pazolite – Tempestissimo* that achieved rank #5 in the Community’s Choice 2021.

Resolving to prove that you can have both quality and quantity together, he has nominated nearly 60 sets in what is one of the highest quantities seen in 2021 from the osu!mania nominator community, which only becomes even more impressive as one realizes the sheer number of difficulties, keymodes and styles this covers. His entirely extraordinary dedication to his role and overall performance as a Beatmap Nominator more than qualifies him for the title of an Elite.

A big thank you goes out to [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323) for organizing and wrangling much of the research needed to make these accolades happen, and the NAT as a whole for writing much of what you see here.

The astute among you will notice two major differences this year — namely that the Elite section is typically bundled with Community Contributors as a whole, and that there are no extra Elite Storyboarders, Mappers or Referees. Due to the large quantity of Elite Nominators this year, we have opted to list them separately from the Community Contributor article, mainly as there are ongoing discussions delaying it from being released in full.

Additionally, we will be considering a second round of Elite additions for 2021 in domains beyond just the Beatmap Nominators. Stay tuned for more news on that front.

As always, we are enormously thankful to host one of the most engaged communities on the internet. osu! is continually shaped by volunteer contributors like our Elites who play a huge part in making osu! as awesome as it is, and it is only through their efforts that we continue to persist and grow as we have for so many years now.

To all those who contribute, you have our utmost gratitude, and we look forward to sharing your accolades with the rest of the community in the future.

—the osu!team
