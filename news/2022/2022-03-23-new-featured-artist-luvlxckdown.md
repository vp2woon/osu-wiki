**luvlxckdown** has joined the meeting.

Everyone picked up new hobbies while stuck at home these last two years. That hobby was "clicking circles super quickly" for most of you, but **luvlxckdown**'s lockdown hobby was *music production*.

Likely the freshest musician in the Featured Artist catalogue to date, **luvlxckdown** is a bedroom pop star known for his hyperpop/hip hop style popularized in Soundcloud production communities.

**5** of these modern tunes are available from [**luvlxckdown**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/250), including the brutally honest [tbh i dont like being social](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1557097) seen in the video below!

Check everything out for yourself:

Instead of playing osu! while half-listening to your next online lecture, try mapping a song from [**luvlxckdown**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/250). Your professor won't notice anyway.

More music is on its way! The [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) will tell you when it's happening, so keep tabs on that and we'll see you on Saturday!
