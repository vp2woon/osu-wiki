Last summer's edition of [**The Roundtable**](/wiki/Tournaments/The_Roundtable) was a gamechanger.

Unprecedented in osu! tournament history, 16 of osu!'s greatest circle clickers flew to Los Angeles, CA, to compete in a 3-day multi-tournament event hosted by [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691).

**The Roundtable II** is set for July 2023, so one question is on everyone's minds:

*Who is invited?*

2 winners from **The Roundtable Qualifier Tournament** will receive a guaranteed invitation to compete in **The Roundtable II** this summer, including travel and living expenses for the duration of the event!
