The community has voted, and the results are in! Behold, the Community and Mapper's Favourites of 2021 for each game mode!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/138/header.jpg)

If you've been living under a rock since 2022 started, the Community Choice polls are a special event we host each year where the community gets together and votes for their favourite maps of the past year in a tally of epic proportions.

Continuing the trend we started last year, this year's results is divvied up into two categories: the Community Favourites and the Mapper's Favourites, which come from the total community vote and a special ranked mapper-only vote respectively.

Onwards to the winners:

## osu!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-02-10-community-choice-results/true-dj-mag.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1357624)

Taking top spot with a whopping **1667** votes is none other than [**sabi - true DJ MAG top ranker's song Zenpen (katagiri Remix)**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1357624) by [**Nathan**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4785223)!

In an outcome that should surprise exactly nobody, this titanic creation burst into the scene nearly mid-way through 2021, turned heads and stole hearts. Showcasing an absolutely colossal collaboration of some of osu!'s most skilled creators in [**toybot**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2848604), [**Sing**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3795679), [**im a fancy lad**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4908650), [**captin1**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/689997), [**Acylica**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1943309), [**Senseabel**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6184386), and [**ScubDomino**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8972308) plus some exemplary storyboarding by [**Tommy Phelps**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10974581), an outpouring of support in such magnitude was almost inevitable.

There was not a moment throughout the entirety of this poll where it was not first place. That has to say something.

Finalists:

- [**II-L - SPUTNIK-3**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1312076) by [**DeviousPanda**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334) with **1411** votes.
- [**Camellia - Flamewall**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1533028) by [**Sotarks**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4452992) with **1169** votes.

- [**inabakumori - Lagtrain**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1313664) by [**Shii**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9186316) with **789** votes.

- [**inabakumori - Lost Umbrella**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1455997) by [**Ryuusei Aika**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7777875) with **618** votes.
- [**Foreground Eclipse - Truths, Ironies, The Secret Lyrics**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/944514) by [**Seni**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4830261) with **494** votes.
- [**YOASOBI - Kaibutsu (TV Size)**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1328989) by [**\[-Evil-\]**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10234313) with **437** votes.

Over in the mapping community, the sentiment is more or less the same, with **sabi - true DJ MAG top ranker's song Zenpen (katagiri Remix)** taking top place in the Mapper's Favourite category with a stonking **95** total votes, making it the first ever map to simultaneously win both Favourite categories at once.

Throughout the entire history of the Community Choice and "Best Of" polls, 2021 may have created a winner in both categories that is actually not controversial. What strange times we live in.

Well deserved!

Living up 2021 to the fullest, the osu!taiko community ejected all reason out of the airlock and threw their weight behind [**Leonz - Among Us Trap Remix (Among Drip Theme Song)**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1421463) with **78** votes.

Moving on to a set with some actual thought behind it, we arrive at the Mapper's Favourite category, which is very interestingly deadlocked in a two-way tie between [**Tanchiky - ENERGY SYNERGY MATRIX**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1247020) by [**Genjuro**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3196091), and [**Dz'Xa - RAGECONTROLEX**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1408772) by [**tasuke912**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767), both rocking exactly **24** votes.

Since we're not going to cut a badge in half and give them one bit each, they both go home with the Mapper's Favourite accolade. Congratulations!

## osu!catch

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-02-10-community-choice-results/take.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1295206)

Screaming to the top of the voting at a whopping 5 to 315+ BPM (Bamboo Per Minute) is none other than [**Risshuu feat. Choko - Take**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1295206) by [**Kukkai**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7811952) with **72** total votes as the newest Community Favourite map. Good luck getting the track out of your head!

A dedicated Rish fanatic, Kukkai has been hard at work on their aptly titled "Rish feat. Choko Project", which features not only this map, but also nearly four others in a true self-made labour of love for obnoxiously catchy rhythmic masterpieces.

Finalists:

- [**UNDEAD CORPORATION - Everything will freeze**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1293905) by [**Daletto**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7592136) with **61** votes.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-02-10-community-choice-results/bagelseeker.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1460413)

In the osu!catch mapping scene however, the competition for this year's Mapper's Favourite was *fierce* to say the least. Edging ahead by a single vote, [**Silentroom vs. Frums - Aegleseeker**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1460413) by [**Jemzuu**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134) very narrowly takes the top spot.

Affectionately dubbed 'bagelseeker' by some intrepid fruit catchers, Aegelseeker is a set among sets, charted entirely up the difficulty spectrum from the very first steps someone can make in osu!catch all the way up to Beyond the Light of Deliverance, which is mapper top difficulty lingo for "breaking your fingers in slow motion".

A set of this magnitude can only arise from the efforts of many, as evidenced by the many collaborators involved, namely: [**autofanboy**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114), the selfsame Kukkai from above, [**Nosuri**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2150415), [**Bunnrei**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284), [**Razor Sharp**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3414261) and [**GiGas**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7300747). Excellent stuff!

## osu!mania

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-02-10-community-choice-results/dark-sheep.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/939798)

Lavished with praise, criticism, despair and jubilation alike, osu!mania's newest Community Favourite is none other than [**Chroma - Dark Sheep**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/939798) by [**Feylos**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4565040) with **278** votes.

Here's a brief snippet from the comments of the map:

- "The feel when osu!mania finally goes moderately distant from the anime monopoly"
- "You don't care about it's overwhelming difficulty, and actually nominate it. You broke the rules. We're very thankful for that."
- "the song from rowbeets!!1!!1111! ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±"

Blood, sweat and tears are the polish that makes a map truly shine, and it is clear that *Dark Sheep* has them in abundance if the community is anything to go by. Well done!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-02-10-community-choice-results/caravan.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1086739)

A trek over to the mapping community's side of things has us set off on a journey with [**John Wasson - Caravan**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1086739) by [**Evening**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2193881) with **24** votes, barely overtaking its nearest rival by a mere four votes.

A nine-minute journey into 8/9 smooth jazz by one of osu!mania's most reputable mappers is possibly the strongest indictment yet for just how good of a map it must be. Getting anybody to play nine minutes of *anything* is a testament to the experience, let alone the herculean effort involved to render this critical masterpiece mappable to begin with.

And so, another year passes, and another Community Choice descends beneath the curtain once more.

2021 sure was something, and some game modes sure had a lot more *something* than others. It's safe to say that the Mapper's Favourite category is definitely sticking around forever now, at least!

[The full voting results are available for view in spreadsheet form here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nP2ZJPeRd8Dxak332zdjx8GMrUoVp-XTPNOYGmdvDJs/edit?usp=sharing), and if you're only interested in the top 50, make sure to check out the [contest listing for each mode](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/138) to see where you're at.

See you again around this time next year!
