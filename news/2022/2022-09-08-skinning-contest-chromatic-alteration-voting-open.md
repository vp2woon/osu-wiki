In case you're new to all this, the Skinning Contest is exactly what it suggests - a contest all about skinning. But this time with a slight twist! Skinning masters from all over the world have strived to create the finest skin imaginable under this edition's restriction: a limited colour palette! Feel free to check out the [announcement newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-07-18-skinning-contest-chromatic-alteration-announcement#challenge:-chromatic-alteration) for details.

Of course, for the skinners extraordinaire there are no obstacles that cannot be overcome. A grand total of **23 skinners** are showcasing their craftsmanship with their beloved **23 valorous entries**. They've played their part masterfully, and now the task of choosing the best among the best falls onto you! But make sure to test them all out first in order to appreciate the effort put into these delicate creations.

All of these majestic pieces of artistry now reside within [the completed skins compendium](https://compendium.skinship.xyz/contests/3). You are highly encouraged to browse around and examine them thoroughly.

If you're not sure where to start, don't worry, we've prepared showcase videos of each submission to help you consider them fully. Take a seat and watch them all on the playlist below:
