A truckload of new **Monstercat** tracks have been delivered to our Featured Artist collection. Come check what's new!

We're going off-script today. Usually we showcase a new Featured Artist every Wednesday and Saturday, but we have a ton of new **Monstercat** tunes to throw at you, and almost all of them come from different artists.

Instead of creating a bunch of Featured Artist listings with 1 song each, we decided to slam all **16** new songs onto the [**Monstercat** listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/255)!

For convenience, here's a full list of every newly added tune:

- **7 Minutes Dead - The Follower**
- **Astronaut - Champions (feat. Harry Brooks Jnr)**
- **Dirtyphonics & Sullivan King - Sight Of Your Soul**
- **Eminence & Soulero - Invisible (feat. Mari-Anna)**
- **Glacier - Neos**
- **Julian Calor - You Might Get Lost**
- **Melano - On Fire**
- **Pixel Terror - Contra (feat. Sara Skinner)**
- **Rogue - Dreams (feat. Laura Brehm)**
- **Seven Lions & Echos - Cold Skin**
- **Slushii - LUV U NEED U**
- **TwoThirds - Breathe**
- **TwoThirds - Bring It Back**
- **Varien - Valkyrie (feat. Laura Brehm)**
- **WRLD - By Design**
- **Zero Hero - Bass Drop**

Curious how these songs translate to circle clicking? Check out this video highlighting a few popular maps from the list above (or if you're more of a hands-on person, play the maps for yourself!):
