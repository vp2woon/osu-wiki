Douse yourself in an endless selection of spicy tunes by **Waterflame**, our newest Featured Artist!

Spawning from community-oriented platform *Newgrounds* and extending his sound to the world of ever-popular video game *Geometry Dash*, **Waterflame** is a composer/sound designer who perfectly slots into the osu! universe.

**34** classics and modern tracks alike are ready for mapping via [**Waterflame**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/291)!
