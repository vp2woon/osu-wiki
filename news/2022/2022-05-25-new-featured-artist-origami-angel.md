Showcasing the cutting-edge state of pop-punk and emo music, **Origami Angel** are an absurdly talented duo who's renowned for having tons of different tempos and styles while always maintaining upbeat, exciting energy. In the last year, the osu! community has shown a massive upsurge of interest in the band, so it should be no surprise that they're here today!

We've picked up **17** tracks from the band, including a bunch from their newest *GAMIGANG* album and the entirety of *Somewhere City*! Check out the full list from [**Origami Angel**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/269).
