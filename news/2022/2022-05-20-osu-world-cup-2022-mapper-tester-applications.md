The 2022 osu! World Cup is slated to the latter half of the year, but preparations are already underway. Read on if you are intested in helping out with mappooling for the year's biggest tournament!

The OWC mappooling team has changed a lot this year and we are always in need of some additional hands in order to continue creating a fantastic experience for players and viewers alike. This year the team so far includes 10 mappoolers with most able to fulfil the high-quality checking requirement that a major tournament like OWC demands, and we are looking to add around 10 more playtesters to make sure everything is as best it can be. There will be 50 to 60 custom-made maps included in the tournament, so there is a great opportunity for many different types of mappers to join the team!

We have created a form for two key roles we are open to, and are looking forward to introducing many more people to this lengthy yet rewarding process.

## Mapper

The osu! World Cup consists of a lot of custom content created exclusively for the tournament. We are looking for experienced mappers able to create maps under certain guidelines and shape them up to be fit for the biggest stage. Custom mapping is something everyone should already be familiar with, but there are some interesting changes in our approach that should let mappers have more creative freedom than before.

Mappers who are accepted into the team may be contacted up until the very end of the tournament ⁠— so please be patient and available!

## Testplayer

As nice as it is to create a ton of content for the tournament, we need just as many players to give insight and help balance all the picks to be appropriate for the tournament. Testers are an extremely vital part of the pooling process and will be expected to play a vast variety of unsubmitted maps over the course of the next 5 months.

This is also a nice way for players who are more than good enough to play in the tournament, but cannot find their way onto teams, to still participate and contribute to the tournament's success. (I'm looking at you, Americans.)

As an important reminder, being accepted into either role means that you will not be able to participate as a player in OWC 2022. If you are interested in joining the team and helping us out, [apply here](https://forms.gle/iQC6GSqPV5z16VKfA)!

Thank you as always to all who make the osu! World Cup the amazing event that it has always been, especially to those who make everything run smoothly behind the scenes. Let's look forward to an amazing experience for everyone this October.
