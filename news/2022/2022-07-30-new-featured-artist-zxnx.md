With an established history of contribution to games like *Cytus 2*, *Dynamix*, *Lanota* and tons more, it should go without saying that **ZxNX** (pronounced Zuna for the curious) knows what's what in the sphere of rhythm gaming music. Creating hits since 2018, we're excited to make 2022 the year of their official introduction to osu!.

We've snagged **15** new tracks that showcase **ZxNX**'s signature sound, which you can find in full over at their [Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/288) right this very moment if you're so inclined.
