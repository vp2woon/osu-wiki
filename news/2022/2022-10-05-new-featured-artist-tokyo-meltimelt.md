Explore a post-apocalyptic landscape with **Tokyo.MeltiMelt**, our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/308/header.jpg)

Gothic metal has become something of a staple in the osu! universe. Artists like [Ariabl'eyeS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/93), [Symholic](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/130), and [Emille's Moonlight Serenade](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/160) have set the stage, and **Tokyo.MeltiMelt** is here to carry forward the tradition.

We've picked up **5** new gothic rock tunes with vocals from icons like *nayuta*, *Hatsuki Yura*, and [*Sennzai*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/110), all ready for mapping from [**Tokyo.MeltiMelt**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/308)!
