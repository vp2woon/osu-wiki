**satella** makes a grand entrance as the latest addition to our Featured Artist collection!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/231/header.jpg)

**satella** is a bit of an anomaly in the rhythm game composition scene. While he's an expert when it comes to complex electronic works (as you'd expect from anyone in the scene), he's *also* exceedingly talented in the realm of emotional orchestral works.

We've snagged **12** tracks covering a healthy mix of both of those musical worlds, all available from [**satella**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/231)!

A few of **satella**'s tracks also include vocal performances by [Aitsuki Nakuru](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/127) and [Sennzai](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/110), including the map that introduced **satella** to osu!: [Irith](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1352944) mapped by [Sakura Airi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8682057). Experience the beatmap and its complementary storyboard through the video below, then check out a few more song previews:

You're alone in the woods. You hear a rustle in the bushes behind you and a chill runs down your spine. As you twist your neck, you see [**satella**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/231) standing directly behind you. You're not sure why, but you have an uncontrollable desire to click it and start your next beatmap using one of its pre-timed beatmap templates. You have no other options.

One more artist is scheduled for this week! The [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) will have all the details once it's announced, so keep an eye on it. Or wait for one of the countless Discord bots to notify you about osu! news posts. Either way you'll be spammed with new music.

Anyway, see you soon!
