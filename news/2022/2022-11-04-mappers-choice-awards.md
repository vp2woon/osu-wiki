If you're not familiar with things, the Mappers' Choice Awards (or *MCA*, as it is often known) is a community-hosted event where mappers nominate and vote on maps and mappers for various categories in order to celebrate mapping excellence in all shapes and forms.

As with last year, there are badges and osu!supporter prizes handed out to the winner of every category! If you'd like to learn more, check out the [Corsace website](https://corsace.io/) where you can find the results of previous iterations of MCA and learn more about these events!

On top of this, A Year In Mapping is sort of like a miniature version of *Spotify Wrapped*, but for beatmaps and mappers, showcasing a variety of neat statistics collated from across last year's maps, such as total number of guest difficulties, most maps ranked, most favourites and more. If this sort of thing interests you, read on!
