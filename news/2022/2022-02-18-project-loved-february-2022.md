Love is in the air, which means it's time for Project Loved to make a move!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)

Welcome back to another round of Project Loved! To those who need a reminder or are new here, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the Loved Captains of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the Project Loved forum [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so strike while the iron is hot and cast your votes on your favorite maps! You can read more about this project on the [wiki page](/wiki/Project_Loved)!

As is customary, we would like to sincerely thank everyone for your participation in the January round. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

This month, a lot has changed in the captain side of things for Project Loved. One of osu!mania's primary 7K captains, [Kawawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4647754), has decided to retire from their duties after almost an entire year of service. Joining the team in March of 2021, Kawawa has been responsible for nominating some of the most beloved osu!mania 7K maps to grace the category thus far. Alongside them, [DannyPX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11253722) is also resigning from the team due to personal reasons. We'd like to thank these two captains for their impactful, albeit short time with the team!

On top of these already very significant departures, one of the primary pioneers of osu!'s Project Loved scene and arguably one of the most influential players in the game to date, [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050) has also decided it is finally time for them to depart from Project Loved after 4 years of service. Joining the team back in 2018, Bubbleman has had a significant impact with a lot of absolute classics brought into the Loved section that many players continue to enjoy to this day. His contributions were no small feat and with one of the longest-standing members of Project Loved departing, we'd like to wish them the absolute best.

With the 7K side of things for osu!mania now needing new hands on-deck, Project Loved is welcoming a whopping 3 new captain additions to fill in the void left behind. Returning from their hiatus from the team is none other than the legendary [stupud man](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2141612). Alongside them we also have a fresh face joining the fray, being the one and only [-NoName-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10400730)! And as if that wasn't enough, [kadoen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12780575), known for being the person to contact when it comes to metadata for Project Loved, is also joining the roster of osu!mania captains alongside the other two! Please, give these fine folks a very warm welcome to the team!

Lastly, before we move onto this month's selection of beatmaps, we would like to remind you that if you want to submit maps to be considered for future votes, you may do so by filling out [this form](https://loved.sh/submit) and if you wish to view currently submitted maps, you can check them on the [Project Loved website](https://loved.sh/submissions).

Without any further delay, let's move onto this month's picks!

*description written by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

Deemed the "uncrowned king" of Aspire V, this map was designed to break the boundaries of everything we know about osu!, and boy did it surpass ANY expectations. This map stays true to what the Aspire contest was designed to bring out in the mapping community: no limits but the mind's creativity and the game's code.

Don't be deceived by the map's star rating — that's only the tip of the iceberg for the wizardry that was performed when this map was made. Despite its unfathomable star rating of 119, the map is designed in a way that plays at around the difficulty of a low 8-star tech map, just with some of the most creative expression the game has ever seen.

While the entry was just shy of winning any placements in the actual Aspire contest, we, like the rest of you who spoke out in the community, believe there should be justice for *Flashbacklog*.

*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

As an absolute beast of an aim control map, *Five Hammer - fffff* is 1 minute and 39 seconds of non-stop difficulty. With a star rating of 7.22 and BPM of 138, patterns of doubles, triples, linear aim, difficult snapping and even 1/6th streams, little can prepare you for this high-intensity piano adventure. With all of this and Luscent as a new face to the category as well in mind, I believe this map will find a wonderful home in the category.

Fit for many at slightly above 6 stars, this map utilizes classic tech elements like cut streams, frequently changing SV and many kicksliders. Play it now!!!!

At 9.22 stars, 240 BPM and 3.5 minutes of length, this map is packed to the brim with cross-screen jumps of all types, a test for those even with the greatest of aim. With apoq as another new face to Loved and this map's strong popularity, I hope to see it join the category soon!

Halgoh offers a unique take on the idea of "tech map", which always ends up being this super creative and well-polished masterpiece. This map is the perfect example of that. At 186 BPM and just under 7 stars, the map features the most beautiful mixture of different length bursts, cut streams, funky sliders, grass growing on the editor timeline — you name it, it's here, and it's done well. Topped off with a super high-energy song, this is a map that even the best tech players will find themselves coming back to again and again.

This rather simple set contains maps of all difficulties and is part of the same set as one of the osu!catch nominations. Featuring a rather classic osu! song, this mapset of *squartatrice* is bursty and jumpy, being slightly above 2 minutes at 180 BPM. You can enjoy this set no matter how long you've been playing the game for. :)

When we think of katacheh, insane gimmicks is the first thing that comes to our minds. *t+pazolite feat. Nanahira - Ukakuf Kins* doesn't fall short of what katacheh's trademark represents. However, this map will probably fry your eyes sooner than your computer.

An extreme low sv challenge, *Ukakuf Kins* has become a benchmark map in the community, and here at Taiko Loved Headquarters we are glad to propose this map for a more than deserving leaderboard to finally showcase the insane scores players have being setting during the past 2 years of this map's existence.

Legit scores, that is. If you haven't tried this map yet, you absolutely should! Millimetric reading required though, you have been warned.

*description written by [Boaz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13302996)*

*TremENDouS* is an outstanding map by \_Rise, namaniku and Shamirin_mzk featuring an amazing storyboard by Jerry. This map is extremely special due to it being a custom song by Camellia for the community-hosted Expert Global Taiko Showdown 2021.

A lot of time has been put into this project and that's why it at least deserves a Loved nomination even though it's fairly new. Besides the fact that this map is a big tribute to a very succesful tournament, it is also a massive challenge for higher-ranked players. *TremENDouS* is a *TremENDouSly* hard and intense map featuring excessively hard and fast patterns while also having very technical sections with lots of various snappings.

Lets see if someone can beat this *TremENDouS* map!

296.5 BPM, 4:46 | 8.38★\
*description written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

Camellia's take on *Invisible Frenzy* gave it a very familiar sound while keeping the soul of an absolute banger in this song, which was very accurately interpreted by KawaiiBass, with a mapping style that keeps to the very basics of patterns and a very mild sprinkle of SV usage to make a beatmap that's both easy to read and easy to hit, if only it wasn't for the 296.5 BPM of this song that is.

This makes it so it's not one of the hardest speed maps we've featured in Loved, but a very nice one to add due to its straightforward and outright fun mapping style, which is the reason why we believe KawaiiBass is becoming one of the best speed mappers out there. Please take a look at his work and enjoy!

The \[Oni\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [Horiiizon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8071438)*

*Playing with Ruby* is a classic jazz map that many of you will remember as the Group Stage tiebreaker in [TWC 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2021), although the infamous 10x slider velocity spinners don't pose the same threat of missing as they did under ScoreV2 in TWC, which is not to say that the map is easy!

Consisting of several different density snappings and unusual 1/6 patterning, despite this, *Playing with Ruby* is a very laid-back map due to the smooth slider velocities and jazzy piano throughout the map. This all comes together to make a more relaxing (yet still difficult) map than the typical fast-paced high-BPM maps Loved is known for while still retaining the quality!

We don't often feature maps with multiple rates as mania does but oh boy we just couldn't pass up on this one.

*Hejterdisskor* is a set with multiple sped-up difficulties, each one 20 BPM faster than the former and all of them have the same chart: the 7_7 special with very flowy improvisation sections with very well done deathstreams that become very brutal at the later difficulties. All of this makes up for one of the most fun and difficult maps to benchmark your skill level and see how fast you can stream, so have fun!

Most of you will already know this song (and maybe even the mapset as well) as there is already a ranked version of this, except that one is a marathon map. This spread however, has a length of 1:50 and the last difficulty of this is only slightly lower than the ranked version! Not only does this set have 2 Deluges and 2 Overdoses, it also has a Salad, Platter and a Rain difficulty! Whether you are a newer player or a more experienced player, this mapset has it all!

Oh there is only one exception: if you are a spinner player I have some bad news for you — only the Platter difficulty has a spinner so you might have to look elsewhere if that is your thing.

Each and every difficulty of this mapset is beautifully done, showing off all sorts of patterns from the old school CLSW streams to zig zags to tap dashing — you name it. The fact that most difficulties are made by a different mapper gives all of them a nice personal touch and unique interpretation.

This all-mode mapset hosted by Ujimatsu Chiya was sadly never finished and has been existing in graveyard for a long time now. It has some really nice catch diffs though which should receive more attention.

Sadly, the catch spread was never finished, but what we have are two really good high-end difficulties by none other than the infamous Minato Yukina as well as a clean Platter by Xetopia, who is known for making enjoyable lower difficulties.

The highest difficulty is quite the challenge, because it requires really good control to be able to deal with the a little bit unconventional patterns, as well as to keep up with the speed of the map. If you are struggling a lot on it, playing the other Overdose is recommended, which is significantly easier to play but also a really good map. Make sure to check it out!

As the [seventh edition of AxS](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1474871) is coming to a close, we decided it might be time for a nice little throwback to the Grand Final tiebreaker from two years ago... So here it is! I am fairly sure that everyone is on board on Minato Yukina, you know, *the* Minato Yukina. So I won't spend a paragraph explaining who they are.

What I do want to stress is the awesomeness of this map: it really has it all for top-end players. Fairly experimental patterns, streams, jumps, tap-dashes — you name it! I mean, it was a tiebreaker for the Grand Final's for pete's sake, and tiebreakers haven't really gotten harder in difficulty since, as this was the time where even top-end players started to criticize end-game mappools for their difficulty. Mods are definitely not recommended for this onel — I am afraid that my computer would fry were I to even try to apply Hard Rock to this.

But despite all this, this is a banger of a map. And I am telling you this as a rank 300 (how low I have sunk *cries*). Mix the artsy mapping with this amazing song and you have a wonderful end result, so let *havox* reign and check it out if you are not afraid to break a finger or two!

As a top player, thx for carry (well-known as MrBinking and Fli as well) knows how to make the patterns satisfying and exciting to play, and *La Mama de la Mama* is the map that proves the aforementioned strength of him as a mapper. Following the addictive vocals, brutal yet thrilling screen jumps consist most of the highlight of the song.

*description written by [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063)*

It is undeniable that NikoSek's influence in the realm of jumpstreams is wide and vast. Let it be for their infamy, the incredibly big amount of players that genuinely enjoy their charts, the song choice, or the vast spectrum of players it caters to with its plenty o' difficulties — perhaps he's the backbone of Latin South American mapping after all! No matter the reason, Helblinde's *Holding out for a Hero* is sure to be one of their most popular jumsptream charts thus far.

The map itself ranges from an accuracy test to a stamina gauntlet. The good thing is that this categorization is completely subjective to the player's skill! Maybe you simply want to test your raw physicality or reading on higher rates, or search for a more lax experience trying to get the most out of the lower difficulties.

No matter why this specific map has taken a fancy in you, either because you wish to test yourself or you ended up watching *Footloose* for some unforsaken reason and got reminded of this song, you are sure to enjoy it and dynamically adapt to its wide range of difficulties as you end up improving, little by little, rate by rate.

They say that love tastes sweet, yet with a bitter aftertaste \[*citation needed*\]. This SV map however proves itself to be fairly light, yet not quite straightforward either. Maybe that's how teenage love is nowadays. Not that I would know anyway.

We finally get to zero2snow's SV backlog, and *Love Taste* is one among many of his other notable tournament contributions. As his very first Loved nomination, *Love Taste* is a perfectly good introduction to SV memorization if you are looking to get into the skillset. If you find yourself hungry for more, there's a variety of other maps you can try: MWC-featured [*Hyou Ryuu*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/980182), tight banger and qualifier [*Forsaken*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1037446) or tougher entry [*easymotion*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/948786). Don't play [*Strange Inventor*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1130028).

Whether you enjoy SV or just vibe to Moe Shop (or both), you can allow this map to get the taste of the Loved section now by casting your vote!

A truly unforgiving stamina challenge, ever so slightly unique for its unorthodox use of very straining layering to ensure that you, the player, will be begging for this fascinating and thrilling torture of a map to stop. Do you want to test your arms before packing up to the gym? We then suggest you try challenging yourself with the higher rates. As a safety measure however, do keep a couple of ice cubes prepped for your wrists. Oh and have some health insurance so the ambulance costs are covered if needed. Better safe than sorry, *and trust me, this advice comes from from experience*.

*description written by [-NoName-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10400730)*

HowToPlayLN is back with one of the most popular tournament LN maps. At the time of writing, charts in this set of *#be_fortunate* have been used in no less than **nine** tournaments!

When it comes to 4K inverse LN charts, the #be_columnlocked difficulty is as straightforward as it gets. However, it is worth mentioning that due to a recent update to ScoreV2 in osu!mania, the difficulty name is a bit of a misnomer now, as it is harder to columnlock than it was before. I definitely recommend you try it on ScoreV2 sometime!

If you find that the #be_columnlocked difficulty is a little too hard, there is also the #be_nerfed difficulty. While it is still LN-heavy, it relaxes on the density and the inverse patterns somewhat, making it a more approachable difficulty compared to the former.

It is about time that this set has a chance to be in the Loved category, so be sure to cast your vote on *#be_fortunate*.

*She is Extraterrestrial Life* is here to throw it back for everyone.

stankill, whether you're a new or old player, is somebody who I'm sure most of you are well-aware of, if not only for their absolutely infamous set for [slavik goblins](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/322331). Back during the time that *She is ET Life* was made though, stankill proved to hold some significance in the osu!mania community with their tendency to chart harsh patterns, chaotic songs, and taking said charts to lengths that not many were willing to go back in early 2015. Let's talk about the map we have for you here today though.

As I said, back in 2015 there were not many maps in mania (for 4K especially), that were pushing the best players at the time to their limits. Most of what we had in that department were converts, so it's easy to see in retrospect why a chart like *She is Extraterrestrial* garnered the competitive spirit of many players in the community.

At just under 5 minutes, this map manages to put you through a fairly diverse series of patterns, a good number of which are stamina-intensive in nature. Chordjack walls, handstreams, and of course a plethora of jumptrills are mainly what you'll be seeing here, all backed by a noisy and aggressive song made by the legendary DJKurara, who most of you probably know for making *Japanese Transformation*.

Needless to say, this map is very straightforward, but a good representation of the time it was made in, and all of the Loved Captains here believe charts like this are an incredibly important piece of this mode's history. Many thanks to stankill for the content they put together during those early years, and I definitely hope everyone these days can see the appreciation that long-standing community members like myself have for charts like this.

arpia97 isn't only known for [vibro prowess](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/724338), he is also quite known for some of his hybrid, tournament compatible maps! *Carry Me Away* is one of his most notable ones among several, composed and produced by hi-tech legend lapix.

While this is a map suitable and enjoyable by intermediate- to high-level tournament players, arpia does get a bit... carried away at times. You might want to look out for a very infamous left-handed quadruple 175-BPM-long jack in there. Of course, this is far from the only tricks this short but intense map has up its sleeves, as it shows itself to be very all-rounded between LN coordination and releases, as well as stream and jack bursts and overall technicality.

You too can answer this map's plea to get carried away by casting your vote now!

It's definitely been a while since Vortex- stepped into the Loved scene again. Despite that, they're coming in strong with yet another very fun tech pick that they pulled out of their sleeves! Vortex-'s way of charting, as said by many, could be considered unique, even being someone admired by some people who took their style as a reference of their own. Therefore, we'd want to extend his legacy and impact in the community by offering everyone a chance to try out *96-glass' Blessed*!

This map is relentless. Its tech approach closely resembles the music its being accompanied by, almost achieving the same psychedelic effect on the player even. Can't ever be too safe! You think you've done very well on a section? Just be wary about the surprises you'll be able to find inside this Pandora's Box. Who knows, you might even find yourself with a (*spoiler alert*) 3-note-long jackhammer on your way to full clearing it.

Definitely, this is a map worth giving a shot. It's fun, varied, and hectic! Not for the faint of heart, but who knows, maybe it might pump you up as much as it has done so to us.

*description written by [Penguinosity](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10235296)*

riktoi makes a return to Loved, with their chordjack chart of Yoomiii's *Rhythm of Love*!

A bit of preface to anybody who may be confused, this set actually had a mirror upload to the site that was recently taken down with much more significant stats on it. We've taken that into account with this nomination. Onto the map.

*Rhythm of Love* is an ergonomic and forthright jack map, that should be approachable to all players of skill. While it was uploaded a few years ago to osu!, you can also find this map in the Etterna pack [*Nuclear Kimchi Chordjack Pack*](https://etternaonline.com/pack/56153), where it's garnered well over a thousand scores over the years.

Now although this chart is straightforward, I will point out that particularly on higher rates, the minijacks that are introduced during the second halves of the choruses can be very difficult to manage, and it definitely leads to some variation in how consistent you can be when going for scores. I feel that level of variance is something to definitely be appreciated, as you get an extra dynamic for what would otherwise be a very one-and-done sort of playthrough.

riktoi is certainly someone who I would say is more than capable of creating maps with the sort of dynamic that I described, as over the years they have put together a great number of maps that are diverse from one another, as well as diverse in their own contexts. I'd encourage anybody who hasn't before to check out the other charts riktoi has uploaded to osu!, as well as the works they've provided to other rhythm games. Big thanks for all the hard work they've done over the years to create enjoyable maps, and we hope for many more to come!

This is certainly going to be the most French Loved nomination that will ever exist. From veteran rhythm game players, cycling enthusiast and Pokimane fanboy Todestrieb (4K) and Elementaires (7K) respectively, we bring you the all-time go-to LN inverse introduction: *<3*!

Another convincing tune from French artist Moe Shop, being featured *a second time* in this month's osu!mania entries with zero2snow's *Love Taste*. This nomination also wouldn't be complete without the *appropriate* captain writing the description.

Both 4K and 7K difficulties have been noticed and included in LN dan courses, which is how a lot of this mapset's popularity came to fruition. While short and sweet, basic yet effective, a certain amount of mastery is required to get full accuracy and ratio on the long note releases, which is where leaderboard competitors will really be able to shine.

Whether you pronounce the song title as "heart" or "less than three" doesn't really matter. You know what you have to do to, ahem: *<3* this mapset. *Aux urnes, citoyens !*

qodtjr is making a return to the Loved section with what are arguably some of the hardest chordstream maps we've introduced yet!

We all know qodtjr for their plethora of chordstream content to make its way across the osu!mania 7K scene, and *SSjoy Dan* is no exception. Whether it's the incredibly dense climaxes of *Fastest Crash* or *ANOMALY*, or the consistent fast chordstreams in *Longinus*, every map in this pack brings a unique chordstream experience to the table. While being very difficult at varying BPMs and densities, the patterning still manages to be very straightforward and approachable if you're one of the few who are able to keep up.

If you're a 7K player looking to push your way through some incredibly tough chordstream maps, or a top player looking to push your limits, be sure to cast your vote on *SSjoy Dan*!

Hoto Cocoa (formerly Lude), Reba, and Wonki, all Loved veterans, are returning to the category with *Chambarising*!

It's not often we get to see a mapset shared between multiple titans in the 7K mapping scene, not to mention on a quite popular osu!mania song! While each difficulty in this set uses similar types of patterns (chordstreams, minijacks, and occasional long note usage), the style and density of the patterns is what sets each difficulty apart from one another. Just make sure to watch out for the SVs! Don't worry, they're very intuitive.

Many 7K players are sure to enjoy this mapset especially at the difficulty range it covers. Be sure to cast your vote and show your support for these mappers!

kasumi99 is quite a prolific mapper, with more than 100 maps under their belt — as a first entry of theirs into Loved we're bringing to you *Protoflicker*.

This is one of their most popular maps, a rice-focused chordstream affair at an approachable 140 BPM. The first half includes sparse chords and light streams, while the second half becomes denser with more frequent and heavy chords, all in all very consistent patterning. The map (like most of kasumi's maps) includes rates up to 1.4x (196 BPM) if you want to challenge yourself at higher speeds.

After trying it out, I recommend you explore some more of kasumi's maps, as they are well worth it. Some personal recommendations are [*Influencer*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1403266#mania/2894515) for BMS-style brackets or [*Da Xi*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1430427#mania/2944670) for a more LN-focused experience.

Flexo123 returns to the Loved voting stage with a map of *w/WWW feat. Hoshimiya Toto* which was very recently used as a long note pick in the Semifinals of [7K MWC 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_7K)!

There are two difficulties in this set. For those who like SVs, there are some basic SVs as well as a funny septuplet-mashing section. For those who don't, there is a non-SV difficulty that substitutes the septuplet-mashing for some more dense LN chords instead.

This set will test your LN chordstreaming abilities. It does become more tricky towards the end of the map (especially with the heavier bracketing), so be careful and don't get too lost.

Welcome emO_Oticon to the Loved voting! This set serves as his great debut to the Loved section.

emO_Oticon's set of *Hana ni Bourei* has both a 4K and a 7K difficulty to suit players of various keymodes. Both difficulties generously use "dumped" LNs for vocals as well as other instruments, with LN chordstreams and bursts. Be warned as the difficulty (particularly in the 7K) ramps up with denser and more complex LN patterning as the map goes on, especially around the guitar solos. Don't get caught by surprise.

Please vote and give emO_Oticon your support!

From everyone on the [Project Loved Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Project_Loved_Team), we hope you enjoyed this month's selections and are looking forward to the next! The favoured beatmaps will hit the [Loved beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved) shortly after the polls end.
