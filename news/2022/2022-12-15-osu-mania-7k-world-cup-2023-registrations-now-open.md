Happy holidays! We're back with another year of tournament excitement, and to kick things off we're bringing you the gift of... 7 keys! The osu!mania 7K World Cup 2023 is now open for registrations!

![](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_7K/img/mwc7k-2023-banner.jpg)

Following the trend set by this year's osu! World Cup, we are utilising an **[Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/osu-tournaments/events/osu-mania-7k-world-cup-2023-502fec83)** to allow for community donations which will directly increase the prize pool for the top 3 teams!

If you're unfamiliar with Open Collective, it is a platform that allows us to coordinate the finances of the World Cups in a transparent way, and also allows users to help support the tournament in greater amounts outside of purchasing profile banners or subscribing to the osu!live Twitch channel. You can do any one (or all) of these things if you want, they'll all still go towards the tournament!

You can donate directly to the prize pool of the upcoming World Cup of your choosing in a lump sum with or without an Open Collective account, and you can even leave a little message of support that will be displayed beneath your contribution, if you like.

*Please note that any "tips" made during the payment process go to Open Collective and not to us!*

For more details, refer to the **[osu!mania 7K World Cup 2023 wiki article](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_7K)**. You can discuss this event in the **[official discussion thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1690687)** or at the public **[community server](https://discord.gg/0Vxo9AsejDkGlk3H)**.

## How do I register?

- **[Click here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/36)**
- Teams will be formed by each country's captain *after* the registration phase has concluded.
- **The deadline for registering is December 29, 23:59 UTC. Make sure to get yours in before then!**

*Notice: you may only participate if your position in the osu!mania 7K global ranking is #5000 or higher, and you have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months.*

If your registration passes our internal checks, you will be placed on the candidate list for your country. When that country's captain has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

*Remember that any registrations submitted after the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances — submit your registration ahead of time to avoid any last-minute headaches. If you run into any issues, send an email to [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto:tournaments@ppy.sh).*
