Originality is the most highly valued commodity in the mapping world, and our newest Featured Artist **Ekcle** is here to provide it.

**Ekcle** was a two-man electronic unit focused on experimenting with the outer ranges of drum & bass, neurofunk, melodic dubstep, and much stuff we can't reasonably describe. Despite halting production in 2021, their discography offers some of the most progressive sounds you'll ever hear.

Stop reading and start mapping any of the **7** awe-inspiring songs available from [**Ekcle**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/326).
