We're proud to bring legendary artist **Crywolf** into our Featured Artist lineup!

Anyone who's searched for jump maps has likely come across **Crywolf** — specifically the classic Loved map [Eyes Half Closed](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/385088) by [Truzon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6347812). This tune is just one of **Crywolf**'s many emotion-packed tracks, showcasing both the chill ambient and stirring electronic sides of his style.

**6** of these one-of-a-kind projects can be mapped from [**Crywolf**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/321)!

This is one of those cases where the music speaks for itself. In case you're one of the three osu! players who still hasn't come across *Eyes Half Closed*, prepare for the best 2 minutes of your life before clicking on the video below, then check out everything else that's on the table:

Design your own masterpiece with any of the pre-timed beatmap templates on [**Crywolf**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/321). (Even if you don't know how to map, any semblance of a beatmap with one of **Crywolf**'s songs is automatically a masterpiece.)

Believe it or not, osu! is a rhythm game. Our next Featured Artist comes straight out of the rhythm game music production world, so look towards the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) next Wednesday if that's your thing.

Stay tuned!
