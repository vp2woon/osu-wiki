**Mili** is here.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/331/header.jpg)

Do we really need to say more?

**Mili** is the band behind [world.execute\(me\);](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/470977), one of osu!'s coolest storyboards, and an endless slew of maps using songs from *Cytus* and *Deemo* like [Utopiosphere](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/187177), [Nine Point Eight](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/310702), and [Fable](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/217722).

And now they're one of osu!'s Featured Artists.

We've selected **30** tracks from **Mili**'s discography for all of osu!'s mappers to explore. Pick and choose your favourites from [**Mili**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/331)!

We're done talking. Witness the storyboard that earned [Exile-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2559349) his *Elite Storyboader* title, then play through a bunch of maps using **Mili**'s songs that are officially part of our Featured Artist library:

Aaaaaaaand that's a wrap for 2022's Featured Artists!

We've added more than **100 artists** to our [Featured Artist collection](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) this year, bringing our total licensed track count to over **8,000 songs**. We're not *really* counting, but we're probably host to one of the largest (if not *the* largest) collections of licensed rhythm gaming music on the planet by now... or we're getting close. Either way!

Yet more still is on the horizon for 2023, so prepare yourself for a whole new year of additions to our Featured Artist catalogue, and perhaps some fresh ways of presenting new artists going forward.

As always, stay tuned. :)
