**USAO** IS HERE.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/248/header.jpg)

**USAO** is the webbing that connects every rhythm game together. A whole **18** music games (including osu! as of today) have officially adopted **USAO**'s sound, including major players like *WACCA*, *Dance Dance Revolution*, *beatmaniaIIDX*, and MANY more.

We've managed to pick up a steaming collection of **25** tracks for [**USAO**'s Featured Artist library](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/248)! While many of **USAO**'s iconic tunes are exclusively made for rhythm games, we still grabbed hold of tracks that are iconic on osu! like [Showdown](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/438839) and [Extra Mode](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/579451), both with ~1 million plays each!

There's a lot of **USAO** to consume. Check out some of the existing maps for these masterpieces below:
