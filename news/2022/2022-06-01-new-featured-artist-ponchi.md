**Ponchi** slides into our Featured Artist collection!

If you've been following our Featured Artists for the last few months, you're already well aware of this artist's talent.

Alongside [MisomyL](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/243), **Ponchi** is one of the names behind [MisoilePunch](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/239), whose music has been featured in countless games like *Dynamix*, *Cytus II*, and *SOUND VOLTEX*! **Ponchi**'s personal works maintain a high-energy rhythm game style with a cute twist enhanced by vocalist *haxchi*'s anime-esque performances.

**7** of these juicy tracks are ripe for the picking from [**Ponchi**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/271)!

Haven't heard **Ponchi**'s sound yet? Now's the perfect time to start. Serenade your ears with this video highlighting two of **Ponchi**'s slow and fast songs while also featuring osu!(lazer)'s new editor metronome.

Oh, and once you're done, check out everything else too:
