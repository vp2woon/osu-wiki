Due to popular demand, the [Performance Points Committee](/wiki/People/Performance_Points_Committee) (and associates) have decided to host a series of community meetings to address any questions or concerns you may have about the latest developments surrounding performance points and star rating!

Here's a brief rundown on how the community meetings will work:

- There will be a Q&A panel for each of the osu! game modes, lasting 1–1.5 hours each.
- These panels will be hosted on the [official osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) through a Discord stage channel.
- During each panel, audience members can raise their hand to be invited onto the stage to ask their question. Audience members can also type their questions in the relevant thread, or pre-submit their questions [here](https://forms.gle/Q3YSYZF5ZCEuqXtZ7) if they cannot attend.

Below is the schedule for the community meetings. You can tune in live through the Discord stage channel, and we'll update this news post with links to the talks should they be recorded or streamed for those who can't make it.

We look forward to seeing you there! Remember to use the [question submission form](https://forms.gle/Q3YSYZF5ZCEuqXtZ7) if you have an important question you'd like to ask about future development, but won't be able to make it there in person (or if you just don't want to put your hand up and speak). Be sure to spread the word to anyone you think might be interested!

See you all soon!
