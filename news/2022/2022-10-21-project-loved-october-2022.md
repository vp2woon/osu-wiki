Check out some spooky Loved picks and cast your votes on this month's selection!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

To those who're still unfamiliar with what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved Captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll, or you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As always, we would like to thank everyone for your participation in the September votes. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

We have yet another stream benchmark for players to test their stamina and finger control abilities.

This set of *Midorigo Queen Bee* by our much loved new Featured Artist [-45](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/297) is a multi-rate mapset by [Kastellan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4973617). This map is an absolute stamina gauntlet, with bursts, deathstreams, and doubles to really get your fingers moving. Many players will tell you this mapset is perfect for warming up, training, and benchmarking your stamina. With the massive 250,000+ plays and 100+ favorites accumulated on this mapset, there is no doubt it's a community favorite.

Vote for this map, and if it's loved you'll get to see how well your tapping matches up to everyone else in the world.

*description written by [Skill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7802027)*

[Sytho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4175698) always finds a way to make a map as fun as the song.

This aim map fiesta of Eric Saade's *Popular* is one of the best combinations of being a fun & banger map to test your jump skills to the limit. This mapset includes a wide range of difficulties for different skill levels, ranging from a 9.28\* 250 BPM cross-screen top diff for aim gods to a 2.23\* for newer players. Nobody is missing out from this mapset.

The 300,000+ plays, nearly 300 favorites and many notable players pushing the game's limits on the map should give a clear indicator that this map is becoming iconic and loved by many. Give it your honest vote, and if it makes it to Loved, you can either watch the fierce competition between the best of the best or simply try it to test your mechanics at a difficulty level appropriate for your skill level.

This next map is one of the most well-known and beloved maps from the [osu! World Cup 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2021)!

[Nathan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4785223)'s rendition of this extremely upbeat (and at times confusing) song has become a staple among top players and tournament mappools looking to test unique skillsets ever since its debut as a custom-made beatmap for the OWC Grand Finals last year.

If you are looking to test the absolute limit of your unconventional aim and tapping skills, looking for a beatmap with many different tempos and mapping styles, or just want a really catchy tune to jam out to, then make sure drop this a vote for the Loved section!

*Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only...*

With a recent uptick of maps higher than 10\* in difficulty in the Ranked section, I believe it is time to bring some of the playable endgame-like maps to the Loved section as well. One of the most known of these is RoughSketch's *777*, mapped by [FriendoFox](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3678808). The beatmap, at a seemingly absurd star rating of 10.24, has become a staple in top players' livestreams since [Vaxei showcased how possible a good play on the map was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsgWOj1p5NQ). You can expect 777 BPM wiggles, finger control madness, and absurdly fast sliders that will scare even the best of the best players. But don't fret, as there is a lower, more playable, 7.77\* (obviously) difficulty that focuses more on flow aim, although it still is a challenge in and of itself.

If you wanted a sequel to the likes of [Big Money](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/293705#osu/660593), this might be what you're looking for, so make sure you vote it for Loved! And if you're willing to check this map out by playing it, all I can say is... good luck, you'll need it.

*description written by [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)*

[antiPLUR](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/24), one of osu!'s featured artists, got their first appearance on the scene with [ktgster](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/53378)'s map of a sped-up version of [Speed of Link](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/359173#osu/789765), which catapulted the song and artist into popularity. However, not everyone can play at the speed of light, so [Linada](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5239047) stepped up to bring us a more traditionally mapped version of the full, original song. That doesn't mean in the slightest that it's going to be a walk in the park, though. Be ready for three minutes of non-stop 240 BPM and 260 BPM streaming, if your fingers can handle it.

The beat don't stop, indeed — since 2017, the map has gathered almost a hundred favourites and over 60,000 plays, mostly from players looking to warm up or test their stamina. So, if you want to check this map out, be fast, and make sure you give it an honest vote for Loved!

*description written by [rHO](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1629553)*

K-pop and "tech" mapping isn't really a familiar combo to most people, but [emilia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2003326) succeeds in combining both elegantly in this underrated map.

Emilia simply does not miss when it comes to pacing, patterning, and slider usage. Don't let the song being 103 BPM fool you, as it is filled with plenty of aggressive sliders, jumps, and bursts that make an energetic combo throughout the 3 minutes of the song. Watch out for the secret swans among the sliders, too!

This map has been a treat for me to play, and I hope you can enjoy it the same way as I do.

Hmmmm.... can sliders even do this???

This next map is a showcase of the absolute mastery that [ScubDomino](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8972308) has over the editor with weird and wonderful themes!

Scubdomino's revolutionary map of [False Noise - Hyperlight](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1799396#osu/3688729) uses the (relatively new) [sliderator](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/940368?n=1) gimmick of accelerating sliders in ways that have never been seen before, in such a way that feels like every complex wub and growl sound throughout the song is being represented perfectly — truly an experience for both mappers and players alike!

This map was also custom-made for the [Charlie's Perfect Math Class](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1570901?n=1) tournament, and as a consequence is surprisingly balanced around the concept it uses. While this map may appear daunting with the first few plays, it really shines by being fair and consistent with its gimmick usage, so if you are a fan of learning wacky maps and gimmicks, this should be right up your alley!

With the recent news regarding accelerating sliders having been deemed unrankable, this map is a perfect fit for the Loved category.

[tokiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2836455) is here to judge your streaming skills, and their gavel is this hugely popular stream map from 2017!

A spicier take on an [even older sjoy set](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/210764#osu/495776), this one assaults you with relentless 195 BPM bursts and streams that will push you. This isn't just a one-trick stream set though — it will test a multitude of your skills. It constantly mixes things up with kicksliders, aim sections, and plenty of cutstreams too, always with something new to show you. Oh, and do not underestimate that ending. For me, the 5-minute length goes by in a flash, and judging by the amount of favourites it has, I'm not the only one!

You are the jury in this case. Discuss your verdict, and make your decision on the fate of this map in the link above!

I don't think words can do justice just how crazy this map is, so [let these top players show you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyG1XcG5qo4).

Opening up this round of loved maps, we're putting up *Slax - Lunaticon*, a long-awaited favorite that amassed a high popularity in such a short time frame due to the map being incredibly smooth and fun to play!

Consisting mainly of comfortable, high-density patterns and long streams in the kiai's, this makes up for a perfect map for those who are getting into stamina Inner Oni maps, but if you're up to it you can try out the sped-up diffs for a harder challenge!

Have fun!

Many tournament players will probably know the infamous *Good L_ck (Yo_'re F_cked)* mapped by [Greenshell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8693851). This map has been an evil anti-mod pick in tournaments for a few years now and it's easy to see why it's so popular in the Free Mod slot. This map features lots of different slider velocity changes throughout the map. The kiais have various but overall very high slider velocities, making it hard to read for Double Time and Hard Rock. On the flip side, the other parts of the map usually have very low slider velocity making it hard to read for Hidden. It's safe to say this map is one hell of a ride for any mod.

Are you ready to challenge this map as a Hard Rock demon or Hidden monster? Perhaps we'll even see some HDHR and Double Time scores!

Good L_ck!

After a wave of complex and challenging maps in the past Loved selections, it is time for at least one map to be friendly to all kinds of audiences. *Marshall Maximizer* by [\_Rise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5217107) is a fairly simple and consistent map, with engaging patterning to fit a really popular song. Due to its simplicity, it's an approachable map, hence its' high popularity and play count, leading it to be one of this month's selections. You don't have to be an absolute drum master to enjoy this map nor do you have to be a beginner either, so you should absolutely try this map out!

The map features a light variety of snappings, using some 1/6 quads and doubles but in a way that is simple to understand while still being very fun to play, no matter the skill level!

This month we have a newcomer to the Loved category, [-Vale](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7075339)! While this isn't the most challenging map for everyone this Loved rotation, I'm sure there's a bunch of players that will find enjoyment out of this map.

With a banger of a song, the map filled with streams, some longer sliders here and there and the overall clean mapping style, you're sure to have a blast playing through the map.

Think the map is too easy for you? Try chucking on Hardrock and see if you can back up your claim! With a circle size of 4.5 (and almost 6 with Hardrock enabled) it will give you a run for your money!

Here we go again. Do you remember [Soulless 4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/772138#fruits/1623653), that one menacing map by [Kyptoric](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1361268) that has only a single FC despite being Loved for years already? This is pretty much its younger brother. In terms of patterns and overall feel of the map *Soulless 3* is very similar to *Soulless 4*, so if you know about *Soulless 4* you know what to expect from this one. The major difference though is that *Soulless 3* is less than half the length of *Soulless 4* which will probably make it more doable than its predecessor. But even then, this is a ridiculous challenge for just about anyone.

*description written by [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)*

[Saikai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8172283) is known for being an insane player who is currently top 10 on the global leaderboards, but apart from all the impressive scores they set regularly, they also do map quite a lot.

One of those maps is *AO-Infinity*, which is overall a clean map with some unconventional patterning here and there. A major part of this map are stream patterns with lots of hyperdashes, but there are also some parts that may throw you off, especially the middle section of the map since it contains some uncommon hyperdashes paired with fast-paced patterns. The most difficult section though is near the end of the map, where the stream patterns get noticeably more difficult and also contain quite the amount of fast wiggles in between. If you are not careful enough, a slip-up may end the run there.

Overall a map of moderate difficulty that can be enjoyed by a lot of people so make sure to check it out!

......... huh- OH HEY THERE LOVELY READER! You scared me there! What was I doing? Well, you know, there is this map called *Zzz* by [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598), and it's like the most soothing thing ever! It has a couple of difficulties which are very relaxing, and playable by virtually anyone. As a matter of fact, I believe it might be quite a good pick for loved, considering the amount of times it has been played since its creation over eight years ago — it even saw some play in tournaments!

So let me see, I will just put it up for loved like this... and now people can vote for it! But, before you do, let me take you for a spin! Here, let me just turn on Score V2 and we're off to- to... to the... what was I saying agai- *yawn* .........

[sabi - true DJ MAG top ranker's song Zenpen (katagiri Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1569250#mania) by [Ciel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1455309)\

Remember [lost found melody](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1051052)? [Shakunetsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/853414)? Well, [Ciel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1455309) is back for more with *true DJ MAG*!

As someone who has been involved with SV pooling for MWC 2021, I deeply recall the crunch week we spent on trying to deliver this map for the Finals mappool. Yes, this was indeed supposed to be the memorization-oriented SV entry for MWC 2021, but it was just way too hard and unfair for that competitive setting in particular!

As such, you can find 2 sets of difficulties in this mapset: "top=false" features nerfed rice patterns that have been iterated during MWC 2021 pooling in order to try and make the pick more approachable compared to [Mafain](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1569493), which was the other SV pick for that stage; "top=true" on the other hand features the unnerfed version, true to Ciel's vision and direction for this map. Both versions however feature the same, unforgiving, brutal SV gimmicks that one has come to expect from Ciel over the years.

The barrier of entry to even try and grasp this map is incredibly high: this challenge and this leaderboard is reserved only for the cream of the crop, the best of the best of this community. If you want to make a name for yourself and think you're capable of catching a spot among the best SV players in the world, this might be the map you're looking for. Good luck on learning, have fun grinding.

Are you looking for the worst map in osu!mania? Well, this is not it: this is just *The Worst*, brought to us by [Cokii-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6760124)!

Polyphia is a band that has been on the rise, renowned and recognizable thanks to many *Clone Hero* custom charts. They even paid tribute to them by [incorporating a custom chart using the game in their recent clip of *ABC*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtd24QIBJ5Y&t=111s), which I thought was pretty cool and neat. This is one of the many reasons why I'm pretty excited to see more and more of their songs getting mapped on osu!mania. Yes, please map more Polyphia, I'm begging you.

*The Worst* takes a liberal, dumpy approach to song representation: the various guitar licks and riffs are transcribed through bursts and strokes of calculated, technical rice. Despite this technicality, this map actually flows well enough to appeal to players looking for speed-oriented content. Moreover, the provided rates, in optional combination with DT or NC mods, allow players of all levels to try and find their sweet spot — at the original speed, the map is quite affordable, with a star rating of less than 4.

Sorry we couldn't provide you with the best for this month, just feel free to vote for *The Worst* in the attached thread!

[Kobaryo - Bookmaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1856758#mania) by [\[Crz\]Rachel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8369409)\

*description written by [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063)*

For those already aware, yes this is **The** Bookmaker. Finally making its way from [Rachel's Rabifiles 2](https://etternaonline.com/pack/82195) to here for everyone to enjoy! This is undeniably the most ~~in~~famous iteration of this song ever charted. Its legacy status even carried over to mania without ever having been uploaded by the original creator.

But what makes this chart so special? Well, if you're too afraid to try it out for yourself, a very rough description would be that [Rachel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8369409) made a speedjack chart out of chordjacks. It's very dense and daunting at first, until you realize that the chords have been cleverly placed to be as *""comfortable""* as possible.

Other than that, the rest is up to you, the player — to experience. Oh, and do be very careful with your wrists if you're not used to this kind of stuff. You'll thank me later.

*description written by [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063)*

Been a long while since [Elekton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4990211) was featured here. But they're coming in strong with Le Dos-on's *A*, a very well-known jumpstream chart featured two years ago in the [osu!mania 4K World Cup of 2020](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2020_4K).

So, who's ready to tackle this gargantuan 6-minute marathon? If you do, don't just lay back on your chair and play on autopilot as this won't be your run-of-the-mill jumpstream chart. Do expect trickier parts here and there, and your occasional bursts here and there. Even your occasional LNs can be found here and there such that some people will still manage to forget that releases are a thing! Other than that, all in all this will be a gauntlet for your stamina.

Give it a try, see how much it hurts. And if the base rate doesn't make the cut for you, try with the higher rates to see if you can still say the same!

[SUNMI - pporappippam](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1203619#mania) by [Lovelyn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8370443)\
120 BPM, 3:21 | 6.06★\
*description written by [-NoName-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10400730)*

[Lovelyn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8370443) is someone who gained a following from having simple LN maps charted to K-Pop music, and it is finally time for a nomination of one of his charts, *pporappippam*!

This chart is great for people who need to practice inverse. It has simplistic patterning as well as some vocal streams to switch things up. The BPM of 120 is also low enough that you can easily uprate it (even with DT) if you are looking to get at least some challenge out of this chart.

There is surely more to come from Lovelyn in the future of Loved nominations, and if you want to see more of this, don't forget to give Lovelyn your support!

[Reba](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3087654) is back for another run at Loved voting with *Yozakura*.

We don't often get to nominate maps that feature dense and fast streams in the 7K department, and *Yozakura* doesn't back down from their use. The prominent streams in this map clock in at around 270 BPM, so don't let the star rating (or the difficulty name) on this one fool you! For those who are interested, this was also featured in [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2018](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2018_7K).

If you're one of many to consider this mapset a classic, or just want to see more fun and challenging stream charts in Loved, be sure to cast your vote for *Yozakura*!

[Mage](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5527957) has not seen a Loved nomination since 2018, and it's time to hail his return to the voting stage with his chart of *99.9 / Eurobeat Remix*!

This chart has dense, but easy-to-hit chordstreams such that many players have found this pleasing to play. Eurobeat often provides good songs for charting chordstreams, and this is no exception. There is plenty of brackets and dense chording to keep you occupied — but if the BPM isn't enough for you, there are rates to satisfy the more experienced demographic.

Support Mage by giving this set your vote!

[ruka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6117525) returns to the Loved voting once again with his chart of *AliVe*!

This is a well-known, high-quality chart which maintained its popularity for the people capable of playing it. There are multiple distinct sections in the chart giving each part of the song a unique feel. The complex LN patterning becomes more difficult to play as players progress through the sections. While this chart may have quite an entry barrier, you will surely not be disappointed while playing through it.

If you want to see *AliVe* in the Loved section, remember to support ruka and cast your vote!
