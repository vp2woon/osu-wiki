The time has come to unveil the long-awaited results of our skinning contest the third!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-10-20-skinning-contest-chromatic-alteration-results/banner.jpg)

A whopping total of **12260** votes casted by **4784** unique voters have determined the outcome of the competition among the **23** works of art.

Without further ado, let's have a look at which entries made it to the podium:

## 3rd Place - sour_grapes

Attracting a total of **968** sour grape enjoyers, [sour_grapes](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1626950) by [koomo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2168518) achieves the 3rd place!

Adopting a protanopic palette, sour_grapes portrays a futuristic look with Ene from *Kagerou Project* on the side. Featuring matrix-esque panels and high-tech design from head to toe, the skin makes you feel like you're playing the game through a visor, while also not letting up on the minimalistic outlook.

Needless to say, if you're looking for a cutting-edge skin offering a *slow journey* into your osu! and osu!taiko ventures, sour_grapes is your go-to one!

Executing a masterpiece going all out on technological advancements, koomo gets to achieve the 3rd-place profile badge with their sour_grapes entry! Congratulations!

## 2nd Place - Ralsei Dark

Themed around objectively the cutest character in *Deltarune*, [Ralsei Dark](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1629393) was favoured by **1119** voters, allowing [Corne2Plum3](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15646039) to claim the 2nd place!

Featuring a tritanopic palette, Ralsei Dark brings about the artsy look of the well-renowned *toby fox* games perfectly integrated into your osu! client. Furthermore, despite going all out on textures and art plastered everywhere, the skin actually manages to balance it out masterfully through a rather minimalist outlook on gameplay and the results screen.

Well, it's a Ralsei-themed skin after all. Who wouldn't love it? Especially when all the artwork is created by the very hands of the skinner itself!

Thanks to their beloved work of art, Ralsei Dark, Corne2Plum3 is awarded with a cute Ralsei artwork immortalised in the form of a profile badge!

## Winner - 霜滅 SOUMETSU

With a grand total of **1497** votes, [霜滅 SOUMETSU](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1628514) enables [thetasigma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6234482), a veteran runner-up from the previous iteration, to finally reach for the crown!

Utilising a protanopic palette, 霜滅 SOUMETSU combines the charm of a typical minimalist skin and a popular *Genshin Impact* character, Kamisato Ayaka. From adorable artworks to meticulously designed assets, the skin sets up a perfect example for its kind. To look at it from a different perspective, the artworks portraying traditional Japanese way of life embedded within the modern, minimalist textures essentially signifies the harmony between the two distinct elements.

There is much to say for this lovely creation, yet words will not suffice. Check it out yourself to appreciate this work of art to the fullest, if you haven't already!

After falling short of the grand prize last edition, thetasigma finally outdid themselves, grabbing a hold of the badge certifying their accomplishment thanks to their entry, 霜滅 SOUMETSU. Congratulations thetasigma, well deserved!
