Vocalist **Annabel** serenades our Featured Artist library!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/234/header.jpg)

It's safe to bet that everyone reading this has heard **Annabel**'s soothing voice already.

She made her first major debut through singing the ending theme to "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai" in 2009, and her music has been a constant on osu! since as far back as 2011. Her solo works have just recently made their way to the forefront too, with maps like [glimmer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1525495) and [lilac slumber](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1569646) paving the way for many more beatmaps to come.

Those additional beatmaps will, of course, come straight from [**Annabel**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/234), where there's a whole **23** tracks up for the taking.

We know, we know. You're already in love with **Annabel**'s music. For good measure though, watch through this leaderboard-climbing video of [pedalnote](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1669381), then explore the rest of the beatmaps and previews below!

Just head to [**Annabel**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/234) already. We don't need to do any convincing for music as perfect as this.

What's that? Did you say you want *more* music? If **Annabel** isn't quite what you're looking for, we have yet another artist planned for this Saturday. Stay tuned for that and keep an eye on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for all the details.
