You might not recognize our latest Featured Artist by their name, but you *definitely* recognize **Rabbit House**'s beatmaps.

**Rabbit House**, also known as [Nakagawa-Kanon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/87065) or *dksslqj* on osu!, is best known among circle clickers for creating one of the game's most renowned beatmaps of all time: [xi - FREEDOM DiVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/39804).

Since that legendary beatmap was ranked a decade ago, **Rabbit House** has developed a musical skillset to match their rhythm game expertise. **Rabbit House**'s blood-pumping music recently made a splash in games like *Lanota* and *Arcaea*, and has finally come full-circle by returning officially to osu! as of today.

We have **23** tracks, all available on [**Rabbit House**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/242). And if that wasn't enough, one of them is being released exclusively on osu! too. Check them all out if you want to be a part of this beatmapper-turned-musician's story!

Considering **Rabbit House**'s beatmap of [xi - FREEDOM DiVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/39804) clocks in at 222.22 BPM, it's a shame we didn't publish [their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/242) a day earlier (on 2022-02-22). We understand how dissatisfying this is, but we hope the convenience of our pre-timed beatmap templates is enough reason for you to forgive us.

One more artist is scheduled for this week! The [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) might help you keep track all the talent we bring on board, so keep an eye out.

See you Saturday!
