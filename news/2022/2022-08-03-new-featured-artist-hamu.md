Experience a new world of emotive tracks with our latest Featured Artist, **Hamu!**

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/289/header.jpg)

Founder of the music label *Foxtail-Grass Studio*, you might already be familiar with some of [**Hamu**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/289)'s work if you're a fan of the Touhou Project and its sprawling catalogue of fan rearrangements. Beyond that, if you've ever watched a stream from the tremendously popular Virtual YouTuber talents of *Shirakami Fubuki*, *Sakura Miko* and *Minato Aqua* from *Hololive Production*, you've likely heard some of his BGM tracks before, not to mention his role as the producer for a few of the aforementioned's original songs.

With an expansive and emotive sound, we're absolutely confident that you'll love what **Hamu** has to offer, so we've partnered up to snag **16** new tracks across his entire range, from slow meandering through moonlit vistas to head-bopping, high-energy J-Pop that'll get stuck in your head for the rest of all eternity.

Thanks to the crowned creators of the [Mappers' Guild](https://mappersguild.com/), we're also excited to showcase an all-new beatmap to get things rolling, played by esteemed osu! veteran [Mlaw](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3126596) and corn connoisseur [Woey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3792472) IRL at COE2022:
