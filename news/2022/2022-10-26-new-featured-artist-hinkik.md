**Hinkik** leaps through time into our Featured Artist catalogue!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/315/header.jpg)

Half Japanese and half Swedish producer **Hinkik** describes his sound as having two distinct sides: atmospheric sections with melodic breakdowns, along with fiercely intense build-ups and drops. Contrasting both of these is what makes **Hinkik**'s style a perfect fit for mapping.

We've picked up **8** chunks of gold from **Hinkik**'s collection, so take your pick from what's available now on [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/315).

You know what might be convincing? Seeing some of **Hinkik**'s music in action. Take a peek at this brand new map of [Explorers](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1861042) (created specifically for this announcement!), then run through the rest of the previews:
