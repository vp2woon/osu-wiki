The story so far:

- [4 months ago](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-05-31-triangles), we announced [**triangles**](/wiki/Contests/triangles_Beatmapping_Contest) — a mapping and storyboarding contest centred around osu!(lazer)'s theme song *[cYsmix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/2) - triangles*.
- 2 months ago, panels of [experienced mappers](/wiki/Contests/triangles_Beatmapping_Contest#mapper-panel) and [experienced storyboarders](/wiki/Contests/triangles_Beatmapping_Contest#storyboarder-panel) put their lives on hold to determine who created the best beatmap.
- [Last month](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-09-08-triangles-voting-phase), we opened a community vote for *you* to pick out your favourite submission.

And now we're here.

## Results summary

### Storyboarders' pick

Let's kick things off with [**this submission**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1842041) by [Fisky](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8352623), [ScubDomino](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8972308), [fanzhen0019](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/418699), [Tommy Phelps](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10974581) and [VenerableNyanta](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12243368)! Despite earning #3 overall, this entry managed to win the **#1 spot in the storyboarding department!**

[![submission preview](/wiki/shared/news/2022-10-04-results-triangles/sbpreview.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1842041)

Combining the expertise of [Tommy Phelps](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10974581) and [VenerableNyanta](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12243368) (a.k.a. two of osu!'s most well-known storyboarders), it's no surprise that this team managed to win the hearts of the storyboarder panel.

However, it's definitely surprising to learn that they managed to create their winning storyboard *in less than a week*. When you're this skilled, anything is possible, right?

Of course, the best way to experience this storyboard is to [play the map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1842041) (which is awesome too, by the way).

Members of this team have earned themselves the **Storyboarders' Pick** profile badge for their work!

Along with this prize, the storyboarders of this team have earned themselves the **Elite Storyboarder** user title!

### Runner-up winner

Veteran winners from our previous team-based mapping contest [A Labour of Love](/wiki/Contests/A_Labour_of_Love_Contest) made a return this year with [**the most artsy submission around**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1841845)! Created by [Altai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5745865), [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334), [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515), [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323) and [TheDuckMask](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7405768), this submission came super close to the winning spot in all categories, ultimately making it the **overall runner-up** in the contest!

![Overall runner-up](/wiki/shared/news/2022-10-04-results-triangles/runnerup.jpg)

[![submission preview](/wiki/shared/news/2022-10-04-results-triangles/runneruppreview.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1841845)

Tackling the challenge of a <1MB storyboard led many teams to use minimalistic vector styles, but [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323) and [TheDuckMask](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7405768) took the challenge in a completely different direction — they drew a story uniting all of osu!'s mascots (including the new mascot *DJ peppy*), all with original artwork drawn by the two artists.

The map itself is on another level too! Quoting [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048) during the results stream, "you can *feel* DeviousPanda in this map", which can only be taken as a compliment. The map is outstandingly well designed and takes some experimental liberties throughout the whole mapset, lending to a fresh experience all around.

Everyone in this team has earned the **Overall runner-up** profile badge!

[![submission preview](/wiki/shared/news/2022-10-04-results-triangles/winnerpreview.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1841885)

Honestly, words don't do this justice. [Play the map yourself](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1841885) and soak in the storyboard to fully understand why it's the winner.

[Play it.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1841885)

[You won't regret it.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1841885)

[We promise.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1841885)

Each member of this team has earned the **Overall winner** profile badge, and its participants have earned **Elite Mapper** and **Elite Storyboarder** user titles accordingly!

We can't forget the grand prize of this contest: **the winning submission is bundled with all iterations of osu!(lazer) going forward**.

Once ranked, this beatmap will be one of the first things an osu! player sees in the new client! Given its sheer quality in every aspect, there's no better map for the role.

Major props to everyone involved in this future classic!

See the [contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/147) for more details on the community vote.

Judging for this contest involved some experimentation. Instead of assigning raw numbers to submissions like most contests, the judges were given two tasks:

1. Order the submissions from best to worst in their respective expertise (mapping or storyboarding).
2. Assign a limited supply of bonus points based on standard judging categories.
   - Mapping panel: technical skill, creativity, theme, outstanding Easy/Normal/Hard/Insane/Expert difficulty
   - Storyboarding panel: technical skill, creativity, theme, general storyboard impression

The first task earned a submission between 1 and 12 points (12 points for a judge's #1 map, 11 for #2, 10 for #3, etc.). Each bonus point added one additional point to the total. See the [judging compilation sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VwajV4Ibn-k_sNHiiPAXX0raXiX34-v7_6SBWUq2pPY/edit#gid=0) to see the full judging breakdown, including all map quality orderings, bonus point distributions, and judge comments!

## triangles playlist leaders

There's one more set of prizes to dish out today, but they're not for mappers or storyboarders!

To vote for this contest, we required the community to **play each of the submissions in osu!(lazer)** through one of the five difficulty-specific playlists (Easy/Normal/Hard/Insane/Expert).

As an added bonus, we also decided to reward the players at the top of each playlist with a month of osu!supporter, plus the **triangle aficionado profile badge** for the winner of the Expert playlist!

![triangle aficionado profile badge](/wiki/shared/news/2022-05-26-triangles/aficionado@2x.png)

Give some credit to these playlist leaders:

- Easy playlist: [-Matyr-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13771539)
- Normal playlist: [TheRealStevie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12153630)
- Hard playlist: [fieryrage](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3533958)
- Insane playlist: [fieryrage](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3533958)
- Expert playlist: [Intercambing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2546001)

## Conclusion

Massive thanks to everyone involved this contest — whether that be as a participant, a judge, a voter, or even someone who followed the contest 'til its end today!

Contests of this scope are always difficult to put together, but seeing the results from the community makes it entirely worth it.

We'll be hosting more team-based creative community contests like this in the future while taking into consideration the pros and cons seen throughout this contest (and [A Labour of Love](/wiki/Contests/A_Labour_of_Love_Contest) from last year).

Look forward to what's in store for osu!. :)

See you next time.
