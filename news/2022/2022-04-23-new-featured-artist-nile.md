**Nile** rises from the depths as our latest Featured Artist.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/260/header.jpg)

Emerging in the mid-90's with an unexpected fusion of technical death metal and ancient Middle Eastern melodies, **Nile** is a 4-piece band who has been generating hits for longer than the average osu! player has been alive.

**8** mystical wonders can be discovered from [**Nile**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/260).

It doesn't take a mapping connoisseur to realize **Nile**'s music is best suited to difficult beatmaps. See how [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048) handles [this 260 BPM stream map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1574333) with his unique tapping style, and use that inspiration to design a map of your own!
