**Plum** glissandos his way into our Featured Artist catalogue!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/249/header.jpg)

If high BPM piano melodies are your jam, you've got a friend in **Plum**. **Plum**'s artcore-esque songs are packed to the brim with stream mapping potential, reminiscent of our very own [xi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/727).

**13** tracks have arrived at your doorstep (assuming your doorstep is [**Plum**'s Featured Artist library](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/249)).

Need a sample? [_Epreus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7342798) produced a map of [Maelstrom](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1679690) specifically for this announcement to showcase the true potential of **Plum**'s sound. See how a top player manages that 7 star beatmap, then check out the rest of the previews below:
