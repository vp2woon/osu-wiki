Check out a brief overview of what went down in the osu! community for August with the second issue of the osu!monthly!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-09-01-osumonthly-2/monthlybanner.jpg)

For those not caught up to speed on what the osu!monthly is, osu!monthly is a reimagining of the hit-sensation osu!weekly, but in a bigger (and dare we say, better) format. Make sure to check out [last month's issue](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-08-01-osumonthly-1) if you haven't already!

As this is the second rendition of the recently reawakened project, we are still trying to find a groove and get a sense of what the community likes most and dislikes the least. If you'd like to contribute to any ideas, content, article writing, or anything else that we can feature, please don't be shy and let us know via the [discussion thread on the forums](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1614314) or get involved in the osu!monthly process over on the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy).

With all that out of the way, let's get straight into things!

## What's new in osu!(lazer)

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RxRwqXmMxd4?list=PLmWVQsxi34bMTmgpDArfxJ32Q0mBLhcE-" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The weekly updates for osu!(lazer) continue, most notably featuring a change to the osu! slider animations, which should now more closely match the stable version of the game and hopefully minimise the "weird feeling" players have reported when playing the latest version.

Furthermore, a bunch of new features and fixes have been added into the editor, which will make mappers' lives easier as [OliBomby](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6573093) continues to implement the features from his ever-popular [Mapping Tools](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/940368?n=1) utility directly into osu!(lazer) proper.

Last but not least, global bindings have been reorganised for easier navigation and a lot of behind-the-scenes optimisation should hopefully help improve the osu! experience on a wider range of systems.

If you missed it, [0x84f](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724) released a write-up covering the work that went into [the sound design of osu!(lazer)](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-08-31-the-sound-design-of-lazer) earlier last month. The post goes in-depth about the design process of sound effects for osu!(lazer) and includes snippets of an interview with [nekodex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102), the osu!musician-cross-developer behind it all!

Some people say humans can only see refresh rates up to 60 Hz, but now you can test this yourself with the all-new latency certifier!

Test your perception, reaction time and hardware altogether to help figure out what refresh rate is best for you by opening the settings on osu!(lazer) and clicking "Run latency certifier" (`General` > `Debug` > `Run latency certifier`, or just use the search bar). Feel free to share your results in the comments, or if you're lazy, you can just watch osu! content creator [Willy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3521482) perform the test themselves below:

## Community recap

### COE 2022

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-09-01-osumonthly-2/coebanner.jpg)

cavoe's osu! event (or COE for short) is an annual osu! convention that perfectly embodies the spirit of osu!. It is a joyous celebration for our beloved community and run by that very same community. Conceived from humble beginnings in 2017 by none other than [cavoeboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7361815) himself, it has since grown and expanded to become the international phenomenon that we know and love today.

COE 2022 took place at the Brabanthallen from August 1st to August 7th, organised by [Meyer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5452367), cavoeboy and their incredible team of volunteer staff. Despite its return following a two-year hiatus, COE 2022 saw a record-breaking 750+ attendees, attracting users from almost every continent (we'll get you next time, Antarctica). The lengthy pandemic-enforced delay between COE 2022 and the last event most certainly did not go unnoticed, as evident by the common sentiment from returning attendees of having "missed being here again".

Featuring over 30 hours of live stage events, COE 2022 was certainly ambitious in both range and scale. The immensely popular COE 1v1 tournament made its return, with [okinamo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3765989) crowned champion. In addition, COE 2022 continued to feature a large variety of Q&A panels, including [an incredibly technical dev talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVBVqvpFVL4) hosted by [ThePooN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/718454) and [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2). Group activities such as Efteling and all-you-can-eat sushi were returning favourites, alongside newer entries such as Survivor and [Sotarks](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4452992)' Blind Music Quiz.

Of course, COE 2022 would not be complete without the collaborations of its supporting partners. Make Some Noise's (MSN) home arcade setup and [wooz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6888206)'s arcade (WoozPC) added an impressive catalogue of rhythm games available to experience at the venue. [Senzeeh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2489813)'s Yuki Aim also made an appearance, offering players a chance to win unique merchandise by completing difficult aim-based challenges.

A huge thank you to Meyer for taking charge of organisation this year, alongside all other contributors who helped make this event a success.

### Don't try this at home

You may have heard of a particular osu! content creator by the name of [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) and their long-awaited resurrection on their YouTube channel. Those attending COE 2022 got to witness a video that was in the making for a long while — several years, in fact — as he delved into a *secret operation* to experience just how rough new mappers have it in trying to get their maps ranked.

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WVQDQWcfTGI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

As stated in the video, ***DON'T MULTIACCOUNT, LOSERS***. Mr. Fat had permission to engage in nefarious subterfuge, and you most definitely don't. This discussion has revived rumblings in the community about the concept of "mapper pseudonyms", a long-desired feature which would allow mappers to upload their creations under a chosen anonymous name. Could this be something that makes it into osu! in the future? Only time will tell!

### 15th Anniversary Art Contest

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/153/header.jpg?1)

osu!'s 15th anniversary is coming up, and what better way to celebrate than with an [art contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-08-15-15-anniversary-art-contest)! Similar to the previously held [A Place to Belong](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/142) contest in Spring of 2022, this art contest features a unique thematic twist: artists have to draw at least one of the official osu! mascots *(or community mascots)* exploring any part of osu!'s history!

By the time this monthly is released, submissions will have been closed but we should see the votes coming in very soon, so be sure to cast your votes as a selection of the top-voted entries will be featured within osu! (and get 3 months of osu!supporter), and the top 3 will receive profile badges made in the style of their own submission!

### Crazy community collaboration

![](/wiki/shared/news/2022-09-01-osumonthly-2/collabbanner.jpg)

You might have already seen people with similar profile pictures and banners, as it is quite common within the osu! community to have avatar collaborations (or collabs for short) between players, but have you ever seen a collab with more than a thousand participants? This is the crazy goal that [XegC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8143504) and his team have given to themselves, now entering their 7th edition since the inception of the [Endless Mirage Megacollab](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1619690?n=1)! Last time they managed to gather [3370 players](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/qgig4i/our_6th_avatar_megacollab_is_done_with_3370_users/), and they are aiming even higher this time.

Entries have unfortunately closed on the 30th, but if you are interested in participating in the next edition feel free to join the [Endless Mirage Discord](https://discord.gg/XXtZCZw4M6) and grab yourself a set of free profile pictures, as well as forum and userpage banners!

## Stamina for days

It isn't every day that osu! gets to bear witness such a unique skillset that [Kalanluu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2035254) possesses, let alone one that permits plays such as this spectacle of [Renard - Because Maybe! pt. 3 [Marathon]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/979274#osu/2049467).

Not only is the map a marathon of no easy measure, but Kalanluu also decided to crank up the challenge by not only making it longer with Half Time, but simultaneously making it harder to read and outright see by adding Easy and Flashlight to the mix. Make sure to get comfortable, grab a drink, maybe a snack or two as Kalanluu puts on a tremendous display of talent and hard-fought skill in this long and gruelling 23-minute play:

## Did you see that? No?

As is the classic meme of osu!taiko top performance, this 4-mod insane play baffles anyone that stumbles upon such a feat.

[Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) does not disappoint with a mind-blowing, complete memorisation 4-mod play on [Sparxe - Comma, ~ Imi to Kouzou no Bunri [Horiiizon's Encore]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1785711#taiko/3658314), which is not only impressive in and of itself, but also sets the new performance points record for osu!taiko.

If you've never seen someone magically FC a map with +HDHRDTFL and colours seemingly bouncing out of their judgement circles, this play is definitely for you:

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Cz_D6yjuUE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Brrrzzt! Whoosh! Brzzzt!

Don't think that osu!taiko and osu! can steal the show that easily! The osu!catch showcase for this month comes with a multitude of dashes, hypers, and plays that shouldn't be humanly possible.

[ArMa79](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4982799) appears to do the impossible on [Various Artist - Dan ~ CTB ~ 3rd Pack [~ Shin ~ (Marathon)]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/884597#fruits/1872971), nearly tripling the previous leader's combo, halving the miss count, (and for those who LOVE score) doubling the final score.

The map is filled to the brim with a combination of unrelenting speed, harsh antiflow patterns, and a seemingly infinite and nerve-wracking drain time of just under 10 minutes. Oh, also, did we forget to mention that the play was worth a 350 USD bounty?! Yeah, make sure to add that to the list. ArMa79 continues to impress and shows no sign of stopping anytime soon.

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nQLRD41XdaY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*P.S. If you thought this play was gnarly and want to see more of what happened in August, check out the dedicated [August osu!catch playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL13_euG_GInqpC9jGRyMLSt6gGhbQyxWu)*

## A new dawn approaches

It is no secret that the osu!mania community has had some new developments in the past month, most notably [dressurf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/758406)'s sudden switch from #2 to #1 in the mania rankings. As such madness has not happened in nearly 5 years, the team decided that we should showcase and give a little spotlight to dressurf themself, as achieving such a feat requires nothing but rigorous practice and grinding, and lives only in dreams for many osu! players.

There are a lot of plays that dressurf cranked out in August, but the one that seemed particularly impressive was the LN explosion that is [dj TAKA feat. AiMEE - True Blue [7k Farewell]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1579889#mania/3226089) with DT. An iconic song that most of the osu! community can recognise on the spot has been made into a deceptively complex 7-key mania map with hardly any rest, and an ever-increasing amount of LNs and chords make even the best of the best tremble, but dressurf has pretty much put it to rest.

At more than 20 notes a second, the accuracy and miss count of this score is just outright phenomenal — see for yourself:

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gH5ITuBrx2s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## A bounty as old as time

Even with a change in the osu!mania's #1 spot, it is still important that we highlight those who truly deserve it. [bojii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083439)'s near-perfect play on [Camellia - Bangin' Burst [[4K] EXHAUST Lv.16]](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/mania/506841803) really shows the difficulty and precision needed to claim a [bounty](https://twitter.com/cleanBMS/status/1560222028396990469?s=19).

The map might seem pretty generic at first, but it ramps up in difficulty not in just pattern identification, but in precision and survivability. With the final 10 seconds of the map throwing stream-jacks at a whopping 20 keys per second at the player, it is all too easy to miss, but bojii stuck through and claimed the bounty on the oldest 4K map that had yet to be SS'd.

*p.s. if you thought the mania plays were impressive, you might want to check out the [August osu!mania playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL13_euG_GInpbQBrfgGViDYl8vT-yR0P0) that also adds some honorable mentions for your viewing enjoyment*

## Did you know?

osu! did not support any keyboard inputs when it was released, it was only after a [suggestion was made on the forums](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/431?n=8) that it was added!

Another cool fact: originally you could only press circles with the space bar until a suggestion was made to have "Z" and "X" as the default bindings.

## Monthly community quiz
