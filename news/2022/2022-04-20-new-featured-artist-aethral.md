Sitting comfortably at the intersection between rhythm game music and the hardcore genre is **Aethral**. While his initial fame on osu! came from remixes of the *Persona* soundtrack, his original works have begun to take root in the osu! community.

**12** of his spectacular tracks are here to stay. Check out [**Aethral**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/259) to experience them for yourself.
