We're proud to welcome **Vorso** aboard as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/303/header.jpg)

**Vorso** boldly claims himself to be a "music dude from the South United Kingdom". Believe it or not, our sources say these claims may actually be true.

Ranging from neurofunk to halftime with drum & bass elements mixed in, **Vorso**'s sound is a bit difficult to nail down. His unorthodox style offers unusual rhythm choices, perfect for mappers looking for something new (or a song for your tournament's next NM4/NM6).

**5** of these technical masterpieces are up for grabs from [**Vorso**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/303)!

If you think mapping **Vorso**'s songs will be difficult, you're absolutely right. Take a peek at what [Mun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6699165) and [Hirakawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7516879) came up with in their beatmap of [Midnight Sun (feat. Ekcle)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/818668) alongside 10 skins from [*Chromatic Alteration*](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/148): osu!'s latest skinning contest!
