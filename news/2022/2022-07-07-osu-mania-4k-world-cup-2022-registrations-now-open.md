With the yearly osu!catch World Cup concluded, we hope you all saved some room for rice and noodles as the main course! The osu!mania 4K World Cup 2022 is now here!

Each instalment brings something new to the table, and this year we are proud to announce that after receiving hundreds of requests, we are giving the community more ways to contribute to and support the osu! World Cups. Starting with the osu!mania 4K World Cup 2022, we are utilising an **[Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/osu-tournaments/events/osu-mania-world-cup-4k-6c77ec5b)** to allow for community donations which will directly increase the prize pool for the top 3 teams!

If you're unfamiliar with Open Collective, it is a platform that allows us to coordinate the finances of the World Cups in a transparent way, and also allows users to help support the tournament in greater amounts outside of purchasing profile banners or subscribing to the osu!live Twitch channel. You can do any one (or all) of these things if you want, they'll all still go towards the tournament!

You can donate directly to the prize pool of the upcoming World Cup of your choosing in a lump sum with or without an Open Collective account, and you can even leave a little message of support that will be displayed beneath your contribution, if you like.

*Please note that any "tips" made during the payment process go to Open Collective and not to us!*

For more details on these changes, please refer to the **[osu!mania 4K World Cup 2022 wiki article](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K)**. You can discuss this event and follow the most important changes in the **[official discussion thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1606949?n=1)** or at the public **[community server](https://discord.gg/0Vxo9AsejDkGlk3H)**.

## How do I register?

- **[Click here to sign up!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/34)**
- Do not create teams in advance! Teams will be formed by each country's team captain after the Registration Phase is concluded.
- Submit your registration before the **21st of July, 23:59 UTC**.

Please note that you may only participate if your **osu!mania 4K Global Ranking is #5000 or higher, and you have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months**.

If your registration passes our internal checks, you will be placed on the candidate list for your country. When that country's captain has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

*Remember that any registrations submitted after the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances — submit your registration ahead of time to avoid any last-minute headaches. If you run into any issues, send an email to [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto:tournaments@ppy.sh).*
