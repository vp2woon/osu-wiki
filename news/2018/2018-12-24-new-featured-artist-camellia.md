Camellia when? Now.

You asked...

...we delivered.

There is nothing we could possibly say here to make this any greater than it already is.

**156** tracks are now available over at [his Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31) listing, pre-timed and ready to map.

In addition, some founding members of the Mappers' Guild have been hard at work creating their take on some of the new tracks, which you can check out below (though do note, these maps aren't ranked yet):

**You can check out all of the tracks over at [Camellia's Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31)**. There's just far, far too many to even begin to list them here.

As with all Featured Artists, any of the tracks in his listing are 100% cleared for use in the osu! community. This also encompasses a vast swathe of "classic" beatmaps dating as far back as early 2015.

We hope you all understand how agonizing it has been for us to keep this under wraps, but we felt there was truly no better way to send 2018 off than with our **biggest ever** Featured Artist release.

However, in the now immortal words of one Bubbleman - it's not done yet. We're not done yet.

Keep your eyes and ears peeled into 2019, there's more on the horizon!
