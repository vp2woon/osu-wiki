The results are finally in, and so it is time to announce the winners of Community Choice 2017!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-01-18-community-choice-2017/banner.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/59)

As suggested by the brand new name, we've decided to drop the vote weighting that was a major factor in the previous "best of" votes over the past few years. Community Choice is at its heart, a popularity contest, so we've dropped any pretenses of trying to make the contest anything to the contrary, and have instead embraced it in full.

The votes presented below are thus purely unweighted, raw voting totals for each particular map. One vote is simply one vote - one person's approvement and endorsement of that map as their most favourite of 2017.

Without further ado, here are the grand winners from each game mode:

## osu!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-02-20-community-choice-2017-results/hitorigoto.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/596704)

In an overwhelming display of support that should surprise exactly nobody, [Doormat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3230571)'s set of [ClariS - Hitorigoto -TV MIX-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/596704) takes the title for the osu! game mode Community Favourite of 2017 with an outstanding **4434** votes, nearly a full thousand more than its nearest competitor.

Riding off the (questionable) success of last year's hit anime Eromanga-sensei, Hitorigoto is a track all about talking to one's self, and this highly popular set certainly managed to get people talking.

Notable runners up were:

[Agnete Kjolsrud - Get Jinxed](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/361740) by [Tarrasky](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4098393) in 2nd place overall with **3565** votes.

[\*namirin - Koi no Hime Hime Pettanko](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/485056) by [C u r i](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4746949) in 3rd place overall with **2749** votes.

## osu!taiko

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-02-20-community-choice-2017-results/renren.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/663337)

By the skin of its teeth with only **9** votes between first and second place, [Backfire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/263110)'s set of [Sara - Ren Ren Ai Ai Cir Cir Cula Cula Tion Tion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/663337) snags the title of Community Favourite 2017 for osu!taiko with **117** votes.

Unlike the track itself, we're definitely not stuttering.

Notable runners up were:

[D(ABE3) - MANIERA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/400761) by [\_yu68](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6170507) with **108** votes.

[Dunderpatrullen - We Are Number One (Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/547301) by [Midnaait](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1506011) with **104** votes.

## osu!catch

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-02-20-community-choice-2017-results/onthefm.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/609679)

Fiercely competitive all the way to the end, osu!catch had some of the most robust voting of all the gamemodes so far, a few highly popular maps fighting for the lion's share of the vote.

In the end, [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883)'s set of [C\-Show - On the FM](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/609679) triumphed over the others with **249** votes, and walks away with the title of Community Favourite 2017 for osu!catch.

Notable runners up were:

[DJ Totoriott - Chronoxia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/429184) by [Kyuare](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2705312) with **233** votes.

[Camellia - Towards The Horizon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/629384) by [Sinnoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4236057) with **227** votes.

## osu!mania

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-02-20-community-choice-2017-results/exit.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/575053)

With the biggest turnout among the three smaller gamemodes, the players of osu!mania fought intensely over top spot, with [Protastic101](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6712747)'s set of [Camellia - Exit This Earth's Atomosphere](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/575053) reigning supreme with **754** votes.

This set definitely seemed to send much of the osu!mania community into orbit.

Notable runners up were:

[Dustvoxx - Trigger (Zekk Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/555076) by [Wonki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7898495) with **726** votes.

[t+pazolite - Oshama Scramble!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/511480) by [\[ A v a l o n \]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4632359) with **587** votes.

Each top-voted set has its mapper walk away with a shiny new profile badge, and 6 months of osu!supporter for their efforts. The runners up and the top 10 voted sets for each game mode receive 1 months of osu!supporter as well.

You can view a handy spreadsheet of the full voting results below, or [check out the contest listings for a prettier version](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/59). The listings themselves will display 'points' instead of votes - this is simply a holdover from the way the system once was. No weighting whatsoever has been applied.

Congratulations to all, and we'll see you again next year to decide which beatmaps of 2018 are the community's favourite!
