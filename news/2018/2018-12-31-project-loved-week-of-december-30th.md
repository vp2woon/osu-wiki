The year's coming to an end, but there's always time for [Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120)! Check out the newest selection of maps, and vote for the ones that you'd like to see in the Loved category!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120)

Welcome back to [Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120)! Every two weeks, we pick out a few beatmaps from each game mode that will get their shot at making it into the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). From the maps we selected, you can now vote whether or not you want them to be Loved! Click on each map's header image in this post to be taken to its voting thread.

osu!mania's part of Project Loved returns this week! The immediate changes to see are the lower map count (7 now, instead of 8) and the ongoing process of electing new captains to work in the role of some that are stepping down. This week, [Kamikaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783), [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750) and [aitor98](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3154852) are leaving, and as always, be sure to thank them for all the work they've done for Project Loved! All three of these guys have been with us for quite a while, and osu!mania's Project Loved section wouldn't be the same without them. To follow more closely with changes to osu!mania's Project Loved, you can join their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZMDfqBt) and read the posts made by captains!

After this round, [Backfire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/263110) will also be stepping down from their role as an osu!taiko captain. Leading the osu!taiko section for over a year now, and co-managing the entire project with [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689) for a time, he's done a mountain of work for Project Loved and definitely deserves some appreciation as we see him off. It's no easy feat to do what Backfire has done for Loved over the past year!

In case you don't read the end of this post, be sure to submit suggestions for beatmaps to be added to Loved using the [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbgHOVqMF8wQQKSdddW1JhC10ff6C7fb4JbEW7PBQTn9gAqg/viewform)! All of the nominated beatmaps are chosen from submissions on this form, which you can view in the corresponding [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HgHwtO3kIzT8R4ocEJMZTosADrGJRJOFL-TZI97tZS4/edit#gid=0).

[Haywyre - Insight](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/848400#osu) by [Twiggykun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9126943)\
*written by [waywern2012](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5870453)*

Starting with a long awaited map to be Loved, Twiggykun's map of the song Insight by Haywyre will test your alternating skill as well as aim control on 140 BPM non-stop jumps. The song is calm most of the time, but the middle part truly becomes alive with the combination of beats and jumps. The HP drain is 3, but don't let that fool you, as the OD is punishing for missing only a few notes! The melody of the song is adventurous, and by adding some techy-themed sounds it fits in well with the map.

[Kings Of The City - Wrong (Muzzy Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/414582#osu) by [Hikaru Rose](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4811275)\
*written by [waywern2012](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5870453)*

You can only go right with this one. The map from Hikaru Rose is a truly great and satisfying experience. The comfortable jumps and tricky short streams alongside Muzzy's remix of "Kings Of The City - Wrong" makes you homed in on the map. The storyboard by Cheesecake fits perfectly for this beatmap as it is subtle and keeps cool while you play. Just sit back and enjoy the close blend of the map and the song.

[Harada Hitomi - Kyoumei no True Force](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/315159#osu) by [Asphyxia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1715720)\
*written by [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050)*

A true classic, Asphyxia's Kyoumei No True Force has weathered the storm and continues to this day to be a clean yet testing map that nearly everyone has seen or played before. Being mostly aim focused, its star rating is deceiving, and with the difficulty creeping up as the map plays out you might find yourself pushing the limits of your abilities as you near the marathon's end. With 70 favourites, I'm sure you'll enjoy it too, regardless of whether you're playing it for the first or even the tenth time.

[Utsu-P - MiKUSABBATH](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/264483#osu) by [Kuron-kun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2697284) and [Tarrasky](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4098393)\
*written by [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050)*

A tribute to older styles of maps, MiKUSABBATH's style is clean, yet it's easy to find patterns inspired by older creations. Squares are scattered throughout, and with few streams this is another aim test yet with a different feel and flow. A lower difficulty by Tarrasky is included with an even older style yet still producing the same nostalgic feeling, and when combined with this banger of a song, the set produces a feeling best appreciated by experiencing it yourself. What are you waiting for? Give it a go!

Those who follow Project Loved will recognize this title from a previous map covered by "nameless" that was Loved back in November. This time we have the original by PinocchioP. Dating back to 2016, this map by Nattu was the first to gain the song popularity throughout the community with help from being featured in HappyStick's Summer Tour map pool. With over 120 favorites, it made a name for itself as a challenging alternating styled map for players to practice on while listening to some good tunes.

*written by [BeasttrollMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691)*

Although this map remains unfinished months after its submission, it's gained massive popularity after many top players such as Toy, Mathi, and NerO were seen making FCs on the map over the past year. Today, it is seen as a quick way to practice and test player's technical streaming abilities as the map contains many patterns that require players to snap while maintaining full control of their cursor. With over 110 favorites, check out the map and vote for its place in Project Loved!

[Shibayan feat. 3L - Getsurei 11.3 no Candle Magic](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/122390#osu) by [11t](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2112092), [10nya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/678794) and [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128)\
*written by [fartownik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/56917)*

If it was up to me, this set would've been ranked a long time ago. Sadly, there's no way of that happening ever as 11t is no longer with us, and thus I feel like it's in my duty as a community member and a Loved captain to use my power so maps like this don't go unnoticed and fall into the pit of forgetfulness forever.

Now, let's get to the map! Lunar 11.3 Candle Magic is another profound project of the mapper and storyboarder 11t, author of some famous storyboard projects such as EOS or Okaerinasai. This time 11t also participated as a mapper, creating three out of four of the standard difficulties for this set. The most difficult of them, \[Lunatic\], takes on a rather classical approach on alternating maps, drawing inspiration from mappers such as val0108 and executing it masterfully.

The storyboard for the map is one of the first of this genre. It may not be as intricate as aforementioned EOS or Okaerinasai, but it still does a great job at what it's supposed to do and is overall a great pleasure to watch and play.

*written by [fartownik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/56917)*

Ever wanted to enjoy some great orchestral music while simultaneously watching a classic Tom & Jerry segment while simultaneously clicking circles to the beat? Look no further fam, we've got you. This map by IwanWenChoong is an experience unlike any other. The amount of work put by this man solely to time this piece can be counted in hours (contains 500+ unique timing sections with varying BPMs), not to mention mapping the entire 7-minute thing!

The map itself may not be the most technically correct, but you can clearly see the mapper put his heart and soul into it to express the symphony best they could. Surely one of the most unique beatmaps you will ever see in this game. Give it a try, you won't regret it!

Hey, Argentinian osu! community! Here's a gift for you. Hosted by MaestroSplinter, this mapset has various guest difficulties for the iconic song in the Marolio commercial. The map itself hovers right around the 40 second mark—short and sweet. The star difficulty range for all difficulties is notably low, so the mapset can be played and enjoyed by players of all skill ranges. Give flavor to the Loved category by dropping a vote on this classic jingle!

Did anyone miss seeing 2B maps in the Loved voting? Here, I'll fix that. The mapper "Hishiro Chizuru", inspired by various other mappers, has made an energetic beatmap to go along with an equally energetic remix of the song "Stargazer". This 3-minute beatmap is mixed with modern technical sections, innovative 2B patterns, and various slider velocity changes. Topped off with a storyboard by Rhonen and hitsounding by Ambrew, the map has seen a heavy amount of support from you guys, the community. With the map having over 150 favorites, it's time for you to cast your vote and help bring this map into the Loved category!

Good Bye, Mr. Jack is our first pick for the week, featured in the osu!taiko World Cup 2018 as the tiebreaker for Group Stages, and for good reason! This jazzy song really gives you that "boss fight" feeling, and tkdLolly really emphasizes this perfectly, by using slider velocities to make clear different instruments, counterpoints and intensities, making this truly enjoyable to play. Beware though, as it also does a great job at packing quite a punch and being really tough, with long 1/6 bursts and varying slider velocities that will challenge your reading skills. Don't trip on the 1/16 grace notes!

Secondly, we brought Shinbatsu o Tadori KyouKotsu ni Itaru, as we were really hyped by the possible addition of Imperial Circus Dead Decadence to the Featured Artists. shinchikuhome's map is a solid proof that a great player can make a great map, and what a way to do it: this streamy 250 BPM map can look very innocent, sure, we have a lot of streamy maps with even higher BPM, how much damage could a 250 BPM song do?... well, a lot. Between its solid patterns and the song length, this really is a stamina drainer like no other, so be adviced and make sure to warm up before tackling this one down.

It's very likely that a lot of people from Japan that used to play multiplayer lobbies will recognize this map. Even though it's high-BPM, Y O U T A's Walk This Way! was designed with comfy patterns that are truly easy to get the hang of, resulting in a really fun map for those who love high-BPM, so if you are one of those people, I'm sure you will like this map. I personally think this is really is a popular map within the Japanese community and a really high quality one too. Enjoy!

We all know tasuke912 as one of the best mappers last year, and here he makes his appearance with Prepared Improvisation, a techy map that has that particularity that most tasuke maps have: the more you play them, the more you fall in love with them!. With a chaotic-sounding jazz song he made a truly beautiful map, which may seem frustrating at first due to its constant 1/8 triplets, the rather repetitive song (mostly because of the base drumroll) and such, but believe me, it can get really satisfying to play once you get the hang of it.

Between the vast mapping experience of KitajimaYN and the great understanding of the game mode hoku shows in their Heisei Memehunters, you can already start to expect a well designed and fun map. This map shows an excellent control over density and where exactly to go ham on it, as well as a impeccable flow-based mapping style, being KitajimaYN's trademark. The streams of this map truly meet all expectations and are so carefully placed that the map as a whole makes a lot of sense: I think it'd truly be a great addition to the Loved section!

*written by [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)*

This aspire-like map by Memoriola (also known by their previous name OneLoveOneLife) is particularly interesting because of the sheer amount of creativity. You will encounter a lot of patterns which are very uncommon for osu!catch, but on the other hand make this map as interesting as it is. The craziness of the mapping fits well to the craziness of the song. It's certainly a unique experience—but it is definitely not easy to play. It challenges your speed and platter control and paired with the higher AR it also becomes a reading test. Good luck; you'll need it!

*written by [Sartan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4100941)*

Entering the Loved section for the first time is \[\_-Kukkai-\_\]! With an arsenal of underappreciated maps in his graveyard, Magus Night remix is one of his most favourited maps and showcases the tough but fun to play mapping style of \[\_-Kukkai-\_\] the best. With a variety of streams and jumps this map feels very adequate in terms of difficulty, without any kind of overly difficult patterns that don't make sense music-wise.

All-in-all the map offers lots of replayability. This is because of the solid base map that can very well be made even more interesting by throwing either HardRock and/or Hidden into the mix. It is definitely doable for higher end players and adds some spice. So see for yourself what you think of it?

Starting us off in the mania Loved nominations will be XeoStyle returning with his chart for Lone Digger, a rather popular song with a simplistic and enjoyable approach. As the difficulty name suggests, this chart will throw plenty of chordjacks at the player for the full three and a half minutes of its run-time. The simplistic and fun nature of the chart has netted it an extensive amount of popularity among players and is easy enough to be approachable by many, making it a clear choice for the Loved section.

Originally on pace to be ranked, Peter on Crack is a marathon map designed by none other than the legend himself—Jole! This is an even longer version of the chart used for the osu!mania 4K World Cup 2017 Semi-Finals pool, which not only increases the arduous dial but has patterning that's even trickier by comparison. With 33 favourites at time of writing, we thought we'd give it a crack at putting it up for this week's Loved vote.

Loved veteran Shoegazer and protégé Vortex- combine efforts for the next set being nominated, Ubiquity. The set features two difficulties, one made by each of the two charters mentioned, with each showcasing their varying styles through the subtle differences in layering and patterning choices. Both difficulties also showcase the extremely refined charting prowess that both of these charters have, as many have seen through their previously loved charts, like Tenohira de Odoru from Vortex- or Toki from Shoegazer. If these past works were of any interest to you, Ubiquity will be sure to deliver on the fronts of both charters.

If you are looking for a challenge, you need look no further than Big Brother, a very difficult chart created by Wh1teh. The difficulty of the chart comes largely from dense, awkwardly patterned bursts in the choruses that can trip up even the best players. Used in previous tournaments and briefly in a skill course, this challenge has been made clear to many high-level players and its use as an effective skill-tester is a good point of support for its nomination to the Loved section.

The last time we saw moni get a chart in Loved was almost two years ago, back before Project Loved even existed! Now they're finally back with You & I, consisting of both 4K and 7K difficulties. Both difficulties are layered fairly similarly, targeting a multitude of different LN skill sets, whether it be releases, streams, or even inverse at times. Plus, the patterns get progressively denser throughout the song, making this a much more engaging mapset. The featured pattern usage, competitive viability, and general popularity of this set makes it a good indicator of LN skill and a good fit for a Project Loved nomination.

pporse makes it back for Loved voting once again with his chart AMAZING BREAK. This chart mainly features varying chordstreams at 153 BPM. What make this a chart worthy of going up for loved is its interesting usage of LNs, jacks, 1/6th streams, and SVs. All of these components lead up to a climactic ending section which will test the players abilities in all these skill sets. If you want an amazing experience, this chart is worth checking out!

People have been asking for a **while** about when tangjinxi was going to get a map nominated, so we figured this would be a great start for that. Otenba Renjyo is a very dense LN pick that primarily focuses on LN chordstreams... and when I say dense, I mean it. This chart comes in at 8.34 stars, and doesn't let down. Outside of a break period in the middle and a few bursts towards the end, it strictly keeps up dense LN chordstreams. Whether you're an adept LN player able to play this chart to practice accuracy, or an up-and-coming player trying to climb through difficult LN charts to improve your skill, Otenba Renjyo serves as a great benchmark to help quantify your LN skill thanks to its consistency.
