If there's one thing that sets osu! apart from other communities, it's the amount of different stories to be told. This episode of the osu! Coffee Hour will be the second in our Gamemode History series, where we dive into the unique story behind each one. We're dedicating this installment to osu!taiko, the second mode to join the osu! ranks nearly 10 years ago.

## This week's theme

What better time for osu!taiko than the day before the Taiko World Cup live drawings? Joining me ([HappyStick](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/256802)) this Friday will be [Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2239480) and [karterfreak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1031958).

Raiden is an osu!taiko mapper, modder and player, who's been active in the mapping and modding scene since June 2015, a former Beatmap Nominator and current member of the Quality Assurance Team for osu!taiko. He has participated in the renewal of the old osu!taiko Ranking Criteria and has hosted his own Mentorship Program and Mapping Contest. He has also played for Spain in two Taiko World Cups, and will play his 3rd one this year.

karterfreak (previously known as Tasha) is a semi-active member of the osu!taiko community who has been playing since 2012, and has both played and commentated for multiple Taiko World Cups. He has also been involved with writing for the osu!weekly and was one of the original osu!taiko BAT. As a player, he has a unique take due to his unorthodox DDKK playstyle.

Given the impressive resumes above we'll have a ton to go over! We'd like to instill osu!taiko players with a sense of pride and deeper understanding of the mode they've grown to love, whilst also giving the uninitiated a new perspective, and maybe even lighting the spark of curiosity in those who might be on the fence about giving osu!taiko a try.

## Questions?

As per usual, **we're looking for your questions!**

If you have questions for Raiden or karterfreak regarding osu!taiko, or suggestions for specific osu!taiko moments over the years that you want to hear more about, let us know below!

We'll choose the top upvoted comments to present to the guests for discussion on the show.

## When is this happening?

The next episode of the osu! Coffee Hour will be happening this Saturday, the [31st of March, at 1PM UTC](http://itsalmo.st/#osutaiko_ivbip) over at [osulive](http://www.twitch.tv/osulive).

We'll see you there!
