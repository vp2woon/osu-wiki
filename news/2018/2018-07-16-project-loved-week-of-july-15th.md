[Shoko Nakagawa remixed by Assertive - Sorairo Days (Assertive Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/439285) by [KoTo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1382805)\
*written by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

A NoMod player's playground, this unranked KoTo map has certainly gained popularity over the last few years. This upbeat song is accompanied by a map of 7\* flowy jumps and spaced streams. If that sounds like your cup of tea, be sure to try this map out for yourself and earn yourself a spot on this map's loved leaderboard!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-07-16-project-loved-week-of-july-15th/osu/dadadadadadadadadada-long-version.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/775631)

[Hige Driver join. SELEN - DADADADADADADADADADA (Long Version)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/295422) by [Lokovodo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2154081)\
*written by [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689)*

Here you go. You've all asked for this. The infamous 10\* Lokovodo map that only the legends can pass. Its popularity is undeniable from its 600+ favorites and its patterns will leave your hands pretzeled. Not for the faint of heart.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-07-16-project-loved-week-of-july-15th/osu/super-nuko-world.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/775632)

[yuikonnu & ayaponzu\* - Super Nuko World](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/173302) by [Saten](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/444506)\
*written by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

Super Nuko World—many of you have likely played Guy's guest difficulty of the popular mapset of this song. Don't brush off this loved set, though—no matter how many times you've retried the ranked set, this map of Super Nuko World by Saten gives the song a fresh experience. With engaging rhythm and some creative stream patterns, anyone who enjoyed the ranked version of this song should definitely give this version a spin.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-07-16-project-loved-week-of-july-15th/osu/double-pendulum.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/775633)

[BlackY - Double Pendulum](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/695053) by [rrtyui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/352328), [Ameth Rianno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5219516) and [Firis Mistlud](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2433720)\
*written by [Kaifin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596942)*

Double Pendulum is a gorgeous collaboration between rrtyui, Ameth Rianno, and Firis Mistlud which features a great storyboard by [-Tochi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3664366). All four of these names are no stranger to the Loved category for good reason, and this map is truly stands out as an extremely quality chart of an interesting, varied song with plenty of exciting patterns and expressive rhythms. Be sure to give it a play with the storyboard enabled at least once!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-07-16-project-loved-week-of-july-15th/osu/dominus.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/775634)

*written by [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689)*

This is an impressive older 2012 collab set from Akemi\_Homura, Revy and Poggo, formerly known as Katty Pie. The bumping 190 BPM bass will send shivers to your spine matching well with the skull and crossbones hitcircles, the skull background, and the flashing skeleton storyboard. Having gone through the qualified section once in 2015 but never returning, this map is simply a delight to play all around.

[YUC'e - Future Cider](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/591058) by [KinomiCandy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/375143)

Another signature KinomiCandy map, the partner to his now-Loved "Future Candy" map, this is really just more of that comforting style. The map features concepts that are at this point standard for Kinomi, and light 1/6. I'd love to talk more about this map, but these series of maps from Kinomi really just speak for themselves.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-07-16-project-loved-week-of-july-15th/taiko/sendan-life.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/775642)

[Remo Prototype[CV: Hanamori Yumiri] - Sendan Life](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/395660) by [Y O U T A](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4909860) and [SKSalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3280542)

A set long since requested for Loved, Sendan Life is one of Y O U T A's first sets that he attempted to rank, and while they were never able to get over that hurdle of actually ranking it, the set ends up here in Loved (we aren't complaining)! Lots of variety for all types of players, the full set has plenty to offer for everyone. A great, energetic song really goes a long way into carrying it into the spotlight. We're really excited to share it with everyone!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-07-16-project-loved-week-of-july-15th/taiko/speed-of-link.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/775643)

[antiPLUR - Speed of Link](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/404793) by [SKSalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3280542)

SKSalt is not a mapper known for making extremely hard maps (although he may have had the reputation in the past), but this is truly the hardest set he has made. While a lot of people will be familiar with the difficulty name "Crazy Oni", that's not the main draw to this set, as SKSalt has amped it up with the "HUMAN EXTINCTION" difficulty name. Pretty intimidating, huh? Well, it lives up to its name, with an array of extremely long and dense streams at over 280 BPM. Think you can go fast enough?

[RoughSketch & Massive New Krew ft. Nanahira - Extreme Music School](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/608906) by [katacheh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6651672)

There's really no way to expect what katacheh is going to bring to you in a map... except for gimmicks, of course. Tons and tons of gimmicks, all over the place, bursting with gimmicks. This one in particular features a lot of "slide windows" as you can see through the windows to see a lot of notes, among all of his other commonly used gimmicks. This map is quite a bit more difficult than kata's normal maps to pass, so you'll need to study this one hard!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-07-16-project-loved-week-of-july-15th/taiko/blaze.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/775645)

[Cornandbeans - Blaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/228460) by [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128)

A classic from the early days, Blaze is one of OnosakiHito's most popular maps. A lot of older players will recognize this map from the osu!taiko World Cup 2015, where it appeared in the finals NoMod pool. Long streams are the main course for this map, and it's really a treat for players who are more accustomed to the older style of difficulty presented in maps. Ono's mapping style has remained a style that is polarizing, for its authentic style feel, but we believe this is a map fit to be Loved!

## osu!catch

*All osu!catch descriptions written by [SartNYAN OwO XD](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4100941)*

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-07-16-project-loved-week-of-july-15th/catch/feelin-sky-camellia-s-200step-self-remix.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/775650)

[Camellia - Feelin Sky (Camellia's "200step" Self-remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/713891) by [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598)

Feelin sky is definitely one of Spectator's more ambitious maps. Because this is one of his latest creations, Spectator has found a close to perfect balance between playability and gimmick, something you would expect from this highly-regarded mapper. That is not to say that the map is easy though, with many slider velocity changes, hard-to-hit left-right patterns and just overall difficulty, Feeling Sky is a map only high-end players can play properly. With that said, I highly recommend you check out the map yourself, as it is quite different from Spectator's regular maps, but its creative aspect is really interesting and can really grow on you over time.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-07-16-project-loved-week-of-july-15th/catch/unmei-no-dark-side-rolling-gothic-mix.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/775651)

[Kanpyohgo - Unmei no Dark Side -Rolling Gothic mix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/454574) by [dazzulay](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1948043)

dazzulay is not someone often seen in the limelight of osu!catch mapping, but that is not to say that his maps aren't great fun. With some excellent clean patterning that really fits the instruments of Unmei no Dark Side, dazzulay was able to create a very nice map that feels both very playable but still creative and different from your average run-of-the-mill map. It mainly consists of clean, not-too-challenging left-right patterns, some longer than usual sliders and your occasional jumping pattern. All in all, the song makes for an extremely accessible and fun map for the majority of the playerbase, and it definitely needs some attention!

## osu!mania

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-07-16-project-loved-week-of-july-15th/mania/circles-daikyi-vocal-cover.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/775654)

[Nekodex - Circles (Daikyi Vocal Cover)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/492143) by [Halogen-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/169992)\
*written by [TheToaphster](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811)*

Bring out your duuuuu's and get ready for the arrival of a familiar tune, because to start off the osu!mania spotlights, we are nominating Halogen-'s chart for Nekodex - Circles, but with a bit of a twist. This version of the song is an a cappella performed by the one and only Daikyi, submitted for the 2016 osu!idol competition, showing off his wonderful beatboxing and singing talents that ultimately netted him 2nd place.

As amusing as it may be to chart (and make an a cappella for) a song that has dug its way into the minds of anyone who has opened osu!, Halogen-'s rendition is certainly not a joke of a chart. The chart begins with some 1/4 jumpstream patterns and eventually transitions into a break, where bursts and single streams begin to show their face. This is then capped off with the final kiai where extended 1/6 rolly streams are added to nicely compliment Daikyi's silky smooth voice.

All in all, this chart proves to be an amusing and enjoyable chart to play; fitting for a song covered in such a fun way, which certainly makes this chart a viable nominee for the loved section.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-07-16-project-loved-week-of-july-15th/mania/doutei-korose-short-ver.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/775655)

[Yamamoto Momiji - Doutei Korose (short Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/428029) by [ALEFY](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1291769)\
*written by [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750)*

Next up we have an inconspicuous, yet extremely fun map made by ALEFY. Doutei Korose was featured in the group stage of the osu!mania 4K World Cup 2016 and it has given ALEFY's charts a lot of recognition.

Doutei Korose is so pleasant because despite of the map's rather low difficulty, it is patterned very creatively, especially when it comes to LN usage, perfectly augmenting the lively nature of the song. It is a great example that an easier map does not have to be boring. Players attempting the SV difficulty must also face a tricky quad, that teleports closer and closer with each tick appearing in the song. With that in mind, Doutei Korose is a great addition to Loved category!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-07-16-project-loved-week-of-july-15th/mania/odin.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/775656)

[Shiraishi - Odin](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/352759) by [Fullerene-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2531335)\
*written by [TheToaphster](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811)*

Do you want to go fast? Well do I have the chart for you. Whipping out the Stepmania once again, we are nominating Fullerene-'s Odin. Similar to the previously nominated [Trickstarz](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/349432), this is a speed fest that doesn't change too much in its overall goals: to bombard the player with blistering 326 BPM light jumpstreams that just keep going and going, with the patterning progressively getting tougher and the final stretch upping the density to really give players' stamina a run. As such, in a similar fashion, it is commonly used as a benchmark for high level speed players and was even used alongside previously mentioned Trickstarz as a finals pick in the osu!mania 4K World Cup 2015. Combine all of these elements with the fun it is to play, and it only makes sense to add Odin to the Loved section!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-07-16-project-loved-week-of-july-15th/mania/sakura-sweets-keii-bootleg.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/775657)

[sky-fi - sakura sweets (keii bootleg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/326875) by [Agka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/64811)\
*written by [Kamikaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783)*

Agka is known to the vast majority of older players as a mapper who changed the tides of osu!mania charting as a whole; he was one of the pioneers of heavy SV changes and one of the most creative mappers of his day, and this map you're seeing in the listing here shows all of that.

sakura sweets is a chart that was featured in semi-finals stage of the osu!mania 7K World Cup 2017, and it's a chart we like to refer as an SV chart, however saying just that is underrepresenting what the chart actually is. Starting off pretty tame, you won't see what the map is all about until you reach the first chorus. It's built around the stop gimmick, 0 BPM sections where the playfield stops entirely, something that was never utilized to this extent before. In the middle section we have another never-seen-before section of constant "flowing" scroll speed changes, from slow to fast and back to slow again.

It's a pioneering chart that was one of the bigger influences on the gimmick charting scene we see today and that's why we believe it deserves a spot in the Loved category!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-07-16-project-loved-week-of-july-15th/mania/negative-legacy.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/775658)

[Primary - Negative Legacy](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/171847) by [Sorarei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1814885) et al.\
*written by [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750)*

A map which almost made it to the Ranked section but was then abandoned, Negative Legacy is another well-known 7K mapset. It has been mapped by Sorarei (previously known as Reikosaka), with guest difficulties made by Arzenvald (ExUsagi), ArcherLove and Skalim, whose final difficulty appeared in the osu!mania 7K World Cup 2016.

The mapset itself is mostly LN-oriented, with emphasis on short, stream-like long notes which are rather hard to read. Choruses are especially tricky, as density noticeably ramps up. Another important aspect of the map is the SVs scattered throughout the chart, which make it really fluid and dynamic, although they may take some time to get hang of. With that in consideration, as well as the fact that Negative Legacy contains a whole spread of difficulties, we want to give this mapset a second life by nominating it for Loved section.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-07-16-project-loved-week-of-july-15th/mania/owari-no-sekai-kara.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/775659)

*written by [Kamikaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783)*

Do you like keysounded charts? Well this is something for you. dudehacker is a mapper known mostly for the effort he puts into making sure his hitsounds are up to par with the best, however this map is unique on its own. This is a cover of Maeda Jun & Yanagi Nagi's Owari no Sekai kara sung by 2014 osu!idol runner-up [Sharlo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1622450), for which the the instrumental is made out of mostly piano keysounds. Complimented with a two-keymode set, with guest difficulties by LordRaika as well as Protastic101, this set is a very interesting experience for both newer and experienced players. I believe this set is going to be a great addition to the Loved category!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-07-16-project-loved-week-of-july-15th/mania/re-end-of-a-dream.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/775660)

[uma vs. Morimori Atsushi - Re : End of a Dream](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/519849) by [qodtjr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3021168)\
*written by [aitor98](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3154852)*

qodtjr (also known as baengseok) has been around for a few years already, being recognized due to his high-level charts, and he even managed to get one map in the Loved section back in May, which was [Dreamin' attraction!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/517221). Well, this time, he shows up again with a similar map in terms of patterns but way shorter length-wise. This map mostly consist in chordstreams and a few jacks in some intersections, but do not be fooled by this. Even though the map is relatively short with a drain time of 2:19, it gets progressively denser as you play through the chart.

Every player who plays this should definitely keep an eye on the ending section, where the density reaches its peak, being followed by an intersection full of running-man-like jacks that could throw you off with ease. Definitely something worth enough for Loved.
