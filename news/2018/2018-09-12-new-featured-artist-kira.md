Showcasing the best fusion of pop music and Vocaloids to date, we're proud to present our newest addition to the Featured Artist roster - **KIRA**!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/27/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/27)

Inspired by osu! to start delving into the scene himself, **KIRA** has taken the Vocaloid music community by storm in recent years with several smash pop hits, such as *Circles* and *MONSTER*, the latter netting over *4.3million views on YouTube.*

Damn.

We know that osu! players by far and large have a definite craving for Vocaloid-themed tracks, and we also know that you guys are partial to a little bit of pop here and there - so we're especially proud to announce that we have **ten** new poppy wonders available for mapping now over at [**KIRA**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/27).

Not simply content with being simply a delight to the ears, **KIRA**'s work is also accompanied by a unique music video for each track - all included by default in each download!

Check out a small sample of what's available:

As with all Featured Artist releases, anything you can find on his listing is free for use in osu! mapping forever, so worry less and map more!

The end of the year is going to be relatively packed with new Featured Artist stuff, with one new artist in the wings waiting to be released, and a tracks update coming in the next few months to expand the library of some of our existing artists, so keep your eyes and ears peeled!
