Representing 24 countries from around the world, the greatest osu!mania 7K players embarked on a challenging journey with nothing to lose, and everything to prove. With stronger teams and a devilishly tricky mappool to match, a new bar for competition was set, and the matches were more exciting than ever.

A new tournament management saw major overhauls to the stream layout and tournament format, most notably the decision to change to a 2v2 format. These risks paid off in triple, and we peaked at a staggering 1800+ viewers on osu!live during the Grand Finals match. Needless to say, it was by far the most successful osu!mania 7K World Cup to date.

Without further ado, let's get to the results!

**With a near-flawless track record, Team South Korea takes the title of osu!mania 7K Champions of 2018!**

Led by veteran player [jakads](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/259972), Team South Korea showed unparalleled consistency throughout the tournament, with notable performances from [Kim_GodSSI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2218047) and [Estonians](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7014697). They will continue to defend their title for another year, once again proving that they are the dominant force in the osu!mania 7K community.

Team South Korea will take home the grand prize - $150 per team member, profile badge, and the highly coveted "osu!mania Champion" user title for one year!

**Coming in 2nd place, Team Malaysia proudly walks away with silver!**

Team Captain [Cryolien](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1626983) led his team with unshakable conviction, resulting in their truly splendid performance. A special shoutout to [cheewee10](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4477497) for his godly performance that could surpass even jakads at times - an impressive feat for his World Cup debut. Well done to [ZYuan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3337688) and [[MY]Idiot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2059742) as well, for holding their own towards the later stages.

Team Malaysia will receive a prize of $80 per team member, and a MWC 7K profile badge to commemorate their success.

**Team China will take home the bronze for their spectacular run this year!**

Leading the team was [ZhangFan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/89545), an experienced veteran with a history dating back to 2009. Team China also saw its fair share of new blood in the form of [qx0407](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10569738), whose performance was exemplary for their World Cup debut. Even without [Sern888](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2089244) participating from last year, Team China was still able to take a spot on the podium - a testament to their true strength.

Team China will receive a prize of $40 per team member, and a MWC 7K profile badge to commemorate their success.

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all the players for their excellent sportsmanship, and the tournament staff for the herculean effort that they've put in behind the scenes - for without their undying commitment and dedication, this World Cup would not have been as successful and amazing as it was. Finally, I'd also like to thank all the viewers for showing support for their teams and creating a truly wonderful environment for such a fantastic contest.

Perhaps this tournament was the push that osu!mania 7K needed to surge in popularity? We hope to see more relevant community tournaments in the near future, and we would be more than happy to support them!

Remember, rhythm is just a click away!

See you next time!
