The voting was among the closest it's ever been this year, but you've had your say, and we've got **fifteen** winners to share!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-09-summer-2018-fanart-contest-results/banner.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/66)

Continuing on the timeless tradition of making the voting **absurdly** difficult for everyone involved, 72 intrepid artists put their best summer-themed pieces for the community to judge and after a whole week of agonizing waiting, we finally have our results!

Without further ado:

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-09-summer-2018-fanart-contest-results/Evaine.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/66/winners/Evaine.png)

In first place with a blistering **7329** votes is [Evaine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7295733)'s positively breathtaking piece featuring Aiko and Alisa cooling off in a shallow pond beneath a starlit sky.

This is about as tastefully intimate as we've ever seen a fanart contest entry get, and with more poise and grace than we honestly could've ever expected from a *tit*ular summer-themed contest.

A truly fantastic piece, and a well deserved win from one of our long-time participants - who by the way, has also won the [Spring 2017](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/45) contest, and been voted into the winning finalists in [nearly](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/36) [every](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/48) [single](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/56) [fanart contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/58) we've held since.

Yowza.

Second place went to [Alba](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12164832)'s frilly and flowery masterpiece, with **6710** voters wishing they were among the sunflowers in Pippi's arms.

The skies all but sang the praises of summer in a beautifully muted wave of colour that produced perhaps one of the most evocative entries we've ever seen, at least in this author's humble opinion.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-09-summer-2018-fanart-contest-results/Sylux6.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/66/winners/Sylux6.png)

Summer means swimsuits, and [Sylux6](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2607507) absolutely delivered, hosing down third place with **6660** votes for this particularly *endowed* take on Mocha and Pippi enjoying some fun in the sun.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-09-summer-2018-fanart-contest-results/Sunako.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/66/winners/Sunako.png)

Scoring **6433** votes, [Sunako](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2801166)'s sunlit piece featured Pippi, Aiko and Mocha enjoying some time at the beach. This one wins a bonus mention from us for absolutely superb renditions of all three mascot designs in perhaps their most pure form yet.

And getting to see more Aiko is never a bad thing, especially when she's enjoying herself so much!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-09-summer-2018-fanart-contest-results/Shuuzo.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/66/winners/Shuuzo.png)

Flying high with **5913** votes, [Shuuzo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3661521) nearly knocked the ball out of the beach with his take of Pippi enjoying a game of catch with a giant inflatable ball. Simple, but superb.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-09-summer-2018-fanart-contest-results/TheTofuBoi.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/66/winners/TheTofuBoi.png)

Sticks at the ready, [TheTofuBoi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4817223) drummed up **5631** votes with his vibrant take on Mocha and a pair of dons making themselves known.

He's also made a [speedpainting video](https://youtu.be/2TDP-GC3tkE) detailing the whole process, check it out if you're interested!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-09-summer-2018-fanart-contest-results/rennine.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/66/winners/rennine.png)

**4899** votes heralded [rennine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6140529)'s fantastically unique rendition of Pippi and Mocha in summer dress, featuring a few nifty little accessory touches and some of the nicest costume design we've seen overall in a while.

All of our finalists are truly something special, and this one is really something quite distinct and gorgeous. Well done!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-09-summer-2018-fanart-contest-results/aets.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/66/winners/aets.png)

A tidal wave of **4890** votes brought [aets](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12379188)' piece ashore, sporting Pippi and Mocha riding the maelstrom, and a little pyun surfing off in the distance.

Bonus points from us for extremely creative use of the template design!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-09-summer-2018-fanart-contest-results/PaperDawge.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/66/winners/PaperDawge.png)

**4567** votes cheered all four of the main mascots on in [PaperDawge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7721841)'s well-received piece. Rare to see them all together, and even rarer to see Yuzu sporting his height and pecs over the poor shortness that is Mocha.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-09-summer-2018-fanart-contest-results/R3_AL.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/66/winners/R3_AL.png)

**4537** people were ready for SUMMER TIME!!! with [R3_AL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11983357)'s take on a schoolgirl Pippi in of course, summer uniform. Sometimes less is more!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-09-summer-2018-fanart-contest-results/snowyani2000.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/66/winners/snowyani2000.png)

**4337** brave souls managed to pick through the sea of references in [snowyani2000](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2691590)'s latest entry. A paragraph (or five) couldn't do the sheer number of cameos justice. *Among other things that shall not be named nor encouraged.*

We would just like to politely note that *someone* apparently can defeat Airman, if a candid little shot in this piece is to be believed. Have fun finding who it is!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-09-summer-2018-fanart-contest-results/YaoiForeva.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/66/winners/YaoiForeva.png)

**3933** voters probably did not expect to see a mermaid Aiko and Mocha, but that is precisely what they got from [YaoiForeva](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7959038)'s adorable entry. Blub blub blub. They're almost too cute for this world.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-09-summer-2018-fanart-contest-results/Yaruwashi.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/66/winners/Yaruwashi.png)

Is there really anything more iconic than fireworks at a festival for a Japanese-themed summer? **3506** voters agreed, sending their support for [Yaruwashi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12024581)'s entry. Featuring Pippi, Mocha and Maria enjoying themselves with all the classic treats, this one definitely shines bright.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-09-summer-2018-fanart-contest-results/Reivaru-.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/66/winners/Reivaru-.png)

**3506** votes rose the heat for [Reivaru\-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11084189)'s piece, showcasing Pippi and Mocha enjoying a bit of relief from the summer sky under a straw hat and umbrella.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-09-summer-2018-fanart-contest-results/Vio.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/66/winners/Vio.png)

And last but certainly not least, **3468** votes took Pippi's invitation to take a walk down the beachside wharf in [Vio](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5661237)'s striking entry. Really, how could you say no to that face?
