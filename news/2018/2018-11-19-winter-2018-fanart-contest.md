The year might be drawing to a close, but that doesn't mean it's time to close your drawings! Draw any of the osu! official or community mascots enjoying winter for fun and glory, and maybe even see your piece in the game client over the holidays!

It's been a wonderful year, so what better way to send it off than with some artwork of our adorable mascots settling in to enjoy the winter chill?

If you're of an artistic persuasion, now's your time to shine! The intrepid artists of the osu! community have **14 days** to pen any **winter-themed rendition of the osu! official or community mascots**.

As always, all entries will go up for 7 days of voting once submissions close, and a selection of the top-scoring winners will make it into the osu! game client as the Winter 2018 seasonal backgrounds. Their creators will also receive **2 months of osu! supporter** to commemorate their victory.

Interested? Great! Read the rules below to get started (even if you're a veteran, some have changed) - then either click on the banner above, or the link after the big, intimidating wall of text to be whisked off to the contest listing.

## Rules

- **All entries MUST be OBVIOUSLY WINTER THEMED in some way.** If you're not digging the Santa look, anything suitably cold or otherwise quintessentially winter is absolutely fine - it just has to *be* winter at a glance. We leave that up to you to figure out!
- **All entries must be suitable for all-ages viewing.** The osu! mascots might be a real treat to look at, but that should end at 'aww' and not at 'ooh' or 'uh.', if you catch my drift. If you don't catch my drift - don't draw smut. Easy.
- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed on the main menu and during the voting process.** New to these contests or not, these templates still seem to confuse people time after time. Use them to figure out where we'll overlay the osu! cookie during the voting process (and where it'll be if it gets to the main menu) - anything you draw behind the central circle WILL NOT be seen by voters, so keep that in mind!
- **DO NOT LEAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR WORK!** LOUD NOISES! THIS WHOLE SECTION IS IN CAPITAL LETTERS BECAUSE PEOPLE KEEP DOING IT! DO NOT LEAVE THE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR WORK! I'M NOT GOING TO CHASE UP ARTISTS TO ASK THEM ABOUT IT ANYMORE!
- **ACCOUNT FOR THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE IN YOUR WORK!** What we mean by this is that again, everything behind the dotted circle in the template WILL NOT BE SEEN during voting phase. This does NOT mean that you can just leave the space it encompasses blank - only that it WILL NOT BE SEEN during voting phase. If your entry is flat out missing a giant circular chunk in the center, it WILL NOT progress to voting phase to begin with.
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece - namely 2732x1536.** We were really firm about this last contest and we'll continue to be firm about it - CHECK YOUR OUTPUT RESOLUTION BEFORE SUBMITTING!
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK! NO TRACING! NO REDRAWING! NO COMPOSITE WORKS!** Repurposing other people's pre-drawn works to make them look like osu! mascots is just plagiarism, straight up. Don't do it. Using brushes and things like that is fine. Have some respect for yourself and the work of others!
- **Don't use copyrighted characters from other intellectual properties.** You can freely use any of the osu! mascots (pippi, Yuzu, Mocha, Maria) and any of the community mascots (Tama, Aiko, Taikonator, so on), but stay away from using direct representations of characters from other worlds or franchises in your work. Remember that the community mascots are also someone else's creation, so make sure to treat their work with the same respect that you'd treat yours.
