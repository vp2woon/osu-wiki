With a massive selection of 49 liquid-bass tracks from nearly a dozen unique artists, we're proud to announce the latest addition to the Featured Artist roster - **High Tea Music**, complete with a pack of **6** introductory maps from the Mappers' Guild!

Founded by the Dutch drum and bass acts **T & Sugah** and **Zazu**, [**High Tea Music**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/26) is a record label that thrives on the liquid bass scene, sporting accomplished artists such as **High Maintenance, Submatik, Lexurus and L.A.O.S**.

Drum and bass has always held a strong place in the osu! community's heart, from maps like the [**L.A.O.S remix of Our Stolen Theory's United**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/237768), to the osu! World Cup Semifinals pick of [**No More from T & Sugah and Lexurus**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/471562#osu/1007896), and countless others. We're excited to welcome some of the artists behind these iconic tracks into the roster!

Courtesy of the talented folks over at the Mappers' Guild, we also have **6** brand new beatmaps picked from the pool of new tracks for play right now:
