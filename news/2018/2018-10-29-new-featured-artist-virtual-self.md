Exploring sounds both new and old, **Virtual Self** is the brainchild of *Porter Robinson*, a wildly popular American musician fabled for his fusion of electronica, pop music and anime.

Headed by the enigmatic A.I personae of *technic_Angel* and *Pathselector*, **Virtual Self** poises itself as a heavily concept-driven musical project, drawing on icons, sounds and themes from the early 90's, 00's and more, all set to the visual overload of a high-tech and futuristic aesthetic.

There is much that we're still discovering about **Virtual Self**, but one thing is for sure - their tracks *work* for rhythm gaming like you wouldn't believe.

Check them out:

All of the tracks from the self-titled **Virtual Self** EP are now available as Featured Artist tracks, as well as a bonus track *Angel Voices*, a *'technic_Angel'* remix of *Ghost Voices*. As always, these maps (and their included videos) are 100% free for use in osu! mapping projects. Worry less, and map more!

To celebrate, the organizers of the osu! Mapping Olympiad have organized a special concept-based beatmapping contest.

In the spirit of what **Virtual Self** represents, this special beatmapping contest will require entrants to create **two beatmaps with differing styles** that both showcase **EON BREAK** as a song.

How you choose to approach this is entirely up to you, and as one cannot hope to cross the first gate alone, entrants are allowed to collaborate with **one** other person for the contest.

The winning entry as judged by the Olympiad team will see both participants awarded with **4 months of osu!supporter, plus a Mapping Olympian badge and the highly-coveted Elite Mapper title**.

Interested? [Head on over to the contest listing to read the rules in depth and find out more!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/72)

We're excited to see what kind of incredible pieces the osu! community can churn out with **Virtual Self's** iconic sound!

As always, keep your eyes and ears peeled for future developments surrounding the Featured Artist project, since this is only the tip of the iceberg after all!
