A departure from the norm, this time we've got two brand new artists to share with you. Each one currently has **four** tracks available on their listing, for a total of eight new tracks altogether.

Let's dive right in!

## antiPLUR

A memorable name for some of our older players, **antiPLUR** came to the attention of the osu! community in 2015 with his track *Speed of Link*, which proceeded to blow everybody's minds.

Taking a distinctly unique twist on classic 8-bit console sounds, **antiPLUR**'s work tends to be blisteringly quick and incredibly catchy, posing itself as excellent fuel for the endless fires of higher-level play.

Check out a brief preview of the **four** tracks we have available from him below, and if you like what you hear, [check out his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/24) for pre-timed beatmap files!

## Nakanojojo

Bursting into the osu! scene earlier this year with a [joint artist-mapper collaboration](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/700384), **Nakanojojo**'s work highlights perhaps one of a very small number of times in osu!'s decade-long history where the creators of a track and beatmap have worked closely together to create something entirely new and wonderful.

A slightly slower-paced take on the the traditional anime-inspired sound, **Nakanojojo**'s pieces are often airy and vocal, featuring his signature breath-y lyrics set to a sound harnessed and honed by some of the eminent names in Japanese music production.

Don't take my word for it, check out a sample from each of the **four** tracks we now have available on [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/25):

### Bittersweet (feat. Kuishinboakachan a.k.a Kiato) (Game Mix)

As with all Featured Artist releases, these new tracks are 100% free for use in creating osu! beatmaps, so worry less, and map more!

We're excited to keep expanding the Featured Artist roster with a variety of sounds and styles, and the astute among you may have already noticed a few hints as to where the future leads in that regard.

We'll say only this much - the next release is bound to be *very* delightful.
