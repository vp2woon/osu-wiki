[toby fox - Undertale Boss Themes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/389467) by [Arphimigon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5392762)\
*written by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

If you love Undertale, or even just its soundtrack, you're sure to love this mapset; many people already do, with it currently having a whopping 713 favorites at the time of writing this! Arphimigon created a mapset of this nearly 22-minute compilation of ten different boss themes for all kinds of players to enjoy. The mapset has two different difficulties: a high-2\* version for beginners and a high-6\* version for the highly adept. Even if you're currently unable to enjoy the top difficulty, feel free to appreciate the lower difficulty while you refine your circle clicking mechanics!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-12-project-loved-week-of-august-12th/osu/alone.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/788665)

[Marshmello - Alone](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/461509) by [Zer0-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4260033)\
*written by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

A bit of a break from the high-star madness, this popular mapset by Zer0-, sitting at over 650 favorites, features two maps—one Hard difficulty and one Insane difficulty—of a catchy trap song by Marshmello. Both maps feature consistent jumpy rhythm to match the jumpy feel of the song. The song clocks in at a solid 4 minutes and 33 seconds, and the Insane difficulty of the set has quite long jump sections, so if you're looking to work on basic raw aim consistency, this is the map for you!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-12-project-loved-week-of-august-12th/osu/i-m-getting-married-to-an-anime-girl.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/788666)

[Egor Nuts - I'm getting married to an anime girl](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/745388) by [XenjeS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10166905), [dima21](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8185954), [edgar456](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11510199) and [TmacBoris](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7815424)\
*written by [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689)*

It's been a bit surprising watching this mapset soar up in favorite counts from when it was first submitted for Loved. Currently sitting at over 435 favorites, this Russian song is about a tragic love. A son is apologizing to his mother that he is marrying an anime girl. If that's not the kind of gut-wrenching drama you expect from Loved, there's not much here for you. Each difficulty is by a different mapper, including dima21, edgar456 and TmacBoris. Enjoy the spread of this quickly-rising jump mapset!

[Lime - smiling](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/450363) by [elchxyrlia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1722835)\
*written by [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689)*

It's come to the point that lahphnya (now known as elchxyrlia) might be the most famous mapper without a ranked map or guest difficulty. They're known for their consistent stream of high level graveyard maps for top players to challenge themselves on. Smiling is no different. Featuring 9\* spaced streams and jumps, it may be one of the most challenging, yet tantalizingly FCable 9\* maps out there. Now, this sped up version of Lime's song has collected over 280 favorites, and it's likely to see much more if it enters Loved.

*written by [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689)*

You may know this mapset possibly only because of that crazy clip of [firebat92](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1777162) FCing the shorter difficulty (check it out [here](https://clips.twitch.tv/ChillyDaintyIguanaEleGiggle) if you haven't seen it)—since then, the map has collected over 350 favorites and is now a staple for people wanting to train their 8\* jump patterns, as this map features a couple long 300x 8\* jump sections at 252 BPM. Good luck in overcoming your own monsters here!

## osu!taiko

osu!taiko Loved candidates were chosen by [Backfire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/263110), [Gezoda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/481582), [iceOC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5482401) and [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)!

Perthed Again has grown into a fan favorite over the years as a song, and it's no doubt in part because of this mapset, which features a lot of relatively obscure taiko mappers, alongside the legend tasuke912, whose difficulty was featured in the first iteration of [Taiko LMS:SE](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/366482). It has a lot of diverse types of mapping throughout the set, and it has remained a favorite of the Japanese osu!taiko community over the years.

[xi - Glorious Crown](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/635497) by [iloveyou4ever](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4964596)

-Kazu-, our new captain, deemed this the "xi version of [PEPPY FIX TAIKO STAR RATING PLEASE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/794048)" due to its mashup nature of songs that osu! players will be familiar with, in this case Freedom Dive and Glorious Crown. This map features comfortable patterns and small streams, and it's sure to be fun if you're up for the challenge! We urge everyone to check this map out.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-12-project-loved-week-of-august-12th/taiko/cafe-de-kemomimi-loli.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/788673)

[katagiri - cafe de kemomimi loli](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/792135) by [Soukun1shiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10196449) and [KitajimaYN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2250574)

A personal favorite of mine, and a clear hidden gem of mapping that's came out this year, cafe de kemomimi loli stands tall as not only one of the most enjoyable maps, but also songs of the year. This breakcore track features musical cameos from artists like Morimori Atsushi and even osu!'s very own "dark cat" around the 2:15 mark! This fun but gritty track gets nailed in the mapping department, with two very intense but rhythmically different difficulties from newcomer Soukun1shiki and veteran KitajimaYN. The background is also a nice touch, as it's personally illustrated by Soukun!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-12-project-loved-week-of-august-12th/taiko/soutou-no-rei.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/788674)

[Kaitendaentai - Soutou no Rei](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/750306) by [yea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6874332)

A huge fan-favorite and the 3rd breakcore track of the week (lol), Soutou no Rei may be familiar to those of you who watched this year's osu!taiko World Cup. The "Reassurance" difficulty was featured as a NoMod pick in semi-finals, which is the easier of the two diffs, while the "Disappearance" difficulty is the first of yea's series, which features intense, incredibly difficult maps and high bpm songs, which you can check out on their profile. This one has however, inched out the other two! We hope you enjoy the map, and don't get too discouraged by this extremely expert-level mapset!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-12-project-loved-week-of-august-12th/taiko/pon-pon-pompoko-dai-sen-saw.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/788675)

[kuroma - Pon-Pon-Pompoko Dai-Sen-Saw!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/338578) by [-xNaCLx-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1530993)

A returning choice from Round 3 of Project Loved, this map was featured in the old voting system where it barely didn't make the cut. As such, we'll use the description we used from back then as well!

> Featured in osu!taiko World Cup 2017 as a FreeMod pick, a lot of pros are probably familiar with this map, and also, no doubt have a love-hate relationship with its blistering difficulty. The 1/6 is intense but also fitting, as NaCL's veteran use of these kinds of patterns no doubt flourish in this song.

## osu!catch

[ExileLord - Soulless 4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/772138) by [Kyptoric](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1361268)

This week, we have Kyptoric making his way into the Project Loved vote with his big boy map Soulless 4. With the ridiculous length of 12:22 and maybe even more ridiculous star rating of 11.51, Soulless 4 makes for a map only accessible to the very best of the osu!catch community. Passing this map is a close to impossible task, but even still, when played with NoFail, this map can prove to be a very valuable practice map thanks to its variety in patterns, primarily consisting of streams, some quick left rights, and lots of micromovement. All in all, it's a crazy map only for the craziest of players.

[Abecky - Vampire Edge](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/433672) by [ursa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/321063)

It has been a while since the osu!catch Loved vote has seen some metal, but today ursa will be providing us with four difficulties of metal on Abecky's Vampire Edge. What can be considered as a relatively long song for a spread, it being 4:30, Vampire Edge provides some nice material to people of any skill level, with a Salad, Platter, Rain and Overdose included. Although Vampire Edge is not the greatest challenge of a map for good players, it still provides plenty of replayability when attempted with a variety of mods across its spread. You can make it a little spicier yourself by trying the Rain with DoubleTime, for example. So get your horns out, headbang some to this map, and vote!

[DragonForce - ULTRA BEATDOWN SUPREME](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/728851) by [IcyWorld](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1383951)\
*written by [Pope Gadget](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2288341)*

Holy heck, Icy made something spicy! This is a renowned Stepmania classic made more than seven years ago, but it still holds up interest today—a massive amalgamation of several DragonForce tracks charted in Icy's typical fun fashion. This was originally brought to the mania community as a convert back in 2014 from [Pichu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2521046) (which has since garnered over 30 favourites), but Icy has been so kind as to upload this onto his own account, such that the no converts rule could be overridden. Enjoy!

[Function Phantom - Euclid](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/658097) by [juankristal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/443656) and [XeoStyle](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3377280)\
*written by [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750)*

What happens when a long note specialist joins forces with a metalhead? You get Euclid by Function Phantom (who is, by the way, one of osu! featured artists), a map both brutal and fascinating.

A collab between juankristal and XeoStyle, this chart is a release heaven, which makes it both loved and hated. Its trademark patterns involve 3-note chords with each note being released separately as well as less dense sections which focus more on finger independency. Although not as hard to fullcombo as other long note oriented maps, Euclid is notably difficult to get a good accuracy on, especially because of a high OD setting (for a LN map). Because of its popularity and how well this chart is executed, we hope it will be well perceived in the Loved section!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-12-project-loved-week-of-august-12th/mania/ninja-re-bang-bang.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/788689)

[Kyary Pamyu Pamyu - Ninja Re Bang Bang](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/372942) by [ecafree2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1984442)\
*written by [TheToaphster](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811)*

Continuing on, we introduce ecafree2 to the Loved section with his chart for Ninja Re Bang Bang, a chart that has seemingly simple intentions at first glance, but hides a secret midway through that will certainly surprise anyone not expecting anything out of the ordinary. Transitioning out of the first chorus, the player is thrown into a 0.25x slow jam that for many players will have the notes too close together to effectively read, but ecafree2 compensates the player with how simple the rhythm and patterning is, allowing for an understanding of the section without too much learning. This novelty and the execution of it, surprising the player, as well as the popularity it has amassed for this reason gives it a good shot for the Loved section.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-12-project-loved-week-of-august-12th/mania/second-run-core-mix.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/788690)

[Nauts - Second Run (Core Mix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/504091) by [Reba](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3087654) and [Wonki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7898495)\
*written by [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750)*

Reba is known for his simple and effective long note style, and Second Run by Nauts is probably one of the best examples of his mapping proficiency. This mapset was a part of osu!mania 7K World Cup finals map pool.

This is one of these maps which don't have any special trick or feature—their main goal is to be just a pleasant, fun experience. With each difficulty, the amount of long notes gradually increases, and they are very rewarding to hit thanks to comfortable patterning. The hardest difficulty introduces higher density with a hefty amount of shields which are a good practice for noodle lovers. We are sure you will love this pick!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-12-project-loved-week-of-august-12th/mania/grayed-out-antifront.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/788691)

[Getty vs. DJ DiA - Grayed Out -Antifront-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/526356) by [MEGAtive](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3094101) et al.\
*written by [Kamikaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783)*

Our next pick is a behemoth of a mapset. MEGAtive's Grayed Out -Antifront- is a mapset with 5 key modes and a difficulty spread ranging from beginner-friendly low difficulties to really challenging Black Anothers, containing **25 separate difficulties!** MEGAtive himself mapped seventeen of those difficulties, and he features guest difficulties from various befriended charters; especially prominent are the two top 8K difficulties made by ajeemaniz (now known as Arzenvald), which are extremely challenging but really fun to play, which can also be said about rest of the top difficulties.

This mapset has been very popular ever since it was uploaded. It's very accessible for all kinds of players, and I believe it would be a good addition to the Loved category!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-12-project-loved-week-of-august-12th/mania/black-lotus.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/788692)

[wa. - Black lotus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/679321) by [Rain-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6747917)\
*written by [aitor98](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3154852)*

The next map in the list goes by the name of Black Lotus, and it's made by Rain-. This high-level map features many dense chordstreams coming at 200 BPM, followed by some nasty bursts after every section, and they are not comfortable at all. Another thing to point out would be how stamina draining this map can be. Even though this map is not even two minutes long, it does have a few nonstop chordstream sections that can last up to twenty seconds. That might not seem like much, but given the density of the chart and the high OD, it can become a real challenge. Rain- has already managed to get [a mapset](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/538667) into into the Loved section, and he definitely deserves a chance to get this one in as well!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-08-12-project-loved-week-of-august-12th/mania/madpakke.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/788693)

*written by [Kamikaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783)*

We're finishing the list with a bit of a classic. Madpakke is a mapset that's been going around since forever, a 4&7K mapset with 4K difficulties made by \[ C r a c k \] and 7K difficulties made by richardfeder and Kuo Kyoka. This set is interesting, as it takes the song's very unique and dynamic nature and showcases it through its patterning really well.

The mapset has gained a lot of attention through tournaments, especially with the 4K Another difficulty being featured in the Springtime osu!mania Tournament and richard's 7K Another being featured in osu!mania 7K World Cup 2016. It has retained its popularity throughout the years, and we believe that it's a very good candidate for the Loved section!
