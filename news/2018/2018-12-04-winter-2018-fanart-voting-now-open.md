Head on over to [the contest listing page](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/73), and go vote! There's only **6 days** before the gifts will be unwrapped on the main menu for everybody to see.

A choice selection of the top winning entries will be featured in the osu! game client as the Winter 2018 seasonal backgrounds, and their artists will receive **2 months of osu!supporter** to celebrate their victory.

We've prepared a short preview of the entries in the running this time around, all set to the smooth masterpiece that is [nekodex's](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/1) *aureole*, the Christmas spin on the osu! theme released last year:
