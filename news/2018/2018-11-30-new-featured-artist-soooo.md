The Featured Artist project storms into the sounds of a turbulent youth with the latest addition to the roster, **SOOOO!**

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/30/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/30)

First popularized on osu! following the tremendous success of their track *Happppy song*, **SOOOO** is an enigmatic Japanese Vocaloid producer that thrives on an unusual subversion of the classical poppy, sweet-tinged sound in favor of a more intense, experimental, and ultimately sinister twist.

Dense, intimidating and full of musical influences from heavier genres, **SOOOO**'s sound is not for the faint of heart in many regards - mapping included.

Are you brave enough?

Check out a sample of what we have available:

### Happppy song

*Made popular by [Kuron-kun's mapset](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/744593#osu/1569904), this is where SOOOO all began in osu!.*

All the tracks listed above are available now from [**SOOOO**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/30), fully timed and ready for mapping.

As always with Featured Artist works, these works are 100% free for use in osu! for modding and mapping, so worry less and map more!

We look forward to seeing what you guys make of (and with) **SOOOO**'s sound. If Vocaloid isn't your thing, keep an eye out for more upcoming artist releases over December!
