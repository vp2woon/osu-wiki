Have you ever opened up the editor and just looked at everything it offers in confusion? Do you have no idea where to even begin beatmapping? Worry no further, the Community Mentorship Program might be the place for you!

There are so many things to learn about beatmapping and the most difficult part is getting started, especially if you're on your own.

But you don't have to be tackling this on your own! The Community Mentorship Program pairs experienced mentors with newer mappers for a 10 week cycle to pass on mapping knowledge and expertise in one on one and small group settings.

**For the upcoming spring cycle our mentors are looking for mentees for all game modes!**

The rough timeline for the next cycle is as follows:
- Mentee signups will open on the 28.01.2018 and close on the 07.02.2018.
- The 2018 spring cycle will start on the 11.02.2018 and end on the 22.04.2018.

During this time, the internal organization team will host a variety of events on the discord server, such as mapping contests, modding puzzles [in a similar style to Charles445's](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/334240), or even just things like multiplayer lobbies with integrated feedback sessions!

If any of the above made you curious to find out more, head over to the [forum announcement and rule thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/689250) to read the program's rules and apply!

We're looking forward to seeing a brand new set of mentors and mentees figuring out how to map!
