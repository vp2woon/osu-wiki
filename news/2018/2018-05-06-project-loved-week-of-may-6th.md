Another Sunday marks another [Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) voting on the horizon! Come and vote for your favourite beatmaps nominated from all four game modes!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120)

Hello and welcome to the first [Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) showcase of May 2018! This week contains several exciting picks for every game mode, and has something for both new and old players!

For those of you who are unfamiliar with Project Loved or how the new system works, each mode has "captains" who pick a selection of your submissions to be put up for vote every two weeks. These chosen selections are each given their own community poll, and any beatmaps with an approval rating above 75% for osu!standard and osu!taiko or 80% for osu!catch and osu!mania are moved into the Loved category after a week's time. Beatmaps that are Loved have leaderboards, but do not award performance points (much like Qualified maps).

If you'd like to vote for any of the beatmaps in this week's selection, just click the map's header image and it'll lead you to the poll!

If you'd like to help out and submit beatmaps *you* love to be considered for the Loved category, please use this [submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbgHOVqMF8wQQKSdddW1JhC10ff6C7fb4JbEW7PBQTn9gAqg/viewform)!

Unfortunately, there won't be any videos this week; our regular video producer has been busy with school and exams. There will be videos next time, we promise!

With a staggering 791 favourites, [Moway](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1352672)'s [Fukagyaku Replace](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/227021) is insanely popular, and it's easy to see why. The mapset is incredibly clean, featuring an easily rankable spread of difficulties by several notable mappers and a top difficulty which has been featured in too many tournaments to count. Hopefully this beloved map can finally receive the scoreboard it deserves through Loved!

[Canon Rock](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/203734) is a mapset hosted by mania mapper [momo1101](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4220343) that features high quality difficulties for all 4 modes. It's clear that a tremendous amount of work has gone into this mapset based on the thread, and the 200 people who have favorited the map are a testament to the appeal of the map. With a full spread for standard including a notable extra by the mapper previously known as [Fort](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2805457), you're sure to find some enjoyment here, no matter your skill level!

Hailing from the 2103/2014 era, this 5\* map has distance snap written all over it. Though [GoldenWolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1612624) now may be known for some higher starred Demetori marathons, this set remains highly popular with 215 favorites despite being a little rougher around the edges compared to his current productions. Though the three-diff set may seem somewhat standard in today's mapping meta, its place in the Loved category would be fair considering its permanence within the community, even sneaking its way into some recent tournament mappools.

Quite possibly the "old map set to end old map sets", this MASSIVE collaboration by [RemmyX25](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/612) from 2009 features some of the most prolific names from that mapping era. Those familiar with maps predating 2010 will recognize names such as [Hitoshirenu Shourai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/602), [Larto](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12328), [Starrodkirby86](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/410) and so many more! It truly is an authentic experience for anyone who hails by the older mapping style.

Once again, a map that has can possibly attribute a part of its popularity to top player livestreams, [Lortus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1008962)'s [Shoujo to Ougonryuu no Monogatari](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/357361) has a quite infamous slider velocity change that has been known to break combos as featured in a popular clip from [Azer's channel](https://clips.twitch.tv/FurryStupidOysterSoonerLater). Since then, the map has amassed nearly 200 favorites since 2015 and has been used in tournament mappools to further bolster its track record. The large jumps fully encapture the booming sounds within the song and make for an experience that feel truly rewarding when hit perfectly.

The biggest anime plot twist of 2018 arrived in the form of well-versed tournament player and mapper [Shirasaka Koume](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3062998) openly admitted to also be the owner of the now restricted account Roll\_Pan. The once faceless graveyard mapper can now be properly credited for their extremely popular mapsets, with [Maid-chan yori](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/369623) being among them. The single difficulty GD from [Koume](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3062998) has become somewhat of a cult classic, garnering 170+ favorites since 2015 and achieving widespread popularity among players and tournament mappoolers alike.

Welcoming back a mapper already familiar with the Loved category, [Snow Note](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/643394) still has a trick or two up their sleeve with [Capriccio of My Mind](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/107475). The 78 favorites don't do the map justice to its overarching popularity as a mapset, being one of the most popular stream maps from 2013. Recently it's seen a resurgance in popularity after being featured in a few popular tournament mappools. This map is truly as classic as a map can get.

[Flashes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/512648) is a masterful map by the master himself, [Skystar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/873961). The top diff was the winner of Pending Cup 4, a very highly regarded Chinese mapping contest, and it's incredibly clear why: the crisp, inventive patterns and genius use of 2B elements put this map in a league of its own. If you've never seen this mapset before, I implore you to check it out because you're definitely missing out!

The map features winding streams that are sure to still pose a threat to the players of today, as well as plenty of classic symmetry-based patterning.

MariannE sounds like a familiar name in the Loved section, right? Well, [yes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/521862). This is a fast-paced challenge that will require focus at all times. It's a collaboration between [Gezoda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/481582), [Mew104](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2345156) and [katacheh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6651672), each providing their own gimmicks! Now known as Yukiko's Challenge, this thing will either make you yell in triangles, or just label every mod that ever shows up as banned/illegal. To those who are coming for the full combo, we hope you still remembered that this isn't Taiko anymore!

Ranging from traditional Japanese instruments to more western kick drums, and without forgetting the infamous banging noise from SOUND VOLTEX, this beatmap is a delight to the ears!

[Mermaid Girl](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/55126) is a map from the olden times where osu!taiko mapsets weren't even rankable, and it's a time capsule itself! This is a relic of the distant past, telling us how mapping was, and how it evolved to be what we know today. It is really difficult to realize that without giving it a try, so go play it as soon as you can!

[Sayonara Matane](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/351574) is simply a beautiful map. An incredibly polished map that combines 1/4 and 1/6 extremely seamlessly, this is one of the few 1/6 heavy maps that never feels forced, and consistently feels satisfying once you learn how to play it. The epic combination of t+pazolite and COMP feels really organic as well; hopefully this map exposes the community to this amazing song mapped by [tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767)!

Ya' know, music producers in the Taiko Community are few and far between, but boy are we lucky to have [Sayaka-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/398275). This map was most recently featured in TWC 2018 as the semi-finals tiebreaker, and the players could easily tell you, this map is a doozy of difficulty.

However, don't let the underwhelming title fool you, B is most certainly an overwhelm to the senses. At 280BPM and filled to the brim with difficult patterns, this is one of [yea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6874332)'s most exciting maps yet.

[YUKARI](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/462829) is brought by one of our former Beatmap Nominators [Hareimu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4138746). It's a single difficulty beatmap rated over 9 stars, but don't be fooled by its high star rating, since the intuitive way most of the hyperdashes flow makes it accessible for most of our experienced players. Its mixture of oriental music with some touches of dubstep/drumstep and the high snapped jumps make this beatmap a quite interesting alternative to the meta patterns we're used to see in most Overdose-like difficulties.

[Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)'s [Sampling Paradise](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/484283) bears some similarities to one of my previous picks, [Pizza Rolls](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/246497), in that there's a vast array of musical diversity to enjoy throughout. However, what say you if this round's pick offered up three times more drain and an even more variety in patterns and flow? From snapping, fast-paced hooks to calmer, slider-focused melody sections, this is a beatmap that perfectly treads the line between challenging and fair, nostalgic yet clean---there's really certainly something for everyone on offer here for most players. Do I have everybody's attention now?

[PLASTIK DANCEFLOOR](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/74459) is a typical [Drafura](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/326099) map pattern-wise, but has the unusual AR of 10 with a circle size of 3, which very little of Drafura's maps have. For its time back in 2013, this map was actually quite modern and tough for the majority of players, but with today's playerbase this is quite accessible. This map can also be very enjoyable with HardRock due to the fact that it only really changes the circle size. PLASTIK DANCEFLOOR has some fun snapping between streams and also some fancy left-rights which feel very satisfying to hit.

Overall, the maps are frankly quite generic without any sort of special tinkering to them. They are, however, all very polished and still fun to play, hence why the map has been used in various tournaments throughout its lifetime. If you have a heart filled with determination for -Plus- and his great works, then consider voting!

When you read [ZHSteven](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/142413), you know it is going to be hard in some way. His map for [L](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/233454) specifically is unique in its own way. Old-style left-right patterns paired with CS5 is not what you see everyday, especially not with this length. The difficulty name Hand - Breaking isn't there just for show; due to the unusual movements and left-rights, it drains your stamina over the time, making it really hard to consistently hit these patterns in the later part of the map. The fact that a lot of the distances are really tight doesn't help either. Getting close to an FC would already be considered amazing given how much of a challenge this map is.

*written by [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707)*

The catalyst for XeoStyle's full-album project, [The Parallax II: Future Sequence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/682489), we are nominating Phil's progressive metal epic, [Telos](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/609826). If you enjoyed XeoStyle's 1-hour marathon but wanted a more compact version of it, this chart will be right up your alley.

The Telos chart in XeoStyle's marathon is actually a toned down version of this chart (this was done to prevent the chart from skewing the difficulty curve of the marathon too much). [Phil](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3191489)'s unfettered chart is aggressive and compelling, but pensive and meticulous in many other sections. Blisteringly fast trills, fast-paced jumpgluts, long shrill jumpstreams, solemn slow PR'd sections, those are a few things that you will find in this progressive epic. In my eyes, while [Phil](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3191489)'s chart might not be quite as ambitious as [XeoStyle](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3377280)'s full album marathon, the chart itself encompasses what is required for a progressive marathon chart to be considered memorable. That memorability is what makes it stand out from other marathon charts, and it is what makes this chart a viable nominee for the Loved section.

[9mm Parabellum Bullet - Punishment](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/532682) by [Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082)\
*written by [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707)*

If you were to ask me for the absolute most frenzied and aggressive chart that I can think of, it would be [Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082)'s chart for [Punishment](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/532682). To call it intense is an understatement; the song itself is among 9mm Parabellum Bullet's most adrenaline-filled (who has multiple other frenzied songs to their name), and [Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082)'s approach to this chart encompasses the frenzied nature of the track with a sense of grittiness that is practically irreplicable with a cleaner approach.

The chart starts by kicking your face in with cutthroat 1/6 bursts at 212BPM, and the pace of the chart does not let up from there. The pace is even accelerated in some sections with long patches of super dense jumpstream and continuous 1/5 to 1/6 streaming. The chart ends with a continuous 1/6 stream with fast and messy polyrhythms, which captures the grittiness of the song beautifully.

Like [Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082)'s other Loved charts, while this may not be [Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082)'s most technically sound chart, it is one of his most memorable. There are not many songs that are as intense as Punishment that are charted for osu!mania, and [Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082) did a fantastic job in capturing that level of intensity that Punishment provides. It most certainly helps that the chart itself is excellent and is already played in competitive circles as well.

[Soleily - Renatus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/235827) by [Fullerene-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2531335), [LordRaika](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3265023), [arcwinolivirus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2039089) and [Kamikaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783)\
*written by [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707) and [Kamikaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783)*

Greatly overlooked due to its notable reserve, [Fullerene](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2894788)'s chart for [Renatus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/235827) is one of Fullerene's best charts. It doesn't quite have the same panache as his other Loved charts such as [dreamless wanderer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/321347/#mania/714878) or [PEACE BREAKER](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/352754#mania/777348), but the 4K mapset shows a command of the fundamentals that is practically never seen in both the Loved section and the Ranked section. The 4K Insane difficulty is also a chart that is played in several competitive circles today.

The top two difficulties for the 4K mapset are about as conventional as you can get; it has standard layering, good use of PR, tasteful (but subtle) SV usage, and the structure of the chart follows a track that is catchy and progressive. Like mentioned earlier, what makes the 4K mapset stand out is the command of the fundamentals. The patterning in the highest two difficulties are excellent - it is very musically relevant with strong use of repetition and similar patterning and excellent use of pitch relevance.

The 7K mapset, mapped by [LordRaika](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3265023) are charted with some creative and fun ideas like 1/4 LN streams to the synths, it has (similarly to the 4K mapset) tasteful and simplistic SV usage and pretty complex layering in higher difficulties where you can clearly see the difficulty progression throughout. Mixing the LN style and streams with some dense buildups, tricky bursts, finger independence heavy patterning and even a section of inverse in the break. It's a very nicely mixed package which doesn't get boring.

[Danny Baranowsky - The Battle of Lil' Slugger (Ch 1 Boss Extended Cut) (250bpm)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/79839) by [Staiain](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/86188) and [samurai7694](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1033229)\
*written by [Kamikaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783)*

Up next we have a classic chart from the hands of the resident speed demon viking [Staiain](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/86188) and legendary American StepMania player [samurai7694](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1033229), and it is a hard one.

Starting out fairly tame, the chart slowly introduces what it's going to be about with short bursts of 250BPM streams and then a longer 375BPM stream which is the meat of the chart. It's fairly lenient patterning for singlestreams but clocking at whooping 375BPM and runs of semi-dense jumpstream at 250BPM for the most part. The speed factor is why this chart has been very popular both on SM and osu!mania for a very long time, and as such, I think it deserves its spot in the Loved category!

[Niima](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3221985) has been actively mapping osu!mania charts for a considerable amount of years, and we're going to talk about one of them called [Zen Zen Zense by RADWIMPS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/533010). With 70 favourites, this map features Long Notes in its entirety, as well as two different keymodes (4 keys and 7 keys), having such as shields, inverse chordstreams, extremely irregular and fast Long Note chordstreams, and way more that you will find out when you play it.

Even though the Overall Difficulty is set at 0, the patterns are really unfriendly. Definitely something worth enough for Loved.

And now we are presenting a work by a man who goes by many nicknames, ajeemaniz, ExUsagi, Miyamoto Usagi and nowadays known as [Arzenvald](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3027421). A 9K work to that. Here's a song known to pretty much anyone who's played or heard of osu!, [Saiya's Remote Control](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/308297).

This mapset was designed to be beginner-friendly, which shows at lowest difficulties which might as well serve as a tutorial for 9K newcomers from other gamemodes and such, the structure is very clear and basic which makes it great at fulfilling it's role. There are a total of five difficulties in this set, all with respectable differences and gradually getting harder, but not very hard, making it a great mapset to learn how to read 9K, training of finger independence and overall skill, which can be a stepping stone to becoming a legend!

*written by [aitor98](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3154852)*

This time, the set we are going to talk about is made entirely to test the player's skill level accurately. [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737) created this set that goes by the name of [osu!mania 7K Dan Course - Insane Level (Regular)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/450069) to help people see how good they are at certain patterns, specially jacks, mixed patterns, speed and stamina (this set has been recently updated to be more up to date with today's standards). You actually need to achieve an accuracy of 96% or above to be able to move on to the next level, and so on.

In this set there are only four courses that go from 0 to 3, but there are up to fourteen courses (the last three are extra levels) that become way more difficult the further you advance.
