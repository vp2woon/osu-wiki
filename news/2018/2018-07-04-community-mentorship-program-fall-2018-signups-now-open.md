Are you an experienced mapper, or perhaps only recently opened the editor for the first time? Do you like helping others, or are in need of a helping hand in mapping or modding? The Community Mentorship Program has a place for both of you!

If you're new to mapping and don't know where to start for any game mode, this program might be a good way to kickstart your mapping career! Look for a mentor that suits what you want to do and apply for being their mentee - start learning from someone experienced instead of figuring out everything on your own!

Maybe you're a little more experienced and have decided that you want to pass the knowledge you've accumulated about mapping on to someone else and wish to do so in a structured format - the Community Mentorship Program offers a platform for you to do so! Become a mentor for the game mode you are proficient in and get to teaching someone what you know!

**For the upcoming fall cycle we are looking for both mentors and mentees for all game modes!**

The timeline is as follows (all opening and closing dates start and end at midnight):
- Mentor signups will start on 01.07.2018 and close on 08.07.2018.
- Mentee signups will open on 15.07.2018 and close on 25.07.2018.
- The 2018 fall cycle will start on 29.07.2018 and end on 07.10.2018.

During this time, the internal organization team will host a variety of events on the Discord server, such as mapping contests, modding puzzles, or even just things like multiplayer lobbies with integrated feedback sessions! Some mentors also hold lectures from time to time that are accompanied or followed by an open round of questions from the mentees. A compendium of those can be found over at [this thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/514122).

If any of the above made you curious to find out more, head over to the [forum announcement and rule thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/768152) to read the program's rules and apply!

We're looking forward to seeing a brand new set of mentors and mentees figuring out how to map!
