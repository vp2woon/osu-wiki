We're happy to announce the arrival of a beatmapping contest for osu!mania, complete with prizes including the rare appearance of the *Elite Mapper* title. Everyone is welcome to participate; we're looking forward to how you'll try and stand out from the rest!

For those who are unaware, the osu! Mapping Olympiad is a revival of official beatmapping contests, featuring a wide array of competitions ranging from traditional spreads to more unique contests to speedmapping challenges and more!

To kick off osu!mania's first round of the Mapping Olympiad, we'll be adhering to the more traditional and well known style of competition we're all familiar with, but there will be more opportunities for interesting and unique takes in further iterations.

## Song
To kick off the contest, we've picked a song we believe will provide a concrete foundation for a variety of styles, made by one of our featured artists, [**Dictate**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/21)!

Dictate's *Scavenger* is a song with a very unorthodox structure. This masterpiece of oddly syncopated synths and gritty sound is sure to give rise to many experimental interpretations from those expanding beyond the mapping meta.

## Rules
- This contest is for **osu!mania** mode with all rankable key modes (4K-9K) only.
- Each entry must follow the **[Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)**. Entries that break the Ranking Criteria will be subject to penalties ranging from point deductions to disqualification based on severity.
- Beatmap submissions may **not** exceed 15MB.
- Storyboards will **not** be considered in the judging process.
- Custom hitsounds are allowed.
- Your submission must contain a full spread of 3 to 5 difficulties of the same key mode with Normal being the lowest difficulty. We will not strictly enforce the <2.00 star rating limit for the lowest difficulty.
- Collaboration on entries is **not** permitted.
- Maps submitted to the contest must not be uploaded with the Beatmap Submission System (BSS) until the contest is concluded and the winners announced.

## Judging Criteria
- **Musical Relevance (10 pts)**: How well the entry follows the outline of the song through rhythm choices, emphasis, and patterns.
- **Creativity (10 pts)**: How unique and interesting the concepts and themes used are.
- **Technique (10 pts)**: How well executed the ideas present in the entry are.
- **Impression (10 pts)**: The judge's overall impression. How they view the effectiveness of the entry in its entirety.
- **Hitsounding (5 pts)**: How well the entry utilizes hitsounds to add to overall chart expression.

**We are looking for capable judges! If you are interested, please make a post in the [Judging Call Thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/6737869) or send a message to [Protastic101](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/messages/users/6712747). Please be aware that we can only accept people who have the resources (knowledge, time, reliability) to properly judge the entries.**

## Prizes
After the entries are judged and the results are finalized, the top three entries will receive the following prizes:
- **1st place**: 4 months of osu!supporter, 6 Olympiad Points (awards 'Mapping Olympian' Badge), *Elite Mapper* title
- **2nd place**: 3 months of osu!supporter, 4 Olympiad Points
- **3rd place**: 2 months of osu!supporter, 2 Olympiad Points

For Olympiad contests, we will be using a point system to award the 'Mapping Olympian' badge. This means that top placing results across multiple contests will grant you the opportunity to be awarded a badge even if you do not win a particular contest. Every 6 points earned will grant you a badge level, with incrementation on the badge for each level achieved. The expected baseline for points rewards will be 6, 4, and 2 for the top 3 entries respectively, but the specific rewards will vary per contest based on expected effort and challenge for the participants.

You will have 24 days from the date of this post to submit your entries. [Download the pre-timed .osz here.](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/21/osz/Dictate%20-%20Scavenger.osz)
