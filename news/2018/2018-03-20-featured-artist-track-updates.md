## Rin/Function Phantom

We're still hard at work trying to acquire the remainder of Rin's absurdly excellent musical lineup, including tracks from his Ocelot alias and the rest of his Function Phantom works.

For now, we have only **one** track to offer from his Function Phantom alias, but boy, is it a good one!

## Fractal Dreamers

The journey continues on through the soundscapes of the Fractal Dreamers, and we're proud to announce that a selection of tracks from their latest EP, *Everything For A Dream* is now available as a part of this update.

If you've been watching the MWC7K World Cup, you might already be familiar with *Fata Morgana* - as an ending snippet is featured as the 'applause' finisher at the end of each match.

This means **eight** brand new tracks of varying intensity and composition to play around with. [Check out the Fractal Dreamers Featured Artist listing for more information, and download links!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/15)
