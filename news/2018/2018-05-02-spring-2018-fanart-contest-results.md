With 77 entries across a variety of illustration styles, Spring 2018 was perhaps the hardest contest we've ever had the joy of judging. 7 votes was nowhere near enough to showcase the sheer mountains of talent that entered the contest this year, but decisions were made, and votes were cast.

Without further ado, here are the finalists from the 2018 Spring Fanart Contest:

In first place with a whopping **15923** votes is [Sunako](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2801166)'s entry! Featuring all of the main four mascots plus Tama enjoying an evening walk throughout a Japanese-themed festival, this wonderfully captivating work is simple, clean, and absolutely adorable.

It turns out Mocha looks really good in buns, who knew?

Trailing super close in second place with **14251** votes is [In those days](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/777173)'s rendition of a spring-attired Pippi taking a walk among sakura-trees in bloom. Simply spectacular, what more is there to say?

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-02-spring-2018-fanart-contest-results/Leissss.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/64/winners/osu%21%20Spring%20Fanart%202018%20-%20Leissss.jpg)

In third place, [Leissss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4750716)'s stunning entry aimed for the stars and scored **13997** votes, set before two torii upon a starlit plain. Amazing use of perspective and colour really makes the surroundings pop just as much as Pippi and Mocha themselves!

Coming in shortly after with **11675** votes, [Evaine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7295733)'s incredible piece, featuring Alisa from the osu!taiko community mascots is set to a frankly breathtakingly rendered backdrop using some of the best colouring we've ever seen. Absolutely spectacular, well done!

Putting the selfie in spring, [keizami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5402247)'s adorable piece scored **7270** votes, featuring all of the major mascots, and perhaps the first time in a fanart contest where Maria's actually showing her age.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-02-spring-2018-fanart-contest-results/2Su.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/64/winners/osu%21%20Spring%20Fanart%202018%20-%202Su.png)

Saying hello to **6556** votes, [YaoiForeva](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7959038)'s take on Pippi and Maria enjoying some juice and sake respectively before a beautiful blue sky. Twice in one contest where a finalist entry features Maria drinking!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-02-spring-2018-fanart-contest-results/snowyani2000.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/64/winners/osu%21%20Spring%20Fanart%202018%20-%20snowyani2000.jpg)

**5754** is about the number of references in this amazing entry by [snowyani2000](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2691590), scoring the same number of votes. There's so much going on here that we could probably spend an entire article explaining it all.

I also feel compelled to note that the depiction of the osu!team cockpit relates to all of us on a deeply personal level. Excellent entry!
