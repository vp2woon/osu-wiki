Another Monday marks yet another [Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) vote! Come and vote for your favourite beatmaps nominated from all four game modes!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120)

Hello and welcome to the second [Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) showcase of April 2018! This week contains several exciting picks for every game mode, and has something for both new and old players!

For those of you who are unfamiliar with Project Loved or how the new system works, each mode has "captains" who pick a selection of your submissions to be put up for vote every two weeks. These chosen selections are each given their own community poll, and any beatmap with an approval rating above 75% (or 80% for osu!mania) after a week's time is moved into the Loved category. Beatmaps that are Loved have leaderboards, but do not award performance points (much like Qualified maps).

If you'd like to vote for any of the beatmaps in this week's selection, just click the map's header image and it'll lead you to the poll!

If you'd like to help out and submit beatmaps *you* love to be considered for the Loved category, please use this [submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbgHOVqMF8wQQKSdddW1JhC10ff6C7fb4JbEW7PBQTn9gAqg/viewform)!

Once again, [to the beat!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIFsWU-grp6UgGgMm57FiGQ) has created a video for each game mode showcasing our beatmap selections, so if you'd like to see the entries in action, be sure to check out the videos below!

Let's get started!

[Chopin - Revolutionary Etude](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/539300) by [Louis Cyphre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/186243)\
*written by [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689)*

One of the most infamous 9\* maps out there, [Louis Cyphre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/186243)'s extra difficulty originally found in the description of his [ranked set of Revolutionary Etude](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/66350#osu/193647) quickly rose to fame as one of the most popular "impossible" maps on the market. High profile players [Azer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578) and [Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493) also helped boost its popularity through stream highlights of plays on the map. The erratic, geometrically patterned jumble of circles and sliders has since become one of the game's most acclaimed aim tests.

[RLC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1047883)'s [Ultramarine](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/107377) is a classic mapset and tournament staple that was first uploaded in 2013. Featuring a full spread of difficulties from an all star cast of mappers such as [fanzhen0019](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/418699) and [yf_bmp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1243669), every difficulty in this set is wonderful to both play and look at. There's not much to say about this map, other than commenting on just how well executed this whole mapset is!

*written by [Kaifin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596942)*

[heiju-do](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/124905) has been one of my favourite mapsets for the longest time, and I'm so glad it's finally getting its chance to shine! First uploaded in 2013, the top difficulty is a collab between [Liiraye](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1280641) and the notorious [HanzeR](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1592447), and if you didn't know that it'll become incredibly clear once you begin playing the map. Snappy spaced 1/4 patterns, tricky rhythms and challenging flow are used perfectly to represent this glitchy, energetic track.

*written by [Kaifin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596942)*

In one word, I'd describe [Avalanche](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/340048) as gigantic. The set sports 16 difficulties, 8 of which are extras, all mapped by various notable mappers who each bring their own twist to this instantly iconic classical remix from Pump it up Prime. Basically every diff is a hit here, especially [rrtyui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/352328)'s (as should be expected at this point). With over 250 favourites, this is honestly the definitive mapset of Avalanche, and if you haven't checked it out then you're really missing out!

Everything you need to know about [Lyoshka](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/418412) is right there in the tags: "russian jump training." With over 400 favourites, this map has become a sensation since it was uploaded in 2016 due to both the absurdity of the song and the fun factor of the map, which has lead it to be picked in many tournament warmups and multiplayer lobbies. If you're up to the challenge, slap on DT and brave this song about a very, very tragic love!

From the popular Rooster Teeth "anime" RWBY, [LunarFox](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3598090) et al.'s mapset of [Die](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/288824) has grown to immense popularity with nearly 550 favorites as of now. With 9 standard difficulties, there's something here for players of all skill levels. Also check out [puxtu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3070611)'s mania difficulties if you play the mode, as he has a good amount of quality ranked maps and GDs as well.

There's very little to say about [fartownik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/56917)'s [History Maker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/648310). It's a popular map from Yuri!!! on Ice with 426 favorites. It has some unconventional slidershapes that lead up to the kiai. Just play it.

[MEGALOVANIA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/375201) is an incredibly iconic song, and with 580 favourites this mapset by [The_CJ](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5342579) has clearly struck a chord with a lot of people as well. Despite the mapset featuring a 9(!!!!!) star difficulty, there still is a relatively reasonable diff spread so Undertale fans can enjoy the map regardless of their osu skill level. The real star of the show in my opinion is the storyboard, which uses elaborate and complex effects to accompany the song very well.

Here's a map looking for redemption as it was put up for vote back in January of 2017 for Loved Community Vote #4. Sitting at over 400 favorites now, [\[ Another \]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3416573)'s [Maradjatok Gyerekek](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/327265) is deserving of another shot. The aptly named \[Triangle\] difficulty features large patterned jumps, as well as a whole host of triangular patterns. If you love rotating jump patterns, this map is just for you.

This time, featuring a full set with 250+ favorites along with guest difficulties from [RLC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1047883), [Enon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2043401), and [Beomsan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3626063), this 4 minute 225 BPM stream behemoth will leave you reeling.

Mah-do, Mah-do, Mah-do-payee!!!! No one can deny this song's catchiness, but I do recommend that players don't go out and search up what this song's lyrics are talking about, nor what a "Mudpie" really is. Anyway, [YOUTA](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4909860) has brought together an awesome set with a couple awesome guests in [KinomiCandy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/375143) and KitajimaYA, the former who is known especially for mapping YUC'e songs! Some slight SV stuff, but mostly straight-forward, these diffs are for the "all-around" types of players!

You know how people always say to respect their elders for they have lived through the more dire of times? [Volar](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/50932) is that to our Algebras or Lucents, the Taiko storyboard map granddaddy. Sure, it may not be as impressive now that crazier things exist, but it's still a piece of history no one should ignore! [Yoyo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/31060) is really the precursor to an alternative way to play Taiko, and you should give them props!

Another goreshit map from [SKSalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3280542), similar to the also Loved map ["Bad Habits"](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/450569/#taiko/966645) not only in BPM but mapping style, this map is a throw-back to a pretty simple time in osu!taiko's history, one where mapping was 1/4 and stamina focused. This map can induce a lot of nostalgia for those players around that time, especially due to the lack of 1/6 or 1/8. A criminally underrated outing from [SKSalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3280542)!

One of the more popular entries into the "ll-taiko" series by ll-oscar, [Snow Drive](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/286763) has become a staple in tournaments and multi-player lobbies alike, a great stamina and stream map for newer players to get introduced to some of the more fast BPM styles of maps that ll-oscar is very much known for. It's very straightforward and another map that lacks much 1/6 at all, outside of small bursts, so this should be another fun one for most players to compete on!

Much like the other Loved set by [\[\_Chichinya\_\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2140739), [TSLove](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/549370#osu/1251844), [Oshama Scramble](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/360838) smashes as many difficulties as possible to accommodate for as many playstyles and players there are out there. With over 70 favorites, it was more of an inevitability that this "All-Mode" set would eventually find it's way to Loved, and hopefully people enjoy what it has to offer!

[Chambarising](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/517258) is a map both by [Fantazy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6890639) and [katacheh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6651672) that would definitely be in the more tame side of their work, but still manages to pull off tricks on you. Starting of fairly normally, the map then starts using SV gimmicks, 1/8, double spinners, and goes all the way up to ninja kats! The real difficulty resides in staying consistent at all time rather than the map testing your reading ability.

One of the most special maps in the list, this is our first Spanish song for Taiko's Loved section, and by Daddy Yankee of Despacito fame no less! But don't let the song distract you, this map has it all. A blisteringly high BPM, SV tricks, and lots of streams and awesome patterns. [Myckoll](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/554976) is a newer mapper that has a lot of gems in his arsenal as well, so I encourage you if you like this one to check out some of his other maps!

I think that at this point of time quite a handful of you reading this have already heard of [Kuzino's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/158552) maps, specifically the ones with either ''2Q'' or ''4Q'' as difficulty name. This is one of [Kuzino's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/158552) lesser popular maps, but it is exactly something you would expect coming from him. This map is close to 7 years old, which means the playing style is completely different from the current meta, but darn is it a tough map to full combo. With numerous big spacings, unconventional left-right patterns and even a few pixels this map is quite the challenge for even the best, so definitely don't be fooled by it's star rating!

[lolinternetcatgirls.flp](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/57310) has gone quite a long way since it's release in 2012. Widely popular back in the day you would see this map get picked in many multiplayer lobbies, but over time this map was forgotten. Here it is once again though, making it's return to the loved vote round! This map is mostly compiled of old patterns, which aren't the most difficult, but also definitely not rookie-friendly. But really, primarily you play this map for the fun of it, because catgirls! :3

[Crystallized](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/440722) is one of [\[224\]Hyperw7's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4158549) most succesful maps, having seen lots of play around the time of it's release. Once the hype dimmed down, this otherwise very interesting map wouldn't get as played often anymore next to some solo-player practice. [Crystallized](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/440722) is definitely one hell of a practice map though, with extremely difficult and fast left-right wiggle patterns, stairs and jumps even the strongest of players struggle quite immensely passing this map, let alone pulling off a full combo. So if you are a fan of the finger breaking type of stuff, this is a major go.

[\_Asriel's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276) [Skill Analyzer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/593633) mapset consists of four different skill tiers, where each tier consists of three songs bundled together as one. The skill tier idea is heavily inspired by the rhythm game Sound Voltex (SDVX).

The tiers in this mapset mostly cater to experienced players because even the lowest tier utilizes Overdose-style mapping. Especially passing the two highest tiers requires the player to have a good reading and good stamina. The set is good for people who constantly like to challenge themselves, especially the highest tier will most likely be a challenge for basically anyone.

By that time he accumulated enough experience to map crazy stuff such as this map and actually make it feel playable but really hard instead of unplayable hence hard.

This map consists of some ridiculously paced left-rights continuously attacking your retina, which serves perfectly for some stamina and consistency training. Test and see if your skills are up to par with this level of a map, and then come back with your voting decision!

[Yuuyu - Scrap Syndrome](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/663256) by [Halogen-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/169992)\
*written by [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707)*

Low-key one of the best charters in osu!mania and resident sadist [Halogen-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/169992) gets another merciless chart onto the Loved nomination table with [Scrap Syndrome](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/663256). While this chart was made specifically as an mixed pick for the finals stage of MWC 4K 2017, the chart itself stands out as one of the best, if not THE best hyper-technical and all-rounded charts in osu!mania.

Fantastic use of repetition, (primarily) SVs that accentuate the track than overtake it, meticulous layering and patterning structure, sparing but calculating use of LNs, they are all there. The primary complaint you can make about the chart is that it can be a bit too sadistic in structure, and I would agree with it to some degree, but the cruelty is by design -- and it works **brilliantly**.

While osu!mania has had this shift in charting meta to something more cutting-edge and flashy like SV-heavy charts, LN charts, and super-technical charts, I feel that they tend to march to the beat of their own drums; they end up overshadowing the track itself for charts test specific skills. [Scrap Syndrome](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/663256) stands out for not only being the apex of that charting meta, but also bringing a finesse of musical relevance and cutting-edge approach that is almost never seen in charting today.

In my eyes, and in the eyes of many, this chart is more than qualified to be nominated into the Loved section. There may be more flashy and impressively built charts than [Scrap Syndrome](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/663256), but very few charts do a job of capturing the track while engaging players better.

[DJ Sharpnel - TAKECORE OF YOURSELF](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/480479) by [Wh1teh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2640467)\
*written by [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707)*

A favourite among competitive circles, [TAKECORE OF YOURSELF](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/480479) is among one of [Wh1teh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2640467)'s most played charts in osu!mania. Given the type of chart that [TAKECORE OF YOURSELF](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/480479) is, it is no surprise that it is so popular. With clear inspirations from [IcyWorld](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1383951)'s DJ SHARPNEL stamina-intensive charts, [Wh1teh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2640467) takes it a step further and adds patterning nuance with this chart to capture the ethos of the accompanying track further.

The patterning in this chart is about as good as you can get for charts that are this dense, and it mostly certainly helps that the chart itself, due to its stamina-intensive and straight-forward nature, lends itself to heavy competitive play. What sets this chart from other stamina-oriented charts, beyond the fact that the chart is solid, is that it has 4 sped-up versions of itself in the mapset.

It ranges from the fairly leisurely 183bpm 1.0x chart, to the breakneck and blood-pumping 257bpm 1.4x chart. This makes the mapset more than just a mapset for accuracy players (and lower-level speed/stamina players), but for high level accuracy and speed/stamina players as well. If you are an experienced osu!mania player, you will most certainly be able to find a difficulty (or two!) here that is suitable for you.

[Alon Mor - Epollo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/658681) by [Couil](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6872025)\

Feel the beat. Breakout charter and SV specialist [Couil](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6872025) gets his first nominated chart for the Loved section with [Epollo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/658681). The track itself is a psychedelic experience: nothing feels constant, and you feel the world coming in waves. [Couil](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6872025)'s SV-heavy approach captures this track better than any other non-SV approach can.

The difficulty name describes the chart perfectly, and the chart itself is a great representation of the track itself. The SVs here are visually hypnotic, and you will never make out the rhythms of the chart without, well, feeling the beat. The chart is a wonderful rendition of the track, and while the SV usage can be a touch excessive at points, its excess doesn't feel excessive in the slightest when you're playing through it.

The complementing 7K chart follows the exact same principles and layering approach as the 4K chart -- which makes the 7K chart relatively more sparse than the 4K chart. This could be a plus for some players if they want a slightly more intimate approach.

Here we have [Kagiii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4591324) (formerly known as ExKagii-) who brings us [xi - Hesperides](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/485363), followed by 1 Guest Difficulty made by [AncuL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2449200) and another one by [Ibrahim](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2899823). This map features a good mix between normal and long notes that derives into dense chordstreams with relatively easy Long Notes, as well as a few bursts in most of the intersections throughout the map.

On the other hand, we also have [AncuL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2449200)'s diff that is more Long Note based than any other difficulty in the map which offers variety to the whole set instead of focusing in just one kind of pattern style. This map was also featured in the Quarterfinals mappool of the osu!mania 7K World Cup 2017.

[Various Artists - Piano 7K BMS Pack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/577617) by [silentch](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3344567)\
*written by [Kamikaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707)*

For our next pick, we have a rather special mapset by [silentch](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3344567), a massive pack known as [Piano 7K BMS Pack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/577617). The name gives it away, but it's a collection of keysounded piano versions of more or less popular songs from various sources. The mapset, not being limited by filesize due to no mp3s has an astonishing number of 193 charts! It's a great chart for newcomers to try and learn 7K, and it's a really popular mapset boasting an immense number of 124 favourites at the time of writing. It's great fun and great amount of charts to play in a small package, what more could you ask for?

[yuikonnu - Chikyuu Saigo no Kokuhaku wo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/252901) by [KenZ](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/437945)\
*written by [aitor98](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3154852)*

[Zenonia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/437945) is a pretty known mapper in the 7K community, and this time he shows up with a really Long Note based map that goes by the name of [Chikyuu Saigo no Kokuhaku wo by yuikonnu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/252901).

This map features 2 different keymodes (4K and 7K), and something you will notice about this set at first sight is... LONG NOTES! You could call this a noodle fiesta due to the amount of patterns that it contains. Semi-inverse chordstream, shields, irregular Long Note releases, chordstreams mixed with Long Notes, and way more that makes this a hell of a map. The 7K difficulty was used in the Semifinals mappool of the osu!mania 7K World Cup 2017.

*written by [Kamikaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783)*

And last but not least we have our osu!remix contest [BilliumMoto](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3862471), joining forces with our resident game breaker [Nivrad00](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1984634) to create a BMS chart known as [CuddlePiano](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/413610).

Originally made for Be-Music West event as a GD on [BilliumMoto](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3862471)'s submission, it has been ported by Nivrad onto osu!mania to let us enjoy this joy of a chart. It's a cute piano song with some intricate rhythms and bursts, charted in a friendly but tricky way that makes this chart really interesting and worthy of a spot in the loved category!
