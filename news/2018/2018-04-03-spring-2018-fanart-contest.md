The seasons are changing once again, and that means we get a brand new opportunity for a new seasonal-themed fanart contest!

Spring is in the air, so put some spring in your step and hop over to your trusty drawing implement of choice and get to penning **any of the osu! or community mascots in a spring-themed piece**.

The intrepid artists up for the challenge will find they have **16 days** from the date of this post to pull out their best work for the contest.

All valid entries will be placed up for a big community vote pretty much immediately after entry closes for **7 days of agonizing voting**, and the top ten winners will receive **2 months of osu!supporter** for either themselves, a friend, or two friends.

The top ten winners will also be included as 2018's 'seasonal' background pack for spring, and will remain live in the game client for several weeks - conveniently spanning all of the osu!taiko World Cup! Nice.

If you're planning to enter, **make sure to read the rules below before you begin.** Some have changed a little, as they tend to do from year to year.

## Rules

- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed during the voting process, but they should ABSOLUTELY NOT LEAVE THE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN THEIR FINISHED WORK.** We won't explicitly reject entries if the template is visible so long as the dimensions are correct, but it looks reeeallly bad!
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece - IDEALLY 2732x1536, or 1366x768. Entries that don't meet the resolution requirements exactly will be discarded.** We do a little processing on entries before they hit voting stage, and this processing simply does not work if all entries are not of the same resolution. Please don't have your work lost by not paying attention to this!
- **All entries must be spring themed**. Costume, setting, props - however you do it, it just has to be vaguely spring themed *somehow*. This is a seasonal fanart contest, after all.
- **Submit only your own work! This means NO TRACING! NO REDRAWING!** Please don't be one of *those* people who submit someone else's work. We want to see your best, not the best of pixiv's hottest artist redrawn or traced.
- **Don't use copyrighted characters from other intellectual properties.** You can freely use any of the osu! mascots (pippi, Yuzu, Mocha, Maria) and any of the community mascots (Tama, Aiko, Taikonator, so on), but stay away from using direct representations of characters from other worlds or franchises in your work. Remember that the community mascots are also someone else's creation, so make sure to treat them with the same respect that you'd like your work treated with.

[Got all that? Great! Head on over to the Spring 2018 Fanart Contest listing and enter now!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/64)
