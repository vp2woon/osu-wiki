We're proud to announce a new slew of additions to the Featured Artist catalogue — namely **three** new albums of awesome tracks, one from [\*namirin](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/18), one from [Dictate](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/21), and one from [LukHash](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/12)!

A lot has been going on behind closed doors with the Featured Artist project as of late, and we're super hyped for the next couple of months and also for the very beginning of 2019 as well.

But for now, we have a pretty big drop of new tracks for people to sink their teeth into, so without further ado:

## \*namirin

All of **Koishiteiku Planet (コイシテイク・プラネット)** is now available from \*namirin's Featured Artist listing! Courtesy of her [official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb-crO2ATrJsm253151B4Vg), feast your ears on a short crossfade of what's new:

All five of the tracks from Koishiteiku Planet can be found pre-timed at [*namirin's Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/18), go check them out!

## Dictate

We've nabbed a selection of tracks from Dictate's latest release with Renraku Global Media — **Noclip EP**, namely *Cortex*, *Mitochondrion* and *Pandora*.

Showcasing his neurofunk-inspired high-tech sound, these new tracks are incredibly varied, with *Mitochondrion* standing out as perhaps one of the most rhythmically complex tracks in the Featured Artist collection so far.

If you're after something with a little more grit to map to, check these out:

### Cortex

## LukHash

We've managed to score *all* of LukHash's latest album, [**Ghosts**](https://lukhash.bandcamp.com/album/ghosts), plus three instrumentals to boot! More of his classic electro-chiptune inspired sound, with the appearance of some new vocal talent across a variety of styles!

There are 13 new unique tracks to feast your ears on, so make sure to check out [LukHash's Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/12) for the full suite.

As mentioned at the start of the post, there's a LOT brewing in the depths of the Featured Artist project at the moment, and perhaps more than a few things that you may not expect!

Keep your eyes and ears peeled, and remember — all Featured Artist tracks are 100% free for use in osu!, so worry less and map more!
