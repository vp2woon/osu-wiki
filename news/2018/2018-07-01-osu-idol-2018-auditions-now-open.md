### Hold on, what is this?

The annual community driven singing contest - osu!idol! It's where contestants as a solo or a duet sing their way through multiple stages of different genres with the aim to reach the very top of the idol podium! The panel of judges we have prepared will evaluate your performances and ensure the best is standing at the final stretch. After that, you, the community, can vote to determine who our next osu!idol will be! It's go time!

### What should I do?

All you need to do is make a small recording of around 30 seconds with your best performance without any background music. We'll be taking submissions for a month starting today so there's no need to rush! Practice and make most of your only shot, otherwise you'd have to wait for next year!

### Did anyone say prizes?

After the community voting, the top three contestants will receive supporter tags with a bonus for the winner - the osu!idol winner badge!

- **1st:** osu!idol 2018 Winner profile Badge + 6 months supporter tag.
- **2nd:** 3 months supporter tag.
- **3rd:** 2 months supporter tag.
