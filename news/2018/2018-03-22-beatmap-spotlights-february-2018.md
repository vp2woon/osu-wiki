[Nathan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4785223) has deeply impressed us with his maps for cuteness-combined electronic songs, and this one, YUC'e's "Future Candy", is no exception. Its previous Loved status just illustrates its popularity. Based on varied rhythm patterns, multiple mapping techniques are involved to distinguish one from another, yet the philosophy of consistency remains firmly.

Though technique-heavy, the patterns are neatly organized and vividly express the intensity and complexity of the music. All these elements come together to push the limits of charts of this kind. With a storyboard from [-Tochi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3664366), a highly skilled storyboarder, it undoubtedly deserves the win of this month's Spotlight.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-03-22-beatmap-spotlights-february-2018/kaede.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/660630)

If you were thinking that the mapping styles for electronic songs were getting stale, [Hollow Wings](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/416662) shows that there is still untapped potential out there.

Featuring a track by Ocelot aka Rin, KAEDE's EX EX utilizes reverse sliders to their full extent, including high speed buzzsliders and multiple reverses at less dense timeline gaps.

For those not yet up to the challenge, there's plenty of great difficulties in the set suited for players of any skill level in the set to prepare you.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-03-22-beatmap-spotlights-february-2018/suicide-penguin.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/706545)

With "Suicide Penguin" by Schizoid Lloyd, [BOUYAAA](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/405449) brought us an astonishing experience of marathon length. Due to the progressive nature of the song, the map includes a high variety of unique rhythms and patterns to enjoy, all leading up to a climax near the end.

The mapper found a perfect balance between complexity and playability, don't miss out on this one!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-03-22-beatmap-spotlights-february-2018/fair-wind.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/587541)

For anyone who misses the 2014 mapping, [Zero__wind](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1822830)'s "Fair wind" is sure to give you a nostalgia fix. The top difficulty, mapped by [cRyo\[iceeicee\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/835998) and [xsrsbsns](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/414427), sports a highly improvised rhythm style that matches the high pace of the song quite well.

If you're looking for an aim challenge, the Extra difficulty is a lot easier on the tapping but just as expressive than the top one.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-03-22-beatmap-spotlights-february-2018/escapist.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/604273)

[pw384](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1343783) has a strong affinity towards mapping English rock songs and his map of Nightwish's "Escapist" is his latest addition to the ranked section.

Showcasing highly organized patterns and clear attention to the song's details, this map is an excellent addition to this month's Spotlights!

### osu!taiko

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-03-22-beatmap-spotlights-february-2018/lets-jump.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/688928)

Let's jump in to this month's osu!taiko Spotlight Winner, Camellia's "LET'S JUMP" by the ever so talented [Nishizumi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2496768).

The beauty of this map comes from how the mapper slowly guides the player through the song with simple patterns in the beginning, before introducing several duplet/quadruplet patterns into the mix and then finally building up to an amazing drop in the music that's tastefully accompanied with a string of 1/6+1/4 spaced patterns.

The kiai sections are the highlight of this map, swamping the player with a barrage of dense streams that consistently blends with the flow of the music so well that you might find yourselves jumping along to the rhythm. There are also many SV changes skilfully placed throughout the map to match the music's dynamic tone at several sections, showcasing the mapper's high familiarity with the editor.

For the veteran players that are looking for an extra challenge, the use of the DoubleTime mod is highly encouraged as the overall flow of the map is still smooth as butter in 1.5x speed. Definitely a map that stands out from the rest in this month's Spotlights!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-03-22-beatmap-spotlights-february-2018/destroyer.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/567140)

Coming from no one else but [Nishizumi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2496768), we've got ourselves yet another Inferi song! Ranging from 235 BPM to an astounding 250 BPM, this epic melodic death metal track will keep you on your toes as you Destroy the keyboard through the beautifully crafted deathstreams non-stop.

A combination of masterfully constructed patterns to match the powerful guitar riffs as well as the blast beats present in the song makes this map earn the silver medal in this month's Spotlights!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-03-22-beatmap-spotlights-february-2018/astral-dogma.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/715185)

[Raphalge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3918650) makes his entry into the world of Spotlights this month with a brilliantly executed rendition of Yousei Teikoku's "Astral Dogma". As the song weaves in and out of energetic kiais and instrumental breaks full of drum fills, the map keeps up with its pace, engaging the player at every turn.

Raphalge's mapping is characterized by his more improvised patterning, liberal yet still impactful use of finishers, and major SV changes designed to highlight differences in intensity. This map showcases every aspect of his style yet remains cohesive, producing a playing experience worthy of this month's Spotlights!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-03-22-beatmap-spotlights-february-2018/yolo.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/723229)

[Arrival](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1694000) returns to the monthly spotlights with an amazing map set of lapix's "YOLO"!

The map is noteworthy for its high amount of slider velocity changes, varied mapping and an overall well-done difficulty spread. You can find everything here: tricky 1/8+1/4 combinations, short streams, BPM changes and finishers - even in the Kantan, which is a rare sight. This is definitely a set that you do not want to miss.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-03-22-beatmap-spotlights-february-2018/aimless-voyage.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/679686)

Contrary to the song's name, [Nepuri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6637817) had a clear idea on how he wanted to map LiLA'c Records' song "Aimless Voyage". Playing the Oni or Lost difficulties with any mods will prove difficult, as the slider velocity changes drastically to the vocals.

Overall the patterns used are dense but simple, however the last kiai becomes more complex, with more uncommon patterns (kkkdd for example) used in an excellent manner. First time in the spotlight for the mapper, and a good map to start.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-03-22-beatmap-spotlights-february-2018/invoker.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/351126)

Last but certainly not least, this February we're showcasing this month [Kazu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)'s set of Caladborg's "invoker", featuring a guest difficulty by [Backfire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/263110)! Although it's been over two years since its submission, invoker still stands out as an interesting mapset by today's standards.

The song provides plenty of musical and rhythmic variety throughout its various sections, and the improvisational nature of their mapping styles lend to difficulties which represent this song to its fullest potential. The lower difficulties also shine on their own, making this set one that players of all levels can enjoy.

### osu!catch

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-03-22-beatmap-spotlights-february-2018/kanpan.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/633255)

[Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) successfully polished up 09kami's initial inspiration for osu!catch mapping, with this marvellous set of the same song, Akiyama Uni's "Kanpan Tasogare Shinbun". The top difficulty begins with rather vertical and slow sliders, which gradually stretches as the song progresses.

These parts serve as a perfect foil to the climax, for which he engaged high-speed curving sliders ticked to the beat. The expressiveness of this delicate map justify its win in this month's Spotlights.

Another refreshing difficulty you won't want to miss is [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508)'s Overdose, intentionally avoiding hyperdashes throughout the map and thus creating interesting patterns. Don't be tricked by the low star rating. It definitely requires some hard work to clear it! Again, great work to every contributing mapper!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-03-22-beatmap-spotlights-february-2018/four-seasons.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/597325)

[-wwwww](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3922569)'s map of "Four Seasons" by t=NODE unsurprisingly takes players on a year long journey through the four seasons. From the calm of spring, to the warming sunshine of summer and to a somewhat dramatic autumn warning us of what's about to come next.

The white out blizzard of winter is ironically where the song and map come to life. Harsh and unforgiving, much like winter itself, -wwwww does not hold back. Winter is the season where this map earns its star rating.

There's no fire to warm yourself by and escape the cold on these challenging yet beautiful stream patterns so make sure you're well prepared.

Whilst it may be a simple touch, the storyboard is a really nice addition to the beatmap's theme. Falling leaves, glowing sunshine, a harsh blizzard and even a touch of rain accompany each season that adds to the atmosphere of the song.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-03-22-beatmap-spotlights-february-2018/canon.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/452107)

By bringing Mamoru Miyano's "Canon" to us, for which she had mapped an osu!standard TV size version 4 years ago, here [F D Flourite](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2459589) makes her first successful foral into osu!catch mapping, featuring [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) as a collaborator!

All you want to see about a modern-styled map can be found in this set, with appropriate difficulty spread for all fruit lovers. With great emphasis and creative flow, she impressively showcased her understanding of the song. Excellent job!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-03-22-beatmap-spotlights-february-2018/sennen.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/695431)

[Sinnoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4236057) continues to make a name for himself in catch with his latest mapset of Nekomata Master's "Sennen no Kotowari". Following on from his previous spotlight winning entry of Camellia's "Towards the Horizon" comes another instrumental, 2 minute long, ~153 BPM mapset mapped entirely by Sinnoh.

Despite some similarities, "Sennen no Kotowari" is a noticeably more subdued mapset in comparison. Gone are the energetic wubs and harsh hyperdashes and in their place are beautifully clean streams and pattern choices that really shine across all difficulties. With a wonderfully natural flow it should be second nature to any avid catch player.

### osu!mania

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-03-22-beatmap-spotlights-february-2018/yume.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/619531)

Topping off this month's mania Spotlights, [eyes](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7741797) returns to the ranked scene after two years with RADWIMPS's "Yume Tourou". With a fresh take on 8 key mapping, eyes restricts his columns to create a focus on one side of the map to reflect the pan of the music, and also utilizes slider velocity changes to emphasize key transitions and provide a varied experience for any player to enjoy.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-03-22-beatmap-spotlights-february-2018/yukari.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/416020)

After a two-year break between his last ranked map and now, [liaoxingyao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3620963) makes a come back with Ocelot's "YUKARI". Featuring prominent use of stacks and trills to create a contrast within the top difficulty, players must be alert to avoid missing at any of the many rigid transitions.

Its low level of difficulty makes it an accessible mapset for almost any level player, and is why it's found itself a spot in this month's spotlights.

We hope you enjoy our selection for this month and look forward to what we will bring to you in the future.

Until then, happy clicking, drumming, catching, and hitting the piano notes! Do not forget to have a rest occasionally!
