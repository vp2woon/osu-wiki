The votes are done and dusted, and now it's time for the snow to fall. Winter's well and truly here, and the main menu is ready to show it with the 15 winners from the Winter 2018 Fanart Contest! Check it all out!

2018 has been an interesting year, to put it lightly. You'd think things would be wrapping up for the year but no - there's still plenty left on the horizon before the year's officially set to close between Aspire 2018, the Fall Spotlights and even rumors of a few new Featured Artist announcements hanging in the wings.

But for now, we're all about that chill, and there's very little that's more chill than last year's wintery spin on the *circles!* theme by none other than the original osu!musician, [nekodex](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/1). *aureole* is really something special, and we're excited to bring it back again this year for any who may have missed it last year, or who are joining us for their first osu! winter.

*aureole* will be keeping the main menu nice and chill with the Winter seasonal backgrounds until the holidays are over. Downloads of the track are available on [nekodex's SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/nekodex/aureole) (or [over at his Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6vQtRObT6BGMhXrt0dmq92?si=Mqby-DWMSa6SQxUdVtHolA)), and if you're after a lossless download, you can name your own price over at [his Bandcamp](https://nekodex.bandcamp.com/track/aureole-osu-xmas-2017).

Without further ado, let's see which wonderful pieces of art will be joining this chill tune on the main menu this year:

Featuring pippi and Mocha all decked up in reindeer costumes and festive winter dresses, **[Chiruuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8911572)**'s entry warmed the hearts of **4695** voters, landing a solid first place result.

An absolutely beautiful piece, and well deserving of first place. Well done!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/banners/PisRyder.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/PisRyder.png)

Sporting a jacket-clad pippi enjoying a rest in a wintery park with teeny tiny takes on Aiko, Yuzu and Maria, **[PisRyder](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3457622)**'s entry nabbed **4085** votes, scoring second place overall.

Those eyes are absolutely enchanting. Seriously.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/banners/Shuuzo.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/Shuuzo.png)

**[Shuuzo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3661521)**'s take on Mocha, the Taikonator (in his winter form) Yuzu and pippi enjoying some time in the snow resulted in **3771** icy spheres pelted squarely at Yuzu's face.

He may be able to catch fruit, but he sure can't catch a break. Or snowballs, for that matter.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/banners/Misakko.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/Misakko.png)

**3701** snowflakes fell into Aiko's grasp in **[Misakko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3173752)**'s compelling piece depicting a rather majestic jaunt through a snow-tinged and aurora-lit sunset.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/banners/zeyez.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/zeyez.png)

**3653** votes lit up **[zeyez](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13237846)**'s beautifully decorated shot of Mocha enjoying some Christmas lights. Oooh, shiny.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/banners/Wa_coo.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/Wa_coo.jpg)

**3417** voters got stars in their eyes from **[Wa_coo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6538071)**'s almost criminally cute take on Mocha enjoying a walk over a snowy bridge. She's excited that you voted for her, duh.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/banners/Sylux6.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/Sylux6.png)

Enjoying a mountaintop walk with a distinctly Japanese-themed take on pippi, **[Sylux6](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2607507)** scored **3297** votes. Gorgeous stuff, and beautifully executed.

A new contender for medley-style pieces enters the fray, with **[D A R K N E S S](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4676233)**' work scoring **3202** votes. There's an *absurd* amount of effort in this piece with over half a dozen unique takes and costumes for a great ensemble of official and community mascots.

Check it out!

**3066** voters thoroughly approved of [\[ Pink Dreams \]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3204205)'s utterly adorable take on pippi enjoying some time in the snow. Did I mention that she's adorable?

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/banners/llNaokill.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/llNaokill.png)

**[llNaokill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7755095)**'s gloriously colourful take on a rugged-up pippi complete with translucent scarf won over the hearts of **2991** voters, and rightfully so!

A really refreshing take on the classic firelit tones of winter done in a super creative way.

**[elizabethgg](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7503187)**'s snapshot of pippi and Mocha looking out over a dimly lit bridge on a cold winter's night is like two hundred times more comfortable than it aught to be, and **2865** voters agreed.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/banners/ShovelKun.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/ShovelKun.png)

It's Maria time! **[ShovelKun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9948284)** showcased everybody's favorite osu!mania mascot in all of her adorable glory beside a simplistic but beautifully executed iconographic background, impressing **2858** voters.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/banners/ovelhenta.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/ovelhenta.png)

Oh deer! **[ovelhenta](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7284442)**'s piece of pippi snapping a candid shot with some of the local wildlife in a snowy forest is a beautifully colourful display of some classic winter tones with a stylistic touch. **2786** voters hit that like button!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/banners/SJPumpkin.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/73/winners/SJPumpkin.png)

All rugged up and rose-tinged from the cold, **[SJPumpkin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4840900)**'s beanie-clad pippi saw **2474** voters show their support in full.

Make sure to [check out the full results over at the contest listing page](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/73), there's a lot of really great entries!

It was a real surprise to see so many new faces in the running this year, and we were super happy to get the opportunity to see some new artists in the community flex their creative muscles.

As always, we were astounded by the sheer volume of entries, though we're a little worried that perhaps there's *too many* choices available for people to vote for! You can always trust the osu! community to continually outdo itself.

All the winning entries listed here will see their artists snag **2 months of osu!supporter** for their efforts, and all of them are also now available in-game as part of the Winter seasonal background pack.

From all of us here at the osu!team, we wish you all a happy holidays, and a wonderful New Year to come. Be good to one another!
