One year late, but better than never. Here's our documentary-style coverage of the osu! experience at [Anime Expo 2017](http://www.anime-expo.org). A lot of it is still relevant and unreleased footage which should make for an enjoyable watch for both those that could and couldn't make it to the event.

A huge thanks to pishifat for editing the footage (my goal of doing it myself delayed this process by a long time; sorry for that), to the volunteers and team members that came along and helped organise and run the event space. And of course, everyone who attended and made it an unforgettable experience!
