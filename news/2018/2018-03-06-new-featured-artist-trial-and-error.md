The search for new musical talent never ends, and we're proud to announce the next addition to osu!'s Featured Artist lineup - **Trial & Error**!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/20/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/20)

The mind behind countless Japanese and anime-themed tracks, **Trial & Error**'s work has been featured in popular projects like the cult classic visual novels *Stay! Stay! Democratic People's Republic of Korea* and *Panzermadels: Tank Dating Simulator*.

A multi-discipline master of music production, **Trial & Error**'s work crosses a variety of sounds and genres, ranging from the quintessential anime hits that have become massively prominent in osu!, to soulful ballads and grungy rock hits, supported with a variety of vocalists both real and virtual.

But don't take our word for it, have a listen to a small sample of what's available and see for yourself!

### Yoru wo Kakeru feat. ming-zi

> An airy vocal walk featuring the talent of ming-zi, Yoru wo Kakeru levels traditional instrumentation together with sweeping lyrics. Nothing particularly new, but an excellent take on a more standard musical approach.

### DAI★TAN SENSATION feat. Nanahira, Mii, Nakuru Aitsuki

> Uplifting and with all the sugar and sweetness expected from an anime-styled track, DAI★TAN SENSATION is a playful romp among the genre, with the added bonus of vocals from a few prominent singers among the Japanese music scene!

### Hoshizora Touhikou feat. Hatsune Miku

</audio>

> A heartfelt ballad rendered in the voice of the Vocaloid Hatsune Miku, Hoshizora Touhikou is a slow and paced walk throughout a sombre starscape, tied off with gentle, leading percussion towards the later parts of the track.

### Tokoyami no Keiyaku KEGARETA-SHOUJO feat. GUMI

<audio controls>
    <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/20/previews/377.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

> Beset with a backing choir, the voice of the Vocaloid GUMI reigns supreme in this fast-paced, rock-themed track.

### Houkai no Hate No Ishi feat. GUMI

> Slower paced and more pensive, Houkai no Hate No Ishi is a faintly ethereal take on a classic grungy rock sound, joined by the voice of the Vocaloid GUMI.
