Following in the footsteps of the other game modes, we are excited to announce that osu!catch will be marking its first appearance on the stage of the Mapping Olympiad. Naturally, some fantastic prizes are up for grabs, including the highly coveted *Elite Mapper* title. Anyone and everyone is encouraged to dive into the editor for some fruity fun; whether veteran or newcomer, could you be the one to rise above the rest?

If you've not followed the previous contests running through the year, the osu! Mapping Olympiad is a successor to the Monthly Beatmapping Contests of the past, featuring a wide array of competitions ranging from traditional beatmap spread contests to more specialized offerings such as speedmapping, thematic challenges and more!

In line with opening round Mapping Olympiad contests for the other game modes, the first offering for osu!catch will follow the more traditional and accessible style of spread beatmapping, so let's introduce you all to your new favourite song!

## Song Selection

To kick things off, we have selected a song that should strike a balance between accessibility and variety, accomodating a wide selection of styles and skill levels, courtesy of one of our many fabulous Featured Artists, [**Thaehan**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/7)!

Thaehan's *Yuujou* features a dizzying array of synthesizers layered with both drum and piano tracks, impressively packed into a bite-sized two-minute package. Offering huge variety at all difficulty levels and for mappers of all abilities, there's bound to be something on offer for all of our contestants!
