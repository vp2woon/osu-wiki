**Seven** agonizing choices await you from a grand selection of seventy-two entries in this year's blazing summer fanart contest. Head on over to the [contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/66) and get your votes in quickly, because there's only (you guessed it) **seven days** before the voting closes!

That's a lot of sevens.

A selection of the top-voted entries will make it to the main-menu as this year's summer seasonal background picks, which also includes a cameo during most of the osu!mania 4K World Cup!

Each winning artist will also receive **2 months of osu!supporter** to commemorate their well-earned victory. Nice.

Unsure of who to vote for? Check out this handy little animated preview, showcasing all the amazing entries in a slideshow set to the summertime spice of [IAHN's](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/3) track, *Summer Vacation*. Like what you hear? Map it!
