We'd like to welcome all of you to this year's official osu!mania 4K World Cup. We have split the 4K and 7K brackets of the MWC into two seperated tournaments and start with the 4K tournament. However, the rules have been adjusted from the previous MWC, so please [read them carefully](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2015#ruleset) before registering for this tournament.
