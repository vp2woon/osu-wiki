With some delay, the Ranking Charts for July 2015 have just been released and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1507)!
This month [monstrata](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2706438), [Stefan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/626907), [ExRei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1929336) and [Harbyter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1147679) picked the maps for the Monthly Ranking Charts.

## Ranking Charts Creation

The charts have previously been created by letting four dedicated community members select the most noteworthy maps of this month. We also reward the top beatmap in each category by providing **1 month of supporter status** to the mapper.

### osu!

For osu!, we decided to let **[monstrata](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2706438)** pick their favourite maps.

- **[Ceui - Hana ni Natta Shounen no Shinwa](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/296952) by [Narcissu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1826598)**

Despite its 10 minutes of drain time, this is one of the few maps that make you feel like you've only spent 3 minutes playing it. The map itself is very well designed. It showcases variety of visually appealing patterns that are not always structurally based. Furthermore, the map is very well hitsounded, with custom sets that really complement the various instruments in the song. Most importantly, however, this map demonstrates something that is often overlooked by new mappers: rhythm choice. Narcissu's choice of rhythms do not simply follow the music, but rather, they complement it, blending in both Ceui's voice with the various instruments in the background that are already supported through thoughtful hitsounding. The song is elevated to new heights as players are able to better appreciate the entirety of this musical masterpiece, and not simply the vocals or a single instrument. The result is a playing experience that leaves you wondering just how ten minutes flew by so quickly.

- [Erio o Kamattechan - os-Uchuujin(Asterisk Makina Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/325301) by [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087)

Open up this map in editor and you'll see some immaculate yet creative designs. Literally every circle and slider on this map is there for a reason and part of a pattern. If you want to look at some well structured maps, this is definitely one of them. Lets talk about some cool concepts shown here. The entire first section of this map features sliders going only in a single direction (up). This concept is really interesting because despite the repetitive upward motion, the section is really fun to play because of the various motions in between sliders. Slider shapes are also very well designed throughout this map. I really enjoyed the slider-art, but also the various 1/2 slider-shapes used. Also, I thoroughly enjoyed the streams on this map. They were challenging, but visually appealing, while still being tame enough to not affect playability. This was a challenging but expertly designed map, and I had a lot of fun playing it.

- [Razihel & Virtual Riot - One For All, All For One](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/275655) by [Fort](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2805457)

I will always have a special appreciation for mappers who can produce large mapsets for songs that are not tv-sized. Lets talk about the highest difficulty "Together We've Fallen". The sliders on this map are extremely well designed so that players can take advantage of slider-leniency to play otherwise complex and difficult patterns with relative ease. Additionally, while this map features a lot of 210 217.5 BPM single-taps they all play very intuitively and provide just enough of a challenge for the player without coming off as over-snapped. Don't forget to check out the other 10 difficulties in this set! There's bound to be a difficulty suitable for everyone.

- [onoken - Izayoi -INST-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/247580) by [cmn_891127](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/408461)

Wonderfully mapped. Great structural concept in this map! I also enjoyed the mapper's approach to the piano solo's towards the later half of the map. This map really showcases the beauty of the piano and lends appreciation to the genre of instrumental music. The most noticeable feature of the map of course, is it's extensive and meticulous hitsounding dedicated to the piano. Open up the map and you'll be greeted by sectioned barcodes of green lines with a multitude of piano hitsounds all set with different volumes to perfectly accompany the actual song. Try listening to these sections of the map with only hitsounds enabled and you will still be able to hear the music based solely off the hitsounding!

- [Demetori - Furuki Yuanxian ~ Death Echo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/291517) by [jonathanlfj](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/270377)

Another Demetori song mapped by none other than jonathanlfj! I thoroughly enjoyed the Extra Stage Collab between lfj, happy30, Kite, and Natteke. Through each of the sections, you can see different pattern arrangements and rhythm choices that reflect the style of each mapper. Yet, the map is impressively cohesive, with each style complementing each other matching the intensity of the song. Lunatic is also very well executed, with a clean mapping style and great flow. This is a great mapset, and it's really nice to see a full set for a Demetori song rather than just the song that are over 5 minutes.

- [HoneyWorks - Ima Suki ni Naru. ver.Capi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/286383) by [Nara](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2254666)

Nara did a great job with mapping this song. If you open up "First Love" in editor, it will not seem like much. Rather, it may even look a bit messy. However, these patterns and arrangements play remarkably well, especially the jump patterns. I don't know how, but they are just really easy to land. Additionally, the map flows very nicely and uses a wide variety of pattern arrangements to keep the player interested. I have to mention P A N's Insane as well because of how well it plays too. P A N's version is very structurally based, with a lot of geometry going on. Yet, it also flows very well, and all the jump patterns are really fun to play. Perhaps maps that flow well don't seem as difficult because many of the jumps and movements just feel more natural to the players.

### Taiko

For Taiko, we asked **[Stefan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/626907)** about their favourite maps in July 2015.

- **[Celldweller - I Can't Wait](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/170148) by [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766)**

I Can't Wait to go play the chart maps, and so you do. So let's go: The mapper showed us already some decent beatmaps but this one here is gold. The note usage feels very naturally and not necessary filled up with more notes than needed. Although it feels simpler than for its 5.26 stars it still has some challenging sections which can be hard to pass and trick you. Stream pattern, Finisher usage, SV in- and decrease are used wisely and makes the beatmap to a notable great piece of work. My personal number one for this month.

- [fripSide - black bullet](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/179224) by [-Sh1n1-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1957638)

I haven't seen a lot by the main mapper of the set but I see I should catch up for that. Spread is very well made, offers basic pattern in the Kantan and Futsuu Difficulty which gets decently harder in the Oni difficulties. Definitely a look worth to play.

- [Seiryu - Critical Crystal](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/138311) by [Sayaka-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/398275)

An older map which was quiet for a long time but came back - and also finally ranked! Although it feels weird to have "Beginner" as Difficulty the set has a great spread and being noticeable challenging at the Inner Oni. Oh, and do not underestimate the Oni Difficulty. Even that one got a high density! Especially in the Kiai sections.

- [Ayane - Go Love&Peace (short size)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/303149) by [Chaica](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4455389)

Some of you may hate low BPM beatmaps but they also can be pretty fun to play, and this mapper showed us that it's possible! Having a 4-difficulty mapset became uncommon at this time but feels well-made. The Futsuu may feels a bit harsh when you recently come from Kantan difficulties but it's still doable and good to learn some "harder" pattern, you know how "harder is here meant to be. I highly recommend to play this when you're newer in the Taiko mode since it offers very simple and common Taiko pattern to learn. You also should spread some Love & Peace, don't forget that.

- [Nanamori-chu * Goraku-bu - After School Days](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/292370) by [-TheHateD-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5018747)

I wasn't really sure about the spread because I had some doubt in the easier difficulties but I think I am just overreacting and they are actually fine enough. The Inner Oni got a lot of my attention and plays very very well. The rest of the set has a good spread line, introduced in the Kantan Difficulty some single 1/2 notes which increased in the Futsuu and afterwards in the Muzukashii difficulty. Oni plays good, nothing too hard or causing a too high gap with Muzukashii.

- [sasakure.UK feat. Kagamine Rin - Tiger Rampage](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/279175) by [tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767)

They were some controversial parts in the harder difficulties such as 1/6 usage but I honestly found them not that bad, as for someone which actually really dislikes the wrong usage of 1/6 pattern. The only two things which bugged me is the spread from Kantan to Muzukashii which could've been done better and the really really high SV in the Rampage Oni, last one is however a full personal preference. Beside of that: A good mapset which barely made it in my list (it caused me headache to make a final decision if I put it in the list or not).

### Catch the Beat

For Catch the Beat, **[ExRei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1929336)** was the chosen one to declare the winners of the July 2015 beatmaps.

- **[Hitsuji to Ojisan - XENO](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/193373) by [toybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2848604)**

Despite being a pp map, this map has a nice pattern. I mean the sliders that match the songs. Perfectly placed on right place and you can play that pattern while being relaxed. Definitely one of my most favorite CTB map on this month. You can also try another converted difficulty on this map and see that it is also well spreaded!

- [Arctic Monkeys - Balaclava](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/298913) by [Priti](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2198472)

Another map which is converted with its slider jumps in a good way. The map matches the song in a way, that will make you headbang while playing this map, I bet! So if you want a challenge, this map is just for you!

- [tomatomerde - Brave Shine](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/308945) by [milan-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1052994)

If you like TV Sized DnB music then this map is just for you. Nice sliderstream patterns and relaxing jumps which makes this map a good choice as warm-up before having extreme plays. The spread is nice. And it's a catchy song, too!

- [yes we cant - wh](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/295480) by [Nhawak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1572385)

One of the meme song on this month. Barney and his "companion" succeed in making this song catchy as hell. The map spread is really good despite the short length. From the easiest to hardest diff on converted difficulty and its CTB map. What a good jump map, even it's really absurd for some reason.

- [Erio o Kamattechan - os-Uchuujin(Asterisk Makina Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/325301) by [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087)

A marathon converted map. This map is really good(I bet you'll dancing after hearing this song too). The challenge is real, too, and the streams and jumps matches the song rhythm. If you like dnb + loli, this map is just for you. Try it!

- [MitiS - untitled guitar](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/309242) by [- Magic Bomb -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3071175)

The easiest map on this writing. Relaxing song with relaxing patterns. If you as beginner are new to CTB, try playing this beatmap. It is kinda made for CTB training and can be played on all mods!

### osu!mania

For osu!mania, **[Harbyter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1147679)** was able to select their personal most noteworthy beatmap from last month.

- **[xi - Garyou Tensei](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/210610) by [LNP-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4402842)**

"Beautiful challenging map" is the best to describe this beatmap by the difficulty spread, pattern and sound layering. It is true that 7K difficulty is hard due to lots of long note usage, mini jack along with long notes, double stream, and burst stream. But even though it is challenging, the pattern still fit the song perfectly. Not to mention that the 4K difficulty spread is well made as well. This really deserves the 1st place since the song is enjoyable and the map made in a way, where you are able to learn about long patterns.

- [MiddleIsland - Achromat](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/195940) by [iJinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737)

At first you might think this is just some random chord spam map with lots of stream and ridiculous jacks, just for the purpose to fill the difficulty gap in this set. But let me tell you, it's not! It is actually a pretty fun map which gives you an insight about how to use chord control, dealing with tons of jacking, playing long stream alongside with quick grace notes. Considering also that it is very well mapped in term of snapping and pattern placement that follows most of the time the piano.

- [Ogura Yui - Baby Sweet Berry Love (Tsukiko chan Maji kawa-E Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/316659) by [KawaEE](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4647754)

A map with a very good consistency and enjoyable patterns. What I love most about this beatmap is that it is not too hard and not too easy at the same time.  While it has some scary buildups, jacks and tricky long note sections, it is still easy because, its patterns are well placed and designed mostly hand balanced. The long note is well mapped while it doesn't make your fingers cramp. I'm sure this map can be enjoyed by most players.

- [penoreri - Everlasting Message](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/307175) by [Julie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2420987)

First of all, this is "a must have beatmap" for everyone. And even though it is not 1st on this ranking chart, doesn't mean it's below current 1st. This beatmap is awesome in in terms of learning how to chord in an easier way and stair control in "intuitive" way plus farming PP on "a very lovely song" that you will never get bored off. Sure, overall you can consider this map as easy, but it is really a very good 7K beatmap with nicely done patterns which aren't too stressful.

- [C-Show - Invitation from Mr.C](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/293235) by [\_FrEsH_ChICkEn\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3984370)

Probably the most exciting 4K of this month which really deserve a place here. Good spread; difficulty curve and patterns. It feels like it was meant to be fun by following the main rhythm only. It is also another beatmap for improving your chord control, alongside with short and long pattern. The jacks can be a quite serious challenge as well since this is 230 BPM song. This beatmap will absolutely entertain almost everyone. "J-J-Jack show!"

- [Junk - Yellow Smile(bms edit)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/302726) by [Starry-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2166199)

A great set doesn't always have to contain a really hard difficulty or hardcore stuff in general. But the main reason why I choose this set for the charts is the way being mapped in a very neat and clean way. Followed by a good and simple spread which absolutely fits for everyone's level. Even an average player can enjoy this beatmap by following the rhythm, which has a good difficulty curve, too.

**The July 2015 ranking charts will end on the 15th September 2015**. For the next month, we will elect new community members to pick their favourite beatmaps, so stay tuned!
