**[The osu!world cup is finally underway with registrations going live last Friday](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-10-01-osu-world-cup-2015-registrations-open)**. The registrations are open to all players within the top 5000 until the 18th of October. This world cup will be using a new scoring system similar to that of osu!stream's scoring system, which aims to make combo and accuracy important. The prize pool for this tournament starts at $5,000 with players being able to contribute to the prize pool. While we haven't gotten clear information how how we'll be able to contribute, there should be some information on this made available soon, so be sure to keep an eye out for this when it's announced. Don't forget to check out the **[discussion thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/371786)** to discuss all owc related things!

**[Banners to show that you support your OWC team are coming to osu!](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/130132623233/20150929)** While they haven't been released yet, **[peppy revealed a single banner](/wiki/shared/news/2015-10-05-osuweekly-30/Screen+Shot+2015-09-29+at+23.14.01.png)** on his blog this week. Soon you'll be able to show everyone which team is you're cheering for!

**[Lemmmy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4656511)** has created a **[new osu!next signature generator](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/372346)** to fit more with the upcoming design changes to osu!  While it only displays one game mode, there is some nice customization options such as colour and performance points display available. If you're the kind of player who frequents other forums and you like to include your osu! stats in your signature, this is worth taking a look at!

For any skinners or people looking to learn something new about the skinning, **[Deimos](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Deimos)** been making some **[huge changes on the skinning wiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Skinning)** with some help from **[123MegaApple123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/123MegaApple123)**. The skinning information has been completely revamped, covering all skin elements with helpful images for visual references.

There was no osu!next design drop this week as flyte has been preparing design assets for the upcoming OWC. However, as flyte promised a Q&A last week, **[he took some time this week to answer the questions that you've been asking!](https://next.ppy.sh/post/130325932173/qa-round-2)**

Lastly we had some new Beatmap Nominators added! Give a warm welcome to **[alienflybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/alienflybot)**, **[HappyRocket88](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/HappyRocket88)**, **[Ipas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Ipas)**, **[KawaEE](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/KawaEE)**, **[Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Raiden)** and **[tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/tasuke912)**.

That's all for this week everyone! As always you can send any news you'd like to be represented in the osu!weekly to **[news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh)** and we'll do our best to include that information. Anyway, Tasha will be back next week. I hope you all have a good week and good luck to all participating in any ongoing events.
