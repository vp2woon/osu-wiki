Hello everyone! Tasha here with the 17th edition of the osu!weekly for you all! I apologize for being a day late as I was extremely ill on Friday, but everything is ok now so lets get that news to you guys!

The **[osu!standard Global Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/333357)** hosted by **[- Nozomi -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/-%20Nozomi%20-)**, **[Lazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Lazer)** and **[- Kotori -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/-%20Kotori%20-)** has players ranking from 1k to 40k participating in a 3v3 double elimination tournament, and this weekend has the round of 32 matches taking place! Matches for this tournament are being streamed live at their **[official stream](http://www.twitch.tv/osuglobal)**, and is being commentated by **[SergeantJoe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/SergeantJoe)** and **[Gumi Rin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Gumi%20Rin)**.

User **[hvick225](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/hvick225)** has joined **[ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/ExGon)** in the 10000pp club, being the second user to make this outstanding achievement in their respective game mode, and the first ever to reach 10000pp in the standard game mode. This feat was achieved with a **[hidden doubletime score](https://osu.ppy.sh/ss/3323982)** on the recently qualified map **[u's - Music S.T.A.R.T!! [wkyik's Expert]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/660357&m=0)**. This score was enough to give them 467pp and just barely push them over the 10000pp mark.

Surprisingly enough, **[hvick225](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/hvick225)** wasn't the only user to join the 10000pp club this week! The third player to reach 10000pp and the first to do so in osu!mania was none other than **[F1rstLove](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/F1rstLove)**! This user achieved this with a **[very impressive full combo](/wiki/shared/news/2015-07-04-osuweekly-17/ss+(2015-07-04+at+10.01.22).jpg)** on the song **[MiddleIsland - Achromat [7K Black Another]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/553820?m=3)**, giving them 572pp, which was more than enough to break the 10000pp barrier.

This week on **[peppy's blog](https://blog.ppy.sh/)**, we had quite a few different topics covered. **[June 27th there was a large Q&A posted](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/122576677808/20150627-answers-3)** that went into general coding questions and open source questions relating to osu!. On **[June 30th](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/122774134628/20150629)**, peppy posted **[another video](https://youtu.be/MiMhtlHI6ZQ)** showcasing the different graphics bugs, as well as explaining why he hasn't done a code stream yet. On **[July 1st](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/122879031608/20150630)**, peppy reached the point that **[he decided the 2d math for the graphics architecture needed rewriting](https://youtu.be/RsLMYcEhs-I)**, though **[on the 2nd of July, things were back to how they should be rendering](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/122967267078/20150701)**. **[A day later](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/123040150623/20150702-nesting)**, peppy took a moment to explain why the changes to the graphics framework of osu! were taking place, **[using a video of the osu!stream UI](https://youtu.be/pA-uqX8YSXQ)** as an example. **[He quickly followed this with another post](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/123111078853/20150703)** showing a **[rather humorous video](https://youtu.be/8gnhZ9JO0IE)** of what can be achieved with the new system being implemented.

This week, Flyte posted up a **[quick 4 second video](https://youtu.be/n7mlLC9DfTU)** on the osu!next blog showcasing new hit circle animations! Can't wait to see what some people end up doing with their skins with all these awesome new things being implemented.

**[Loctav and smoogipooo have created a helpful wiki page about the tournament client](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Osu!tourney)**. This page covers everything you'd need to know about while using the client. There is quite a bit to read, but if you're looking to get a tournament running smoothly you should definitely read over it all. Don't forget you can also download a template background **[here](https://osu.ppy.sh/images/tournament/template.zip)** which contains a .png, .psd and the exo 2.0 font!

**[T-Aiko 2.0 is now available on the google play store!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=guy.taiko)** This is an update to the older T-Aiko application for android, and allows you to play taiko songs from osu on your android phone. If you're big on Taiko, this is definitely worth checking out, especially if you're on the go a lot.

Last week, there was a new community voice poll opened by our muscle armed seagull overlord **[Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335)** asking the community **[what their favourite map duration is](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/340082)**. There are options from below 30 seconds up to 30 minutes or more, and you can choose multiple durations as your favourites. To help us know what are the most popular song durations, be sure to check this out and vote!

**[This week there were two new members added to the team](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/4298107)**. Please welcome **[[ Another ]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/%5B%20Another%20%5D)** to the chat moderators for #hungarian and **[Kurokami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Kurokami)** to the QAT!

That's all the news for this week everyone. As always you can send any news you'd like to be represented in the osu!weekly to **[news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh)** and I will do my best to include that information. Have a good weekend everyone and take care!
