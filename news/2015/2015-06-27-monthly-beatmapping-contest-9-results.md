With our first ever taiko only mapping contest coming to a close, the results are in and the winner has been decided. This one was a taiko mapset only, so no standard, ctb or mania difficulties this time around!

The winner of the contest was **[Firce777](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Firce777)** with a score of 106 points. This is a scary close 3 point lead over **[Naryuga](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Naryuga)**, who scored 103 points from the judges to get second place, **[Hanjamon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Hanjamon)** also tied for second. Not far behind with only a 12 point difference was **[MMzz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/MMzz)** with a respectable 91 points.

This map is going to be bundled into the installer for the game along with 6 months of supporter and a mapper title for the winning entry. For those who would like to play it right now, **[you can find it here](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/319473)**. Make sure you give it a go, as the map definitely earned its first place score.

If you want to know the judges comments and the results of the other mappers, you can take a look at them on the **[results page](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/contestresults?c=18)**.

Congratulations to the winning mapper, and we hope that eveyone will enjoy the now running CtB themed Monthly Beatmapping Contest #10!
