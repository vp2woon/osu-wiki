Throughout the last 4 months, with over 100 competitors, we went through 4 stages and managed to narrow it down to 3 singers to be our winners.

This year it was up to you, the community, to decide who will shine as the osu!idol! Over the course of 2 weeks, we gathered your votes and now that the time is up, the results shall be announced!

Congratulations to our finalists, their efforts put into the final entries can not be unnoticed. In some cases, people thought these were the actual original and were shocked when told it was a cover!
This is only the beginning of their musical career, their talent is fit for any stage out there, should they choose to follow it further! Best wishes to all of them!

1st place will recieve a profile badge "osu!idol 2015 winner" and a 6 month supporter tag, 2nd and 3rd place will receive 4 months of supporter and 2 month respectively.
But we are sure these are nothing in comparison to an entire community applauding at their performance!

Now then, it is time to wrap this up! We would like to thank the entire community for taking part in this voting, participating in the competition and supporting it until the very end! Let's not forget about the judges. Their share of work was definitely up there, with the task of narrowing down the finalists from more than 100 singers!
All of this would not have been possible without them!

That is all from this year's osu!idol! Do you love singing? Want to have a competition, feel like having fun or even both? Keep an eye out as we will be back again next year around the end of August!
