The osu!world cup Round of 16 stage has come to a close. In this stage, each of the remaining teams were split into two separate groups to battle off for a spot in the quarter finals. [You can view the results of this round and obtain more information about the cup via the osu!wiki page](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Osu!_World_Cup_2015). Don't forget to tune into [the osu!live twitch channel to watch the quarter finals, which will begin broadcasting on Saturday the 21st 8pm UTC.](http://www.twitch.tv/osulive)

A new addition has come to the osu!store. [Players can now show support for a specific country in the osu!world cup by purchasing profile banners](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/38), all revenue made on the banners will go towards funding the prizes for the cup.

[WubWoofWolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/39828) achieved an amazing feat with his astonishing HardRock play on [DragonForce - Defenders](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/323059), giving him a whopping 667 pp. Make sure to check it out.

[peppy revealed in his blog of upcoming changes to the new osu!web targeting the forum design](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/133138664398/20151114) [new.ppy.sh](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums). Keep an eye out for them.  Also in his blog, performance gains are slowly increasing. [The new stable release has reduced stutter frames along with many other fixes.](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/changelog?v=b20151113.3)

osu!talk recently had an interview with [Starrodkirby86](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Starrodkirby86), an old returning player in osu! and a fan of Susumu Hirasawa. [The interview can be found in the youtube osu!academy channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54VUzflrXws) for those that missed it.

Expect some good changes to the new osu!web though, as [flyte has shown us some sneak peaks of designs that will be used in the new forums](https://next.ppy.sh/post/133123495328/i-cant-think-of-a-brilliant-caption-for-week). Overall, you're looking at changes in looks as well as functionality in the new forums, so definitely take a look at that.

Someone new has joined the staff this week. Please give a warm welcome to [Yason](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Yason), the newest member to join the Global Moderation Team (GMT). [Maeglwn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Maeglwn), formally a member of the GMT, has been moved to the osu! alumni, we wish him a friendly goodbye for now.

That's all for this week folks. If you want something included in future issues, send an email to **[news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh)** and we'll take a look. Have a good week!
