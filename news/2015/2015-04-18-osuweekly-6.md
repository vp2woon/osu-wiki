If you missed any of the previous week's matches and are interested, you can see the _[match history of every match that happened in the TWC](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2015#match-results)_ on the wiki page. Feel free to discuss the results and congratulate your teams for making it as far as they did in the _[discussion on the forums!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/279723)_

_[The 9th Monthly Beatmapping Contest is now underway, this MBC being a taiko only mapping contest.](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-04-13-monthly-beatmapping-contest-9-taiko-only)_ Mappers are challenged to make four taiko difficulties to the song Storm World, done by popular artist Furries in a Blender, also known as Renard. The deadline for this contest is the 28th of April, so If you're planning to participate you best get started on making your mapset soon!

_[The 2015 Hungarian osu! Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/304844)_ being hosted by _[Arthemesia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2033514)_ and _[Cremation](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1059525)_ is going into the semi-final stage this week. This tournament has different brackets for different player skill levels, there being a bracket for _[hard](http://challonge.com/2015hard)_, _[insane](http://challonge.com/2015insane)_ and _[extra](http://challonge.com/2015extra)_ difficulty level maps. Some matches from the semi-final and finals are going to be streamed on _[Arthemesia's twitch channel.](https://www.twitch.tv/arthemesiia)_

_[Mercurius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Mercurius)_ and _[Momovely](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Momovely)_ have compiled a list of the _[top 15 Japanese players for 2014](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/158nP_NorYOBaDGYtjyEUjCGSlsJeRr3x3P84K0wqoc0/edit#gid=0)_ with the assistance of the community.

_[osu!talk interview with Luna, the captain for the German TWC team, is now live!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5akyzJuLLFI)_ While there were some questions asking game modes such as standard / CTB / mania, the discussion largely involved taiko related questions as the interview was done while the TWC was going on. Some questions were asked about their taiko playstyle, why they focused on Hard Rock so much, and how they felt participating in the TWC. If you're interested in learning a bit more about one of Germany's best taiko players, then definitely give this a watch!

Do you make skins for osu? Have you ever wanted to try, but found managing the project to be a hassle? Well the _[osu! Skin Manager](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/231747&start=0)_ made by _[bl8ckdr8gon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3685723)_ is just for you! This program aims to make the process of creating, editing and exporting your skin far easier. It has many more features as well, such as audio support and a simulator to see what your skin looks like without using the game! If you're a skinner, this project is definitely for you, so give it a look and start making some skins!

That's all for this week folks! See you all next week, hopefully with some new exciting things going on!
