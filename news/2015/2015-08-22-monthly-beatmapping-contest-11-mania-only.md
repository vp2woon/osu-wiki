We just opened the submissions for the 11th Monthly Beatmapping Contest! This will be the first mania only mapping contest and with the awesome song "Freedom Planet - Dragon Valley (Toni Leys Remix feat. Esteban Bellucci)".

For the previous contest we had a quirky, fun 8-bit remix from the Legend of Zelda. This time we're moving to an energetic remix from the game Freedom Planet. There's lots going on here with plenty of instruments to map to, leaving plenty of opportunity to show off your mapping prowess. You can listen to the contest song **[here](https://puu.sh/jA1On/241f3ca38f.mp3)**

## What are the prizes?

- 6 months of supporter for you or a friend!
- 'Elite Mapper' forum title
- **Winning mapset will be bundled with the osu! game client download!**

## What are the rules?

- You must map 4 difficulties in an appropriate spread - either ENHI (easy, normal, hard and insane) or NHIX (normal, hard, insane, expert).
- Collaboration is allowed, but will only be registered under the name of the person who submitted the beatmap. Prizes for a winning mapset will only be given to the uploader.
- Difficulty names must only be the name of the respective difficulty, and nothing else. No ztrot's Hard or anything comparable.
- Maps submitted to the contest must not be submitted to the BSS until the contest has concluded.
