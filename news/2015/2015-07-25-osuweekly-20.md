Hello everyone! Tasha here with the 20th digest of the osu!weekly. Would like to apologize for this week being later than usual as I haven't been in good health. It's been a bit of a quiet week regardless, so let's get right into it.

**[This is the last week to register for the 2015 4K Mania World Cup!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-07-12-osumania-4k-world-cup-2015-registrations-open)** Registrations will be open until the 2nd of August. Keep in mind that registrations are individual now and not team based, so if you're interested in playing, are within the top 5000 and haven't broken the **[osu! community rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Rules)** in the past year, be sure to head over to the **[registration page](https://osu.ppy.sh/tournaments/1)** and sign up! If you'd like to discuss this tournament, be sure to head over to the **[discussion topic](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/345431)** on the forums, where plenty of new information will be posted as it becomes available. You can also check out the **[wiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/MWC_4K_2015)** for any additional information you might need.

**[The Quarterfinals for osu!: Last Man Standing have come underway this weekend with teams from several countries competing.](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/338022)** osu!LMS is a 3v3 tournament hosted by **[Backfire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Backfire)** with a knockout double elimination structure where teams advance by eliminating the three opposing players from the match. You can see a schedule of the upcoming matches **[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QcC0GPRePLzz1_GHpfKAQ-vK11DM7_qwKgyTD8M7DUg/edit#gid=50987894)** that will be streamed on the **[LMS stream](http://www.twitch.tv/taikoworldcuplms)** for everyone to watch.

**[The Catch the Beat Korean Tournament #1 (or CKT #1 for short) also has its quarterfinal matches going on this weekend.](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/340635)** This tournament hosted by **[CLSW](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/531253)** is a 2v2 single elimination CTB tournament featuring players of Korean nationality competing against each other. If you didn't get enough CTB following the Catch the Beat World Cup from before, be sure to check this out by tuning in to their **[stream](http://www.twitch.tv/crystalseed)** and cheer on your favourite players.

This week has caused quite a bit of an upstir in the **[mania rankings](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/pp/?m=3)** with the qualified map **[D(ABE3) - MANIERA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/272871)** being quite a gold mine for highly skilled mania players looking to improve their rank. **[Many players ended up bringing their performance points over 10,000](https://puu.sh/jcFzh/32308e11ec.png)** before the map was **[disqualified following incorrect artist information](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/4362754)**, though **[this didn't stop players going right back at it once it was requalified](https://puu.sh/jcBPB/1f81cda581.png)**, there now being more 10,000pp players than there was before the disqualification. With this major shift in the rankings we now have 24 different players in the exclusive 10,000pp club, one in osu!standard, one in Catch the Beat, and 22 whopping players in osu!mania.

An impressive play from the player **[Xilver](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/xilver)** was made last week on the song **[Yooh - Ice Angel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/668662)** with a 99.78% HR FC, netting an impressive 614 performance points and jumping them to rank 21 in osu!standard.

Several general questions were asked to **[peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/peppy)** this week, which he took the time to answer on his **[blog's weekly Q&A](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/124649324483/20150721)**. Those looking for new information may be a little disappointed however, as this week there was no new info posted in regards to osu!next or the features that it will have.

As it turns out, things weren't just slow on peppy's blog, as we also aren't seeing much from osu!next this week. **[Flyte sat down and took the time to show what kind of projects he works on during his down time](https://next.ppy.sh/post/124911961721/its-been-a-slow-week-spent-the-entire-week)**, explaining how knowledge obtained from working on these other projects can help with bigger projects like osu!

That's all the news for this week everyone. As always you can send any news you'd like to be represented in the osu!weekly to **[news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh)** and I will do my best to include that information. Sorry that it wasn't as much as usual. Hopefully things will pick up next week! Until then have a good weekend everyone!

â€”Tasha
