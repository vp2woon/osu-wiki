The Ranking Charts for December 2014 have just been released and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1412)! We also updated the [Ranking Charts long-term leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rgaKVJj_MDo0PwGrGXbKRVzjE9fhOUb4XZXRsOjTaoQ/edit).

The current season winner will be rewarded with an additional **3 months supporter tag** and the user title **Charts Champion** for 3 months. Furthermore, if one of the current title holders wins the new season as well, they will be rewarded with an additional **6 months supporter tag** and the user title **Charts Grandmaster** for 3 months. The winner of each individual ranking chart will receive a 1 month supporter tag.

The charts have been created by letting the [CAT](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/21) and the Staff Members vote for the most noteworthy maps of each respective month. They will end on the 15th February 2014.

We also picked up the osu!mania charts again and are releasing the voted beatmaps for September and December together, so we can catch up the lost time appropriately. Keep in mind that the osu!mania Ranking Charts season will also conclude with the January charts, so you only play in two months for this season!

Congratulations to the winners of the November 2014 Ranking Charts. They get rewarded with a 1 month supporter tag:

- **osu! standard:** [Kaoru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/492699)
- **Taiko:** [Konpaku Sariel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533502)
