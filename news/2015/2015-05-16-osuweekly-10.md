Hey guys and girls, Tasha here with another week of osu!weekly! Things are a little slow this week after such an eventful last week, though there's still some pretty cool things going on and coming up in the world of osu!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/weekly_1.jpg)

**[The Catch the Beat World Cup is going into the Round of 16 this weekend!](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2015)** The first match of the weekend will be on Saturday at 10am UTC, running straight through until 5pm UTC. If you'd like to see the schedule for the matches, you can see them in the **[match schedule](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2015#tournament-schedule)** section of the wiki page. Be sure to **[tune in](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive)** to watch your teams compete to stay in the winners bracket!

**[Signups for the NAT osu!standard tournament have closed, and the brackets have been made public](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/4158484)** by the tournament's organizer, **[MMzz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/MMzz)**. The NAT will be starting on June 6'th, so be prepared to cheer for your favourite North American players!

Among several other changes, **[osu! is slowly being pushed towards cross compatibility as migration to openGL continues](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/changelog?v=next)** Be sure to take a look at this with the Beta release stream in the client and to **[report any issues that you run into while running the update!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/328606)**

osu!next this week didn't have anything to show us other than **[some screenshots of what is being worked on, just without showing the actual work.](http://osunext.tumblr.com/post/119008792078/work-has-been-pretty-insane-this-week-not-allowed)** Good luck guessing what it is that Flyte was working on in those screenshots!

**[Good news for tournament runners! The new osu!Tourney template has been made publically available](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/327120)**, allowing tournament managers who are streaming their tournaments to have an easier time setting up their streaming layout and customizing it as they see fit.

That's all for this week! Remember to send anything you'd like to see included in osu!weekly or osu!news to [news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh) for us to see! Hope to see you all during the CWC matches this Saturday.... until next week!

â€”Tasha
