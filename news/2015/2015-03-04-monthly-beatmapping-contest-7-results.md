The wait is finally over! The winners of our first multi-mode Monthly Beatmapping Contest have been decided, and what a contest it was. Four different modes, four unique winners, and one amazing beatmap at the end of it all, bundled exclusively with the game client forever more! See the results here.

Several months ago, we held our first multi-mode version of the Monthly Beatmapping Contest for all to participate in. Several issues stemming from the sheer size of the contest along the way postponed the judging process somewhat, but we've finally managed to incorporate the work of _four unique winners_ into a glorious multi-mode mapset for everyone to enjoy. This beatmap is also bundled with the game client forever more, and celebrates the first concerted effort to produce a multi-mode mapset that can actually be distributed with the game. Congratulations to everyone involved!

The winner of the osu!standard portion of the contest was [Gamu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/611174) with a score of _121_ points, closely followed by [TestApple](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2248413) with a score of 119 and [K i A i](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/747356) with a score of 118.

The Taiko portion of the contest was won cleanly by [MMzz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/128993) with a score of _129_ points, followed by [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766) with 119 points and [qoot8123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/766371) with 116 points.

Unfortunately, only two competitors stepped forward for the CtB portion of the contest, with [Deif](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/318565) nearly taking the win by default with _84_ points, closely followed by [CLSW](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/531253) with 79 points.

The osu!mania portion of the contest was won solidly by [ExPew](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/665612), blowing away the rest of the competition with a _118_ point lead, followed by [shionelove](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/501551) with 96 points and [Tear](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1340650) with 86 points.
