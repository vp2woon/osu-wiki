Hello everyone and sorry for the late announcement! The Ranking Charts for October 2015 have just been released and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=1510)!

This month [Priti](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2198472), [SKSalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3280542), [- Magic Bomb -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3071175) and [ExUsagi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3027421) picked the maps for the Monthly Ranking Charts.

## Ranking Charts Creation

The charts have previously been created by letting four dedicated community members select the most noteworthy maps of this month. We also reward the top beatmap in each category by providing **1 month of supporter status** to the mapper.

### osu!

For osu!, we decided to let **[Priti](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2198472)** pick their favourite maps.

- **[zts - resurrectedreplayer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/304672) by [EvilElvis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1848318)**

It's no surprise that Elvis is one of the leading mappers of the current era, and this map represents that perfectly! From clever patterns, genius flow and lovely hitsounding, this map serves it all in terms of quality. The map itself features some things that aren't seen commonly nowadays such as 1/6 bursts, big vertical jumps and complex rhythms by using the song's melody to its fullest. Overall, this map is a blast to play, I haven't had this much fun in playing a map for quite a while, and even though it's not so difficult, it reflects the song to its fullest potential in a way that is extremely enjoyable.

- [cYsmix - House With Legs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/361785) by [D33d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/791387)

There isn't much to say about D33d's mapping, its clean, its consistent and his maps are really fun to play! They show quite a challenge in rhythm, but that's exactly what makes them so nice to play and so fun. Combining lovely rhythms with appealing patterns is a winning recipe for any song, and this is no different. This map earned its way into this list, and if it wasn't for Elvis, it'd probably win too.

- [MYTHOLOGIA by MLREC. - Ymir](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/322481) by [Kitami Erika](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1509338)

There seems to be a pattern here with my choices, sort of low BPM, complex rhythms, clean composition, but hey, that isn't bad in any way! This map is by a mapper who I personally never heard of, but I sure hope I'll hear of them at least once again. This map reflects the song in a unique way with the usage of slider spacing and 1/4 jumps, while keeping everything really simple and fun to play.

- [Camellia - flying in the flow of deep-sea](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/347898) by [-kevincela-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/266596)

I know what you guys are thinking, "Ugh, this song again?!", and yet, here it is! This version of the song stands out for me the most due to how well it reflects not only the rhythm, but the whole feeling of the song, from the sharp slider design to the flow of the patterns and the shapes of the streams, this all reflects the song in an amazing way while still keeping a visually appealing and clean map, which is quite a challenge for dubstep songs of this nature. Overall, the map doesn't show anything new or "special", but it's composed in a way that is so fun and neat that I had to mention it in this list.

- [Bring Me The Horizon - Can You Feel My Heart](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/221860) by [Vass_Bass](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/188248)

Yet again, a map that isn't so difficult, but it has a special place in my heart. The overall composition style is pretty unique to Vass, making every map she releases yet another success, and this is no different! It has great hitsounding, lovely rhythms, amazing flow and of course, a really good song. The thing that makes this so special is the use of whistles. It is usually seen in maps made by people such as Vass, Reiji-RJ and EvilElvis, but here it's put in a unique way that emphasizes what Vass wanted to emphasize while still going well with the song, giving it a whole new layer.

- [Avizura - Lucky Star](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/130546) by [Bearizm](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3495259)

I usually dislike DnB maps due to them being generally boring and unoriginal, but this one kinda broke the myth for me. True, this isn't the new 8bit princess, But it is pretty interesting. The composition has unique spacing and flow that usually isn't seen in such songs. While keeping the main concepts of DnB maps, being solid movement throughout the map, not overly complex patterns and pleasant hitsounding that doesn't override the music, this map is a whole lot of fun! This map made its place into this list by honor considering that it's something that I usually dislike.

### Taiko

For Taiko, we asked **[SKSalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3280542)** about their favourite maps in October 2015.

- **[xi - ANiMA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/326029) by [tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767)**

Beautiful music and beautiful mapset. This beautiful work is done by beautiful tasuke912. Every difficulty, from Kantan to Inner Oni, is very good, especially Inner Oni, which is following the music accurately and gives due to this the map a great playability. Advanced players can enjoy it even more by using mods. In addition to this, easier difficulties are also very nice, so I think all players can enjoy this mapset. Let's play this beatmap which has such great quality!

- [Ci Mei Gui - Wu Xuan Lan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/339558) by [Nardoxyribonucleic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/876419)

I chose this as the second best set because, it gives a good example of how a neat difficulty spread can be made. Additionally, every difficulty is mapped in an enjoyable way. Let's download it and start playing now!

- [Unknown Artist - Miniministop Hitoyasumi no Uta[Mokuyoubi]Gakusei no Uta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/228647) by [Mame ga nyaa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1870588)

This friendly set is the easiest and shortest one in this chart. Every difficulty is mapped in a good way, following the calm song in an appropriate way. It is really short, so you can play it as many times as you want. One player has even become crazy by retrying to fullcombo it...! Of course, you can also enjoy this set by using mods. Have fun!

- [Black Raison d'etre - INSIDE IDENTITY](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/66901) by [taiko_maniac1811](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/595764) & [lolcubes](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/578401)

This song is long compared to the others. It's over 4 minutes, but you'll never get tired of playing it. There are two difficulties with a basic flow, but it gives you a feeling of how the gameplay in Taiko works. It represents the sentence "less is more" in a good way.

- [Doma Umaru [CV.Tanaka Aimi] - Kakushinteki*Metamaruphose!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/332623) by [_Gezo_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/481582) & [Nardoxyribonucleic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/876419)

This song is a famous japanese anime song and its mapset contains all modes. You are able to enjoy the melody even if you don't know the song yet, so I think, overall the maps are very well made. It is a good chance to start playing Taiko, so let's enjoy it!

- [Renard - Bumblefuck](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/243045) by [Lost The Lights](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1255920)

I chose this mapset as the last one, mapped by Lost The Lights. The high BPM is common for Renard and because of this, it makes the mapset hard. I love the usage of finishers in the Collab Inner Oni difficulty. The last 1/6 pattern is like hell and makes me crazy! Let's try to get a S rank!

### Catch the Beat

For Catch the Beat, **[- Magic Bomb -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3071175)** was the chosen one to declare the winners of the October 2015 beatmaps.

- **[8284 vs wa. - Adularescence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/245851) by [alienflybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114)**

I think it'll come as no surprise to anyone to see this here. An amazing set of 4 difficulties, a salad and rain by alienflybot, the owner of the set, who never fails to impress with his amazing flow, especially in rain difficulties. His salad is also a good challenge for newer players, and can be fun to play with mods for more experienced players. The platter for this set is by Zirox, and is fun for newer players through the use of nice flowing simple streams, and repeat sliders, which also make a fun challenge to high tier players as they try to DoubleTime it. The Overdose is by a popular standard mapper, toybot, and the use of hypers and flow in this difficulty is just beautiful. I can see a lot of potential in toybot as a CtB mapper, with this difficulty being one of my favourite overdoses I've ever seen, comparable to the best.

- [Doma Umaru [CV.Tanaka Aimi] - Kakushinteki*Metamaruphose!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/332623) by [Crystal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1646397)

This is a very popular beatmap, as it features all 4 modes, as well as a Standard difficulty by the well renowned Skystar, Skystar's Laziness. However, the part which will catch the eyes of most CtB players would be the "Umarudose" difficulty, by CLSW. This difficulty uses the fast and upbeat nature of the song to make for a very difficult but fun beatmap, using nice flow, a high AR, and some very difficult patterns. For players who have difficulty playing maps that hard, there are always the converted standard difficulties, which range from an easy to the aforementioned Skystar's Laziness, which converts into a very hard beatmap, even for top 20 players.

- [ESTi - HELIX (Edit ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/194910) by [Hollow Wings](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/416662)

A map ranked very late into the last month, Helix provides a fun challenge for players, with an overdose from the amazing Spectator, who never fails to surprise me and other players with his inventive mapping style and fantastic flow. The use of hypers in this map make it fit greatly to the intense nature of the song, and make this a very memorable map for any high level CtB player. As an added challenge, there are also numerous EX's from standard maps which convert in very different ways, with 5 Expert difficulties in total for you to try out, ending with the EX EX by Hollow Wings herself, whose maps are always interesting to play. If you're not a high enough skill level to play these difficulties, you can always play the lower ones, which convert into nice maps for newer players to practice their skills.

- [Kalafina - believe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/316647) by [CLSW](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/531253)

This map is different from what most players are used to from CLSW, as to most higher level players, the name CLSW normally hints at a very difficult map coming, however with this, it's an easier map, but still feels really nice to play, and helps show that he is able to map all levels of playing. The streams play nicely, flow is good, and the spinners at the end can make for some massive difference between the good spinners and the bad spinners. The song is long, but worth playing, as a fun map following a nice song. The salad and platter difficulties are good for new players, and the Bless difficulty is especially good practice for players that are new to rain difficulties, to help them in starting out.

- [My Chemical Romance - Helena](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/320194) by [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418)

A well known song, that I can assume had a place in a lot of osu player's childhood, like it did for mine, as a massive fan of MCR back when I was younger. Combined with the fact that pishifat is one of my favourite mappers for standard, as the way his maps convert to CtB is always interesting and fun to play for me, I couldn't help but involve this in here. With a nice range of 8 difficulties, there is a difficulty for everyone, each of them converting into a fun map for CtB, with guest difficulties from Gero and Kyshiro to help make the mapset even more fun for all skill ranges of players. The streams play nicely, and the atmosphere of the song helps amplify the map even more, making for an amazing mapset overall. Definitely one of my favourite converts, if not my favourite.

- [S3RL feat Sara - Techno Kitty](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/345450) by [Bakari](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/597957)

Another convert map of another amazing song, this map by Bakari is a very fun convert. The way jumps are used plays very well in CtB, with a layer of fun difficulty there. Techno music has a way of always being interesting to play after being converted due to the fast and upbeat nature combined with the seemingly random nature of converted maps, which leads to some very fun movements, and difficult jumps. Bakari mapped all 5 difficulties for this set, each of them being good for the player they're aimed at, even after being converted.

### osu!mania

For osu!mania, **[ExUsagi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3027421)** was able to select their personal most noteworthy beatmap from last month.

- **[Halozy - Kanshou no Matenrou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/350528) by [Rumia-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1787171)**

In 2015, sometimes I felt there weren't many 7k maps that were special in their own, unique way that were ranked. I am so glad that Rumia- gave me another chance to play some cool stuff that has been absent for a while in the ranked listing: A true, challenging and impressive 7K osu!mania map.

What impressed me, despite the fact that the song is rather repetitive, is that the structure of the patterns in each phase are designed in a creative and different way. It doesn't feel like there are any repetitive and boring patterns; it is flow at its finest, and the map itself is very solid and fits perfectly with the mood of the song.

Some key features of the map that I'd like to point out is that the map and the song flow perfecting in sync with each other. As the music transitions from a more intense sound to a more quiet, relaxed phase, and then becomes more climatic until the end, the map merges together perfectly through each of these sections.

Just to point out, not every mapper is able to map something as brilliant as has Rumia- did for their mania mapset. Honestly, for me, this map deserved the first spot for this monthly chart!

- [xi - ANiMA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/324288) by [Kuo Kyoka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596306)

Everytime you see a song by xi in the ranked beatmaps with over 190BPM, you better prepare your fingers to play a streamy piano map. Kuo Kyoka and the guest difficulty mappers managed to create another impressive, solid, and sweet mapset for 4K and 7K modes for everyone! With a note chart that focuses on the piano and patterns that vary for each difficulty, it's amazing to see such a wide ranged mapset with so many guest difficulties that are designed with appropriate difficulty spread. This is really hard to achieve, as it is sometimes really hard for every mapper to keep the difficulty spread well with so many guest difficulties. Good job, Kuo Kyoka and guest difficulty mapper!

- [xi - over the top](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/351320) by [Zan -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1411817)

The second xi song I picked for this month. Just like ANiMA, you better prepare your fingers to play a 202 BPM streamy map that would be considered really difficult, due to the 1/8 long stream. Get stuck in Extra? Play the easier difficulty first.
The note chart layering is focused on the rhythm of the piano sounds and the upbeat percussion. Zan - did a great job to represent the climax of the song through his 4K mapset, each difficulty guides you through to travel the rhythm so high, over the top!

- [sakuzyo - Imprinting](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/318277) by [KawaEE](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4647754)

Simple and super solid N H I set, sakuzyo brings you another catchy song, while KawaEE brings you a great 7K mapset along with it. The difficulty gap is designed great for such small set, and as always, KawaEE did a great job on hitsounding the note chart, and placing the notes and long notes in a catchy way to represent the music. Try this 7K, and as KawaEE said, get your implant!

- [44teru-k remixed wa. - Isetsu Higanbana Daini -Shuusei no Lycoris-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/235278) by [liaoxingyao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3620963)

The secondnd set with simple and solid N H I in 4K. liaoxingyao and SanadaYukimura made a well-done mapset that deserves a spot for this monthly chart. For the note chart itself, all patterns in each difficulty fits along with the violin, 1/4  piano and percussion rhythm. To get a full combo in Another difficulty might be a little tricky because, some part become heavier with the 1/8 pattern. Overall, it plays really smooth and has great flow. Also personally speaking, playing the Another difficulty is so pleasing and fun.

- [Erio o Kamattechan - os-Uchuujin(Asterisk Makina Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/338762) by [Frim4503](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2945775)

Ayyy, a catchy song from Asterisk made into a 5k marathon.
Yes! A marathon! In 5K! For 5K lovers! Frim4503 managed to create another impressive, fun, & "Greget" 5K map. In this marathon you will find a light usage of patterns that are relatively easy to execute, but which can be still quiet a challenge for rookie and medicore players. The note chart is mainly focuses on the synthesizer and the Drum'n'Bass percussion throughout the song in a fresh way, so it's worth to try 5K maps sometimes.

**The October 2015 ranking charts will end on the 15th December 2015**. For the next month, we will elect new community members to pick their favourite beatmaps, so stay tuned!
