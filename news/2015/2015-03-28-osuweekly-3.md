*[osu!talk interview with buraimaster1234](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR-ItQJLQTE)*, an old osu! player from 2008 who has recently resurfaced.

If you're interested in seeing how an older player adapted to the new community after five year hiatus, be sure to check this out!

*[osu!talk interview with Nashmun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8I81f2Gw1s)*, a top level taiko player was finished recently.

*[There have been updates to the latest cutting edge version of osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/changelog?v=next)*. Some changes include wiimote support for taiko mode (without the Tatacon connected), addition of the Czech localizations, the ability to bind quick retry to a custom key and fixes to custom skins for mania to allow column lines to show properly when the judgement line is moved.

Have you ever been interested in keeping track of how much time you spend playing osu!? *[A program made to track your time spent in osu!, called osu!tt](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/302790&start=0)*, is a program made by *[LoliFlan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/447818)* that does just that! This little program keeps track of any time that osu! is open for you, making it quite good to keep track of your total playtime.

*[There's a new community voice question](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/314270&start=0)* that asks the community what mechanical switches they prefer for osu! use. If you want to have a say in what switches the new osu!keyboard is going to use, and what shell colours are available, you should check this out, vote, and reply!

*[osu!next has provided more information about the future of osu!](https://osunext.tumblr.com/post/114735480023/happy-friday-no-prizes-for-guessing-what-these)*, giving us a really cool look at some new profile related badges for tournaments that will show on profiles, as well as their implementation with teams!
