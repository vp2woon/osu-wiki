With our first ever osu!mania-only Beatmapping Contest coming to a close after a long wait, the results are in and the winner has been decided. This one was an osu!mania mapset only.

The competition was close and the podium was decided by only a very few points. The winner of the contest was [LordRaika](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3265023) with a score of 115 points. With just a tiny gap of 2 points, [Kuo Kyoka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596306) get 2nd place with 113 points. [Shionia-Chan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7015183) placed 3rd with 108 points respectively, only 5 points keeping them from hitting a tie for 2nd!

This map is going to be bundled with the osu! client. Additionally, the winner receives 6 months of supporter and the "Elite Mapper" title for their user profile. For those who would like to play it right now, you can find it [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/385056). Make sure you give it a go, as the map definitely earned its first place score.

If you want to know the judges comments and the results of the other mappers, you can take a look at them [on the results page](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/contestresults/?c=20).

Congratulations to the winning mapper!
