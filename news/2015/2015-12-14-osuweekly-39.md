The [osu! World Cup 2015](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/OWC_2015) has just ended with the Grand finals taking place last weekend between USA and China. USA had to win two battles due to coming to the loser brackets, lowering their chances of winning the whole thing. Not to fret, USA pulled in their first match win with a score of 7-2. The second match came relatively close. However, with both teams having 6 points; the competition was led to an exciting tiebreaker match. USA won the tiebreaker match, and became  the first country outside of Asia to win the tournament. Please give a huge Thank you to all the tournament staff for their time in organizing such a great tournament; hopefully, there will be more awesome tournaments like this to come. Congratulations to USA and China! Both teams should be incredibly proud of themselves for making it through to the finals.

As the winners are now known; the prizes are revealed. Here's the breakdown:

- 1st place winners will get $320 each ($2600 total), a profile badge and the user title "osu! champion".
- 2nd place winners will get $240 each ($1900 total) and a profile badge.
- 3rd place winners will get $80 each ($640) and a profile badge.

The editor has gotten slightly better with an [update to the osu! Editor](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/135023739018/20151212), thanks to the [TheVileOne](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/TheVileOne).
