- Do not create teams in advance! Teams will be formed after registration phase concluded by country's team captains.
- Submit your registration until **20th December 2015**.

Note that you can only participate if you are of a **osu!mania global ranking of #5000 or higher** and **did not violate the [osu! community rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months**.

If your registration was successful, you will be put on the candidate list of your country. Whenever a captain for your country has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

_Remember that any registrations past the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances - so get your registrations done early to avoid any last-minute issues._
