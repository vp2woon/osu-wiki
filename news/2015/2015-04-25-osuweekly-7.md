Hello everyone, Tasha here! Hope everyone's been having a good week. With the small break between world cups and events things have been a little quiet, but there's still more than enough going on in the world of osu! to let you guys know about!

**[Applications for Beatmap Nominator Group are now open!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1N6RJVVglTU2k8DMiEtmQwlAfsaU7pJAdyW_u3U5bSXM/closedform)** If you have been a contributing, helpful modder and want to be part of this team, be sure to check this out and apply! You can also recommend a modder with this form, so if you know someone who you feel should be part of this team, you can fill this form out for them as well. Applications close May 2'nd, so be sure to get your applications in before then!

**[The registrations for the Catch the Beat World Cup are officially over](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/316279)**, and what a roster of teams we have! The CWC attracted 32 different countries this year, having a tie with OWC for the amount of teams participating. If you're interested in the different players playing for each country, you can **[take a look at the team rosters on the CWC wiki page](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2015#participants)**. Good luck to all teams who entered!

Did you make a map for the **[9th Monthly Beatmapping Contest?](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-04-13-monthly-beatmapping-contest-9-taiko-only)** Don't forget to **[submit your difficulties](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/contest/?c=18)** for Storm World before the 28'th of April or your mapset will not be included for judging! Here's hoping we have some good submissions for the contest!

**[The group stage for the Skandinavian osu! Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/314817)**, a 2v2 osu!standard tournament organized by **[\-Tochi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3664366)**, is starting this weekend. This tournament is a worldwide tournament despite its name, meaning not just Scandinavian players are participating. The matches will be held and streamed live between 10:00 to 16:00 UTC, so be sure to tune in to **[one](https://www.twitch.tv/viggo_tico)** of the **[two](https://www.twitch.tv/monzerious)** streams cheer for your favourite teams!

Just like last week, we have another top player video! this one was made by **[Chaoslitz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3621552)**, showing **[Hong Kong's top 20 players of 2014 based on performance points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd9kaSkcApc)**. If you want to see some impressive plays from Hong Kong's top players of 2014, check this video out!

**[osu!academy has released a revamped video to teach new players about multiplayer basics and the online users panel!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPTLyG7O8ak)** If you're new to the world of osu! and want to learn all about playing with your friends and how to tell what your friends are doing online, then this video is just for you!

**[osu!next has released more sneak peeks of the future of osu!](http://osunext.tumblr.com/post/117238702913/today-6-images-its-a-in-game-screen-that-im)** and it sure is looking like the future is good! The new screen that unfortunately flyte can not fully reveal shows some very cool features, including a performance point graph in game and what appears to be a new stylish look for the scoreboards.

Are you one of those eager people waiting for osu! to go open source? That might be a fair amount of time away from now, but you can always **[take a look at the unofficial open source osu! project](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/221726&start=0)** started and maintained by community developer **[euphyy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2936932)** called **[opsu!](http://itdelatrisu.github.io/opsu/)**. The open source osu! client is written in Java, meaning it is cross-platform compatible! It even has **[an android port done by github user fluddokt](https://github.com/fluddokt/opsu)**. Definitely take a look at this if you're interested in programming (or just want to play osu! on your android phone)!

That's all this week. There should be plenty more news this upcoming week, including things like CWC and other events, so be sure to read next week's osu!weekly. Last but not least, don't forget that if you have any osu! related news you'd like to share with others in osu!weekly, you can send an email to [news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh) and your news may be included in the weekly!

Have a good week everyone!

â€”Tasha
