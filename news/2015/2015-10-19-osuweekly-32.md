Hey everyone, Tasha here for the 32nd edition of osu!weekly! I'd like to take the chance to welcome all the new players coming to join the game after a well known youtube celebrity made a video on the game. More on that in just a moment!

Recently, #1 most subscribed youtuber **[Pewdiepie](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw)** released a video on osu!, showing off standard, catch the beat, and mania in his usual fashion of videos. Plenty of new players have been coming to the game because of this, so be sure to be welcoming to all the newbies!

Histy Championships is coming up this weekend!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/351667&start=0)** For those interested, you can take a look at the **[current bracket](https://i.ppy.sh/2f50611336e927c47643d9f49d3c9fce2d5f4dc5/687474703a2f2f7075752e73682f6b507633472f656432313762666131332e706e67)**, as well as giving the **[Grand Finals map pool](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/4599048)** a shot and see what the participating players are going to be playing! The matches will be taking place at 14:00UTC October 23rd and October 25th on their **[live stream](http://www.twitch.tv/OHC2015)**. Be sure to check it out!

**[The semifinals for TWC:LMS Single Player Edition are also taking place this weekend!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/366482&start=0)** This is a taiko mode tournament based off the Last Man Standing tournaments previously held, but single player based instead of team based, bringing an interesting twist to the already unique tournament concept. **[The schedule for the matches can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pphm9cZYn68ZpgMCSVnt38zZNUKy_V_2ob6g4mkn4Jg)**, so be sure to find out when the matches are being played to **[tune in on their stream!](http://www.twitch.tv/taikoworldcuplms)**

**[osu!idol is coming to an end with the final round taking place now!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/352608&start=0)** This year however **[the final round has two unique twists](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/4594772)**. The first is that judges are not going to be the deciding factor for the finalist's entries, it will instead be you, the community! The second twist is that the finalists can do any special effects and editing that they choose, which throughout the contest has not been allowed until now. **[Sagi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Sagi)**, **[CptHampton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/cpthampton)** and last year's osu!idol winner **[yealina](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/yealina)** are this years finalists. Who do you guys think has what it takes to win it all? The finalist submission deadline is October 31st, so we won't have to wait long to find out!

**[El Capitan OS X users rejoice, as there has been a stable release that works with El Capitan!](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/131216236188/20151015)** All following updates for OSX can be found from **[osx.ppy.sh](https://osx.ppy.sh/)**, so it'd be a good idea to keep tabs on that website. **[You can find the current installer here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16332218/osu%21-20151017.dmg)**, so check it out if you're running on a Mac!

**[While osu!next was quiet last week, this week we do get some new sneak peeks, this time looking into updates to profiles as well as profile badges](https://next.ppy.sh/post/131272085198/im-working-all-over-the-place-now-updating)**. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm really looking forward to seeing all the stuff we've been seeing from osu!next going live.

This week we have two top players to mention for their incredible achievements. First off osu!mania player **[jhlee0133](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/140148)** has **[managed to break 11,000 performance points with 11,054 performance points total](/wiki/shared/news/2015-10-19-osuweekly-32/ss+(2015-10-19+at+09.35.57).png)**, being the first player to do this in osu!mania and the second overall (**[ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/ExGon)** with 11,405 in Catch the Beat). The second notable player this week was **[Axarious](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Axarious)** with an absolutely mind-boggling performance on the "**[Maffalda - pensamento tipico de esquerda caviar [Gangsta]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/422328)**" with Double Time, getting 549 performance points from the play and breaking the 9000 performance point mark. Check out the amazing replay of the score below!
