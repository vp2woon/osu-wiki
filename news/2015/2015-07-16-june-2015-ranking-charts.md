The Ranking Charts for June 2015 have just been released and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH15006)!

This month [Kyubey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2195646), [Senritsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1165368), [Yami Shoujo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1978891) and [Kuo Kyoka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596306) picked the maps for the Monthly Ranking Charts.

## Ranking Charts Creation

The charts have previously been created by letting four dedicated community members select the most noteworthy maps of this month. We also reward the top beatmap in each category by providing **1 month of supporter status** to the mapper.

### osu!

For osu!, we decided to let **[Kyubey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2195646)** pick their favourite maps.

- **[Sawai Miku - Colorful. (Asterisk DnB Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/299454) by [Amamiya Yuko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/873961)**

You gotta love Megumi after playing that map. It just ephasizes almost every aspect of the song, making your hands move by themself, while you listening to that sweet drum'n'bass-remixed song. Moreover, Amamiya Yuko shows us not only the great mapping concept, but also a nice hitsounding ideas. I bet you are going to be surprised to know this song does not have a piano part at all. But these melodic sounds fit the song perfectly and feel like a part of the music itself, and if you manage to miss on that easy part, you probably will act like «Eh? I was pretty sure there should be a piano note». By the way, do not forget to check the 2B difficulty linked in the creator words to get even better experience with some impressing patterns that reveal the whole song's potential!

- [Memme - Chinese Restaurant](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/244799) by [Muya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/153323)

Do you want to visit a chinese restaurant? I've never been there, so I do. Sharp as a knife patterns in this map follow the sharpness of that atmospheric song perfectly, and small circles just emphasize it. You move your cursor like you actually swing the knife, and following these not really spaced sharp and curved streams contrast that movement really good. Warning, this music is pretty attractive and can make you want to play that map more and more.

- [Cutos - Prospect](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/286458) by [Reiji-RJ](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/305389)

Welcome the winner of the first Russian Beatmapping Contest! And believe me, Reiji-RJ got that title not for nothing. Their amazing style is pretty known among the old mappers and players, but we haven't seen that many d'n'b tracks mapped by RJ. And, after receiving that map, we realized that style can fit just everything, even such an unusual drum'n'bass music. These sharp and curved sliders, almost always following same angle, these custom stacks, everything looks really neat and cool. Congratulations, Reiji, you deserve it!

- [HoneyWorks - Miraizu feat.Aida Miou(CV:Toyosaki Aki)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/306591) by [Fycho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1876867)

If you got tired of listening to electronic music, this sweet song is definitely what do you need! Flowing and jumpy map that follows and ephasizes the song feels so good, making you be charged with that voice's happiness and encourages you to go and beat everyone in the osu! ranking. Yes, Fycho did a great job here, providing to us such an awesome map with the same song. By the way, this map has a secret! Good luck trying to find it (even if it's not that hard though)!

- [Camellia - dreamless wanderer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/286414) by [Amamiya Yuko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/873961)

Didn't I mention Amamiya Yuko shows us really great hitsounding ideas? They just find samples that not only fit the track, but even make it new, different to original, so you don't even notice them while playing because you think this is a part of the music. But Yuko continues to surprise us, they show a really impressive idea to change the sound of sliderslide to make it different and fitting the song in the different moments. And it sounds really cool, trust me! Not only the hitsounding, but object placement also looks awesome. Have you noticed that drumstep starts to become popular in osu?! It's also pretty hard to map, but Amamiya Yuko shows us, how should it be mapped, revealing the whole track's potential with awesome slider shapes and speed changes. This is what makes drumstep maps different.

- [Pierce The Veil - King For A Day (feat Kellin Quinn)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/297909) by [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418)

This map has difficulties. A lot of them. A REALLY lot. Almost every average player can find a difficulty for their level here, and all of them are made pretty well, challenging ones or easier ones. But not only the amount of difficulties impressed me. I'm personally not a fan of English songs or songs with male vocals, but this track sounds really beautiful and appealing to me. I don't know what could I say about this map much, it just feels really good, and makes you want to play every difficulty of it.

### Taiko

For Taiko, we asked **[Senritsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1165368)** about their favourite maps in May 2015.

- **[Jimmy Weckl - Icicles](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/96115) by [OzzyOzrock](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/465153)**

Relaxing map with relaxing song, not only hard difficulties, the easier difficulties also mapped really clean and even though the spacing is different, it's still understandable for players. Not only it's mapped really well with finishers emphasizing the correct place and instrument, there are also streams placed on Inner which follows the instrument really well. The music is catchy, and the map supports it as well, makes it really enjoyable and fun to play.

- [Furries in a Blender - Storm World](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/319473) by [Firce777](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/274072)

Our monthly beatmap contest winner. It's mapped well, but there's a lot of same pattern being repeated all over, which may makes people bored. But put that aside, the patterns on this map follows the music and rhythm well, especially Oni, which makes the map is interesting to play.

- [MowtenDoo - El Bombito](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/239262) by [xtrem3x](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/136385)

This map caught my attention. Despite of it being a really short song, it's really fun and enjoyable. And not only that, the song itself is really catchy, so playing it is somehow fun, both Muzukashii and Oni.

- [TOKINE - Negai o Yobu Kisetsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/91882) by [Coro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/499843)

The part which i'm interested in at this map is how easier difficulty is mapped with different spacing and sufficient breaks is available. However it seems to miss some finishes on some part, which is inconsistent amongst the diff. But despite of that, this mapset, especially Oni difficulty, are really enjoyable to play and i think this map deserves to be in this chart.

- [Jamie Lynn Spears - FOLLOW ME](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/208944) by [Hanjamon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1703330)

Relaxing map with relaxing song, and it's following both music and vocal really well. Breaks are sufficient and suits the music, but i think the first part can be simpler to suits the vocal, and i think SV change is unnescessary because they're still on the same ambience. Whatever, this is a fun map to play, especially with mods to make the map more challenging and fun to play.

- [ClariS - Connect -TV MIX-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/203567) by [MMzz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/128993)

Although the pattern is common among taiko maps, it's still deserve the right to be a part of this chart I think. Well mapped, and both the Oni's are mapped in a different way, they emphasize drum and vocal way differently, but still looks good and plays good.

### Catch the Beat

For Catch the Beat, **[Yami Shoujo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1978891)** was the chosen one to declare the winners of the May 2015 beatmaps.

- **[Camellia - dreamless wanderer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/286414) by [CLSW](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/531253)**

This is something that has never been seen before, some may argue about the style of CTB has been stale lately, but this takes the mapping of a CTB difficulty to a different level. With very smooth mapping that goes extremely well with the flow of the song, along with good hit sounds, its a perfect map for highly ranked players to test how well their consistency is. This deserves number one mostly due to how unique every pattern is, as well as something fresh for the top CTB players to try.

- [Pierce The Veil - King For A Day (feat Kellin Quinn) (EX)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/297909) by [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418)

This song is really something else for converted, these type of patterns and jumps are what we CTB players love, the accuracy that is required for these jumps makes you follow along the song and move according to the rhythm of the song itself. Great slider placement that makes you not overdash if you wish for the SS rank, song is excellent to just practice your timing on jumping. Not only is EX diff excellent to play, there are even more extra diff's that are perfect for CTB converts.

- [siqlo - Forest Haze](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/281695) by [Lust](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2316951)

Enjoy having 1/4 hypers with awkwardly placed sliders at times? Want to challenge yourself for that SS? Well this map is definitely for you, these patterns start from something that comes from a typical Extra convert, not much hypers and few jumps, since its following the song it starts to gain momentum along with the mapping too, then the hard parts start to show. From difficult stacks to sliders entering 1/4 jumps, this map makes you pay attention when and where to go soon after you hit that jump, you require real precision in this and is a true challenge for a CTBers that enjoy the converted maps.

- [void feat. Komatsuna - Akatsuki no Tsuki](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/297668) by [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598)

A beautiful mapset that are just full of great guest difficulties that compliment Oriental diff. Oriental was originally featured in the CWC 2015, and for good reason, this difficulty follows a great flow that keeps you moving, with streams and sliders that makes you react properly, the flow in this is just insanely fluid, there may be a lot of FC's, but that's just how well and smooth you can play this diff. A great diff to challenge CTBers that are trying to enter the overdose diff scene.

- [Studio EIM - Crescent Moon Island Boss Theme](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/173422) by [Rakuen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2426126)

Now this song is something unique as a convert, from beginning to end, this song keeps you going catching all the stream notes. Now in general, streamy songs for std converted into CTB become much easier doesn't it? Well for this song having a CS of five, the patterns are more spaced out and makes you move a lot more rather than just standing and catching all the notes. With some difficult patterns that makes you move your catcher in a stuttering motion, it requires skill to catch some of these stacks, great hitsounding to emphasis on a epic feel of the song as well.

- [M2U - The Queen](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/255039) by [WildOne94](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3482692)

A great mapset that really makes you enjoy a song. Razor overdose may be one of the easier diffs out of this list, but its far from it actually being easy to play. Having you to move according to sliders and having some moments where you stand, then jump and stand again to fully get every droplet, it makes you accurately understand how far you must go to perfectly catch all the droplets from a slider.

### osu!mania

For osu!mania, **[Kuo Kyoka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596306)** was able to select their personal most noteworthy beatmap from last month.

- **[Camellia feat. Nanahira - Songs Compilation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/300721) by [Rinzler](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2133381)**

Now this is a brilliant approved mapset by Rinzler! Despite having only 1 difficulty, the difficulty gradually increases, making it a lot more welcoming for newer players. The BPM throughout the map is very high (192 - 256). And this map brings us a bunch of various patterns that makes the map really enjoyable, such as streams, bursts, and a quite a few fun jacks near the end of the map! If you're someone who enjoys songs by Camellia, dubstep (or even loli) you should definitely try this map. What are you waiting for!? This map is definitely the #1 chart of June 2015.

- [Vospi - Reverence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/203929) by [Nivrad00](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1984634)

Ah ~ A song from Cytus, definitely a nice choice with a great 7K mapset to go with it! This song has a lot of piano, so the chart is definitely very pitch inclined, but somehow this doesn't take away from the playability of the patterns as they are all really smooth to play. Also I very much like the way Nivrad00 mapped purely to piano on the Normal diff, giving it a really nice feel. Definitely recommended for those who like piano songs.

- [Tsubaki - Kyun Kyun Tamaran Inaba-tan.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/312780) by [Zan -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1411817)

Did you hear a loli's voice ~ ? Zan - picked a light-hearted fun song to map, and done so very well! With guest difficulties from Ichigaki and \[Shana Lesus\], in my opinion Ichigaki's difficulty is definitley worth a try - great usage of long notes, mixed in with 1/8 notes, excellent pitch relevancy, and even some jacks, which combined all make it actually really fun to play. The easier difficulties are also very well made, they are all very comfortable and each of the patterns are polished and smooth.

- [Hypernite Industries - Speedcore 300](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/228853) by [nowsmart](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1935034)

"Speedcore 300" : looking at this title's name, I'm pretty sure you can imagine the BPM. It's been a very long time we've seen a really fast BPM map ranked nowadays - although this doesn't particularly contribute to how hard it is. In fact, this mapset really has a great spread, starting off with a difficulty of 1.37*! Newer players can definitely train up with this mapset. The storyboard is also pretty nice too, it definitely contributes to the mood of the song. Extra difficulty has an extreme amount of bursts and jacks though, so definitely beware! So prepare your keyboard!

- [LiSA - Rally Go Round -TV ver.-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/303649) by [DrawdeX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2228215)

One of my favourite songs from Nisekoi: - And DrawdeX brings us a very full mapset from Easy to Insane with both
4K and 7K! Definitely recommended for newer players and it has a wide spread to satisfy everyone's taste. The main finish and clap samples actually fit really well throughout the mapset as they're simple but they fit with the song so well. Although, let's not forget how nicely structured all the patterns are in every single difficulty - especially in Ayano's 4K MX and 7K HD! The LNs are placed very well and it feels very satisfying to play. I hope I can see more mapsets from the creator in the future!

- [nora2r - B.B.K.K.B.K.K. (Extended Mix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/311403) by [Marirose](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1899763)

An extended version of the popular B.B.K.K.B.K.K. song from BMS - And Marirose brings us a great 4K marathon mapset for this song! I definitely like the originality in some of the patterns within this map, they're definitely enjoyable and fit the song very well. The layering is executed very well and the overall structure of the beatmap is clear. Very nice chart from Marirose and I really hope to see more maps like this from them! LET THE BASS KICK!

**The June 2015 ranking charts will end on the 15th August 2015**. For the next month, we will elect new community members to pick their favourite beatmaps, so stay tuned!
