With some delay, the Ranking Charts for September 2015 have just been released and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1509)!

This month [Secretpipe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2208964), [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766), [Krah](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1436748) and [-Kamikaze-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783) picked the maps for the Monthly Ranking Charts.

## Ranking Charts Creation

The charts have previously been created by letting four dedicated community members select the most noteworthy maps of this month. We also reward the top beatmap in each category by providing **1 month of supporter status** to the mapper.

### osu!

For osu!, we decided to let **[Secretpipe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2208964)** pick their favourite maps.

- **[Koven - Get This Right](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/347947) by [Aiceo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4453280)**

This is the example of a good map: In line with a catchy song and various mapping styles, this map succeeds to link challenge and pleasure to play. Rich in drums, this song allows the usage of several rhythms and makes it possible to map a wide range of difficulties! Also, the vocals and the drums are perfectly covered by the wonderful hitsounds. The spread is also very diversified and sophisticated, which should delight any player searching for challenge or a difficulty suited for them.

- [Feint - Vagrant (feat. Veela)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/354792) by [appleeaterx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2407160)

The Art of mapping. If some maps are amazing because of the pick of the song or the mapping, this one is because of both. The Liquid Drum and Bass is marvelously mapped by the creator. Even if the song makes us living a unique experience, the difficulty is here. The spread, composed of 4 difficulties, is perfect for any player who would like to adapt to the difficulty of his choice.

- [Reol - Asymmetry](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/310499) by [Skystar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/873961)

It's pretty hard to miss the last success of Skystar and -\[Koinuri\]! Asymmetry of Reol is certainly one of the most remarkable maps of this month. This one has a huuuuge storyboard made by the talented -\[Koinuri\]. There's both realistic animations and uniques difficulties, this map is a real experience between the song and the visual look.

- [EGOIST - Ame, Kimi o Tsurete](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/346301) by [monstrata](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2706438)

What could I say about this map except that it deserve its place in charts? I bet you all know monstrata now! He handles perfectly his mapping style and adapts it to every kind of difficulty. If you already had the occasion to listen musics of EGOIST, this map should be good for you.

- [xi - Wish upon twin Stars](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/242462) by [Chaoslitz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3621552)

xi's songs never disappoints? Don't worry, this map doesn't disappoint! Chaoslitz grades at 5th place of these charts because of an exceptional work made here. If we usually know xi maps for endless streams and a challenge never already made, the creator proves the opposite because we have here a very, verrrrrry fun map that use perfectly the rhythms without overmapping the song.

- [Hellblinde - Above the Clouds](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/344252) by [[ Rizen ]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3056732)

A little surprise? Yes! I was really surprised by \[ Rizen \]'s map, a new mapper that comes with one of his first maps! Mapping Helblinde? A little bit too much "aggressive" for the beginning? Well none of that, the style of the map is more like Liquid DnB and the atmosphere very calm. Having tested the map, I think he would make a pretty wonderful mapper.

### Taiko

For Taiko, we asked **[Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766)** about their favourite maps in September 2015.

- **[sakuzyo - AXION](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/57468) by [lepidopodus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/194807)**

My favorite map this month is by lepidopodus! Having years of experience he made a map that is very well structured, well-mapped and fun to play! Its streams are good for practising because of the 160 BPM and is a challenge to both Hidden and Hard Rock. The lower difficulties are also a good challenge for their respective skill level since they are on the higher end while not being too hard, again due to the very good structure and rhythm. I can only recommend playing this at least once. Also, who could not resist that cute smiling background.

- [Rameses B - Mountains (Ft. Veela)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/324772) by [SKSalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3280542)

A very solid set from Kantan to Inner Oni. All difficulties are well-mapped and play well to the song, making the lower difficulties even a bit different from your occasional Kantan! The Inner Oni also impresses by being simple yet interesting to play due to its good patterns. While the song only lasts 1 minute it still gives you a nice experience.

- [u's - Datte Datte Aa Mujou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/642555) by [Nardoxyribonucleic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/876419)

I assume that especially after the Catch the Beat World Cup quite a few people should know that I'm not a fan of Love Live songs. But I must admit that this one is quite nice, as is the map. Playing it the first time I didn't even notice 5 minutes, which happens rarely. But the map has a lot of fun sections so you don't notice the length!

- [Uesaka Sumire - Inner Urge TV size mix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/351410) by [Nofool](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/672430)

The easiest map of the charts is a set by French mapper Nofool! The catchy tune of Inner Urge resulted in a quite nice map with solid patterns and - hold your breath - a drum roll. It's also a fun map with all mods so go try it with Double Time, Hard Rock or, if you want to practise it a little bit since this map is really recommended for it, Hidden. I guarantee it's fun whatever mods you (don't) use! I feel like you slowly have an inner urge to play the chart maps finally instead of reading this... don't worry, it's only two more maps.

- [Kano - Houkago Stride](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/289985) by [OzzyOzrock](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/465153)

High BPM madness! Backfire and OzzyOzrock offer you the long version of Houkago Stride, my favorite song in this chart, with very solid and pattern-based maps! While the 3rd kiai might be overdoing it a little bit, the other parts of OzzyOzrock's map definitely make up for it. And if you aren't used to high BPM yet, Backfire's Oni gives you a map that allows enough breaks and easier patterns to enjoy the song without having to be able to tap 225 BPM 1/4 perfectly on the Inner Oni.

- [Feint - Reprise](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/324058) by [_Gezo_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/481582)

Last but not least we've got another drum'n'bass song, Reprise, mapped by _Gezo_! While the song is by far not something really interesting due to its repetitive nature, his difficulty slowly evolves and rises in difficulty and complexity as minor changes in the song occur, having some quite difficult patterns towards the end. He managed to make this a nice experience which is hard to accomplish. And as a reprise you could play the first map(s) again.

### Catch the Beat

For Catch the Beat, **[Krah](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1436748)** was the chosen one to declare the winners of the September 2015 beatmaps.

- **[Nekomata Master - Avalon no oka](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/218623) by [Intensity](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3072921)**

If you are only interested by pp no need to stop here. This map is the proof that hyperdashes was never the only way to create difficulty. But to begin let's not forget the rest of the spread with a well made Rain by Badis and an interesting hard Platter by Crystal. And then we have the Overdose who is clearly not the easiest kind of difficulty to make since it require an important skill to manage to combine breaks without ruining the flow but with this complicated mapping come a well-made (and complicated too) difficulty. As Badis said "You won't find pp here, only challenge." and it's actually true for the whole difficulty spread.

- [sakuzyo - AXION](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/57468) by [DaxMasterix](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/264914)

I seriously hesitated between this one and the previous one because they are both the example that there isn't only one kind of CtB mapping in 2015. It's clearly the long awaited ranked map of this month since it was a part of the Catch the Beat World Cup 2015 final mappool but already in 2014. A bit tricky for those who never played those "old" CtB maps it is the kind where you feel proud after you fc'd it. Stay focused during all of it or you are gonna instantly miss.

- [Apocalyptica - Hall of the Mountain King](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/340399) by [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418)

I always liked those songs with an increasing bpm so this was most likely obvious for me. The first version of  Hall of the Mountain King that pishifat ranked was already a nice and challenging convert and this one is of the same kind. Stay focused till the end because it will go faster and faster and faster.

- [Hige Driver join. SELEN - Dadadadadadadadadada](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/350076) by [CLSW](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/531253)

If you enjoy most of recent maps you will enjoy this one too. The EX difficulty is an interesting challenge for most of players (and even just to clear it) but the SHD and the rest of the spread is designed to be playable by all. It's not a map who will be a surprise if you are already well accustomed with CLSW's maps or recent maps but it's well made and totally enjoyable.

- [Hylian Lemon - Foresight Is for Losers](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/342751) by [ZiRoX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/200768)

So here it is, the winning entry of the CtB second Monthly Beatmapping Contest. It doesn't go with current standard so spread could look easy but it will still provide an interesting challenge to a lot of players. The collab rain is a quite nice collab (because let's not forgot Deif too here) and it relative low AR will let to the best players a possibility to Double Time it and to probably even fc it like that.

- [Nishiura Tomohito - Omoide no Teien](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/329707) by [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508)

The easiest map for this month. It will as you expect with this kind of calm song contain calm patterns. But the interesting part with low bpm songs is that you tend to notice more the hitsounds and the one here are simple but work nicely. A nice choice if you are beginner or just want to relax a bit.

### osu!mania

For osu!mania, **[-Kamikaze-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783)** was able to select their personal most noteworthy beatmap from last month.

- **[S-C-U feat. Qrispy Joybox - anemone](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/283841) by [Julie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2420987)**

There are mapsets with 1 keymode. There are mapsets with 2 keymodes. But it's really rare to find a mapset with 5 keymodes. Yet, here we have one of them! Anemone offers a wide variety of difficulties for everyone to enjoy. It's really solid and rigid structure at places makes it rather easy to play, but challenging to fully master. Not to mention the two awesome Extra difficulties done in collaboration with KawaEE, which in my opinion are a cherry on top of the cake. With addition of piano keysounds, this is a must have mapset for all mania players!

- [Ryu* Vs. Sota - Go Beyond!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/187154) by [DE-CADE](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3734394)

The map I've waited for to be ranked since MWC 2014, where 4K Hyper+ was selected to be played in group stages. A rather fast, not too complicated map for 4 and 7 keys that has captured hearts of many people. Chordstreams, jumpstreams, well executed SVs, fast stairs, LNs, doublestairs, jumptrills, you will find that all here. A really intense beatmap that fully deserves it's spot on this month's chart.

- [sakuzyo - Altale](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/347779) by [Kuo Kyoka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596306)

Beautiful song. Beautiful video. Beautiful chart. I present to you the masterpiece that's named Altale. Just looking at this chart makes you want to play it. Patterning looks really smooth, and feels incredible to play. The way patterns flow is just... magnificent. Difficulty of this chart mainly resolves around fast 1/12 stairs with jumps every so often which are surprisingly easy to hit, even despite how fast they are. The mesmerising thing is that even when layering is that dense, it doesn't feel overdone. It doesn't feel forced. It compliments the song perfectly. And for that reason I selected this chart to be here.

- [Mami Kawada - Wings of Courage -Sora o Koete-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/312601) by [-[ AmiShici ]-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5335322)

This map was the biggest surprise for me in this month. I expected a rather dull easy map, but it turned out to be a very pleasant and challenging chart. This is a calm, 160 BPM 6K map, that's mostly constructed around usage of a single long note, a lot of shorter ones, and some chords inbetween. It doesn't feel dull, it doesn't feel overdone, nor it's too hard for what the song calls for. Even though it's not a high-end map, it still gives players a lot of challenge to S/FC/SS accordingly. Really solid mapset, that I would definitely show to anyone who yearns for some fresh 6K charts.

- [DJ Mashiro - Prismatic Lollipops](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/317255) by [Shinzo-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4720038)

The hardest 9K map ranked so far. A fun and happy song, with enjoyable map that (I hope) will bring more players to 9K. This map doesn't follow traditional pop'n charting style, but it does a very good job of representing the flow of the song. It's also balanced on fingers really well which makes it a good training for any other 9K maps that might be ranked in future. I do believe that this map is a step in the right direction for still young 9K.

- [Gotou Mai - Funwari Fuwari](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/333217) by [shionelove](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/501551)

A very unique mapset in it's own right. The mapset mainly focuses on tricky LN patterning throughout whole song apart from HD difficulty which for contrast is mapped in BMS style. While the song is slow and star rating is rather low, this map, especially yoshilove's Uryu~
difficulty are very hard to hit accurately due to very unique and complex long note patterns, slowdowns and gimmicks that aren't common for mania maps (especially those ranked ones). Can't LN? Let's practice LN~~

**The September 2015 ranking charts will end on the 15th November 2015**. For the next month, we will elect new community members to pick their favourite beatmaps, so stay tuned!
