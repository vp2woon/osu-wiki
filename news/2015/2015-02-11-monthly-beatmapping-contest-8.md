Submissions for the 8th Monthly Beatmapping Contest are now open - with a special **winter** theme for this month's contest, and all-new changes to the format of the monthly contests to spice things up a bit!

We'll be trialing out a new concept of rotating between gamemodes in future contests, to try and encourage more people to get involved in the multitude of rhythm experiences that osu! has to offer. We'll be starting with the **standard** gamemode this month to kick things off.

Taking a bit of a break from the fast-paced songs found in previous contests, this month's choice is a calm, downtempo stroll through one of the slower pieces we've featured thus far. The song is performed by the talented **raja_ffm**, and is titled "**the light**". Listen to it below:

## What are the prizes?

- 6 months of supporter for you or a friend!
- 'Elite Mapper' forum title
- **Winning mapset will be bundled with the osu! game client download!**

## What are the rules?

- You must map 3 difficulties in an appropriate spread - either ENH (easy, normal and hard) or NHI (normal, hard, insane).
- Collaboration is allowed, but will only be registered under the name of the person who submitted the beatmap. Prizes for a winning mapset will only be given to the uploader.
- Difficulty names must only be the name of the respective difficulty, and nothing else. No ztrot's Hard or anything comparable.
- Maps submitted to the contest must not be submitted to the BSS until the contest has concluded.

## Where can I enter?

Submit your creations **[here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/contest/?c=17)**

The deadline for submission is the **March 8th 2015**. Make sure you submit early and be prepared - we won't be accepting late submissions!
