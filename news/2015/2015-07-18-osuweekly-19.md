**[The registrations for the 2015 4K Mania World Cup have now opened!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-07-12-osumania-4k-world-cup-2015-registrations-open)** Registrations will be open until the 2nd of August. Keep in mind that registrations are individual now and not team based, so if you're interested in playing, are within the top 5000 and haven't broken the **[osu! community rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Rules)** in the past year, be sure to head over to the **[registration page](https://osu.ppy.sh/tournaments/1)** and sign up! If you'd like to discuss this tournament, be sure to head over to the **[discussion topic](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/345431)** on the forums, where plenty of new information will be posted up as it becomes available.

**[The Just For Fun Summer Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/342876)** hosted by **[Alpharomeo66](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6508124)** will be coming up this Sunday, July 19th! This 1v1 tournament is for players 50,000 and above, so the maps will be more suited to players at this rank. There is no prizes for this tournament, though it is a great chance for newer players to give a tournament a chance, so be sure to sign up and give this a shot!

Another tournament being hosted for lower ranked players is the **[IGZ Summer Open](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/346427)** hosted by **[tbag188](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4550854)**. This 1v1 tournament allows players ranked 50,000 to 120,000 to participate, and will consist of a **[group stage](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UZ9cAYVuWijJjZoGqcO-EPYpPFkfkXwZEQ_utNhveYI/edit#gid=0)** and single elimination bracket stage. Registrations for this tournament close on the 18th of July and starts on the 19th, so you'll have to be quick to register to this!

**[The June 2015 Ranking Charts are now available for play!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-07-16-june-2015-ranking-charts)** **[Kyubey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2195646)**, **[Senritsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1165368)**, **[Yami Shoujo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1978891)** and **[Kuo Kyoka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596306)** were the map selectors for each mode this time around, there being plenty of fun maps to try out this month! The results for the May 2015 Ranking Charts are also available with **[[Toy]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689)**, **[Nishizumi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2496768)**, **[Dusk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533210)** and **[S h i r o](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/766374)** being the  winners for their respective modes, netting them each 1 month of supporter.

**[The osu!talk discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tICLLkOlpno)** featuring **[peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/peppy)** and **[flyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/flyte)** mentioned last week was made available this week! This discussion went over plenty of different questions, and covered some of the upcoming features and plans being brought to osu!next. This osu!talk is definitely one you want to listen to, don't miss out!

Are you interested in being part of the group of people who helps out with testing cutting edge, contributing resources to the game, developing your own apps with the API or just working with the team to help improve osu! as a whole? Awesome! **[On July 15th, peppy has opened up a new public slack channel where you can help with these things!](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/124145059058/20150715-slack)** Please keep in mind that this is not for people to bug the developer team with account appeals. If you do that, you will be removed from the slack and have your appeal duration increased a significant amount. Be sure to read the blog post above before **[signing up](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/slack)** to join the slack team.

Other than the slack announcement on the 15th, peppy has been keeping up with his **[blog](https://blog.ppy.sh/)**. This week on the **[13th](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/123968773293/20150713)** and **[14th](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/124068999953/20150714)** it was mostly Q&A covering various questions asked throughout the week. The 15th was the blog post **[announcing a public dev slack](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/124145059058/20150715-slack)**, of which more information can be found above. The 17th however went over a pretty important topic that many people are interested in, which is the **[next public release of osu!](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/124270196183/20150716)**, which will replace stable with the OpenGL implementation of osu, aiming to remove any windows dependencies for OS X compatibility. The blog post goes over the issues remaining that are preventing this release, and mentions that the next public release may be available as early as next week!

**[This week the osu!next blog hosted by flyte showed off some cool new tshirt merchandise](https://next.ppy.sh/post/124304008243/took-a-day-off-today-pulls-blanket)** that will be available soon in the osu!store. Shirt designs include "**[spins per minute](/wiki/shared/news/2015-07-18-osuweekly-19/spm.jpg)**", "**[SS or Quit](/wiki/shared/news/2015-07-18-osuweekly-19/ssquit.jpg)**" and surely to be a favourite, "**[What the firetruck](/wiki/shared/news/2015-07-18-osuweekly-19/fire.jpg)**?" which will all hopefully be available soon!

There's no new entrants into the highly exclusive 10000pp club this week, but we do have two players who are getting extremely close to that mark. osu!mania player **[jhlee0133](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/140148)** is currently sitting at 9,942pp, leaving him only 58pp from the 10000pp goal. Right behind him is CTB player **[Dusk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533210)** who is currently at 9,832pp, leaving them only 168pp away. Which of these two players do you think will make this goal first? Let us know in the comments!

With that, we're done with the news this week! As always you can send any news you'd like to be represented in the osu!weekly to **[news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh)** and I will do my best to include that information. Have a fantastic weekend!
