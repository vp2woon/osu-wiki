Hello there and welcome to another week of the osu!weekly. Tasha here hoping you've all had a pleasant week and that it continues into the weekend. There's a few different tournaments and such running this weekend that we're gonna cover so lets get right into it!

**[The Catch the Beat World Cup quarterfinals start this weekend!](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2015)** If you were watching last week and one of your favourite countries to cheer for lost their match, fear not as the tournament is double elimination, so none of the teams were eliminated last week, only moved to losers bracket. The first match of the weekend will be on Saturday at 12pm UTC, going until 4pm UTC the same day. Sunday will feature four more matches, starting at 10am UTC and going until 1pm UTC. If you'd like to see the more detailed schedule for the matches or even the map pool for the quarterfinals, you can see them on the wiki page under **[Match Schedule](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2015#tournament-schedule)** or **[Map pools](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2015#mappools)**. Be sure to tune in to watch the winners bracket teams compete to stay in the bracket, and the losers bracket teams fight to stay in CWC!

**[The second unofficial TWC, also known as Taiko World Cup: Last Man Standing 2, has its quarterfinal matches happening this week.](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/311318)** If you enjoyed the Taiko World Cup, this cup also shows some of the same players who participated in the official Taiko World Cup, just under the unique "life" system provided in LMS. I'd definitely recommend taking a look at the **[schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11G1I20DlJsbXGykgH9xM1c96TdgYHOQa1dXyf75LfOo/edit#gid=858167302)** and checking out their **[stream](https://www.twitch.tv/taikoworldcuplms)** over the weekend.

**[The winner of the Osu China & Taiwan Tournament has been decided.](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/284495)** The team to win it all was team Arsecrackers after beating both team Taose Nai Yo (**[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g7cgevna00)**) and then team Can't Be Serious (**[video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifduh-6KwaM)** / **[video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8M65zR3lTs)** / **[video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2Xc7V73gM)**) in the finals. A **[post tournament interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gVdNXwMa_E)** featuring the winning team was done, so if you're interested in the reaction of all the players on the team, you should check it out. Congrats to all the players on the winning team... and I hope they're enjoying their new shiny profile badges!

**[The April 2015 monthly charts are now live.](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1504)** Players **[Cherry Blossom](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1156742)**, **[Nashmun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/49031)**, **[Zak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375955)** and **[Starry-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2166199)** are the map selectors for this month, and at for the maps I played, I'd say they definitely made some good choices. If you'd like to see why they chose certain songs, the **[official news post](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-05-18-april-2015-monthly-ranking-charts)** goes into more detail for that with comments on each song chosen. Make sure to get your best scores on the chart songs before the 15'th of June to go for first place! While on the topic of charts, the March 2015 charts winners have been decided, players **[jantan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/887924)**, **[tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767)**, **[Dusk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533210)** and **[Cryolien](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1626983)** all placing first in their respective modes earning them one month of supporter. Congratulations you guys!

Last week flyte posted up images showing a window of his working environment, wondering if anyone who could guess just what it was. **[Turns out a user in the comments section guessed correctly](/wiki/shared/news/2015-05-23-osuweekly-11/ss+(2015-05-22+at+08.04.58).jpg)** and as a result, **[flyte posted up a must see video showing just exactly what it was he was working on.](http://osunext.tumblr.com/post/119591510223/since-someone-managed-to-guess-last-weeks-teaser)** I won't spoil anything it shows, but I'll definitely say you guys will love this one as it shows quite a bit in this small clip.

A month ago **[Shurelia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3807986)** and **[Niva](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/197805)** announced that they would be **[running an osu! stand at the Telkom University](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/321810&start=0)** during the event **[Nihon no Matsuri 8](https://twitter.com/nihonnomatsuri)**. The event has since ended two weeks ago, and was a big success. There were several different events, including liveplays, 1v1 matches, slider art showcasing and map showcasing for various Indonesian mappers. **[A discussion topic opened following the event was opened up as well,](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/326919)** so if you want to participate in the discussion or check out some of the videos from the event be sure to check it out!

While not everyone may download map packs due to various reasons, this small tool created by **[Faishal Akbar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2061007)** called **[osu!Mappack Unpacker](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/310910)** is rather useful for those who would like to download map packs and have the process be a little simpler, especially for those not familiar with how to properly unpack the beatmap packs into osu. You can download the program **[here](https://github.com/mfaishalakbar/osumappackunpacker/releases)** and can find beatmap packs to download using this program from the **[official website's Beatmap Packs section](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/packlist)**.

**[The next episode of the osu!talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stWmOmJgmLE)** is an interview with **[p3n](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/123703)**, one of the staff managers of osu!. This video goes into a discussion covering various interests people have, such as the new modding system with the BNG / QAT, snippets about modding in general and where the mapping community is headed, as well as covering how things are now compared to how they were in the past, also talking about how the new system is aiming to be future proof. If you're interested in any of these topics (or just want to get to know p3n a little better!)**, go have a listen on youtube!

That's all for osu!weekly this time everyone. Remember if you have any news you'd like to see included in the weekly (or on our youtube channel **[osu!news](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZKQIqv9O2tddMNUMAxWaqQ)**), be sure to send us an email at **[news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh)** so that we can share your news with everyone! Hope to see you all during the CWC!
