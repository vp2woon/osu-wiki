Tasha here with another digest of the osu!weekly! There's been a lot going on between CWC and new upcoming content, so lets get right into it!

**[The Catch the Beat World Cup has come to an end!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-06-16-osu-catch-the-beat-world-cup-2015-results)** South Korea took first place with a very impressive performance against China, who took second place. Germany took third place after losing to China the previous week. If you'd like to see the grand finals, there is a **[youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvGKD6sXQDU)** of the match for everyone to see on the **[osu!live youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC04QGgpwL5b53HbMCi4TB7A)**, so go take a look if you hadn't seen the Grand Finals already!

**[The 5th osu! Indonesia Tournament is going into the semifinals this weekend.](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/329171)** This tournament is being run by **[Niva](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Niva)** and **[nya10](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/nya10)**. This tournament runs under unique rules with a single elimination "royal rumble" ruleset in place, meaning any mistakes made by players could see them out of the tournament in the blink of an eye. The tournament will be streamed on **[one](http://twitch.tv/Gatyaa)** of **[two](http://www.twitch.tv/rzkadi20)** streams, so if you want to see which Indonesian players make it the farthest, make sure to tune in and watch!

Just in case you didn't get enough Catch The Beat with the CTB World Cup, **[the quarterfinals for the CTR 2v2 Indonesia Cup 2015 are taking place this weekend.](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/330939)** This tournament hosted by **[Intel21](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Intel21)**, **[THS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/THS)** and **[Shurelia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Shurelia)** is live over the weekend, so be sure to **[tune in](http://www.twitch.tv/shurelia_)** for some more fruit catching action!

**[The preview for the new forums has been updated.](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums)** Previously many important features were missing from the preview, but now you can do a majority of the things you can do on the current forums, including making posts from it. This is definitely worth checking out as this will most likely be the future of the osu! forums, so be sure to take a look and provide feedback on the new look!

**[The 10'th MBC has been announced!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-06-15-monthly-beatmapping-contest-10-ctb-only)** Staying with the Catch the Beat theme we've had over the last month, the contest will be for mapping a Catch the Beat mapset! If you want to try your hand at the elite mapper title, or are even just interested in seeing how well you perform against some of the well known mappers, you should get started on this! The deadline for submissions is July 1st, so make sure to get your submissions in before then.

**[The osu!news team has created a video showcasing all of the mascots in the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJF2cAs_MrI)**, and even provides a sneak peak at the new mania mascot that has yet to be fully revealed. We have Pippi, Pippidon and Yuzu currently, what do you think the name of the new Mania mascot joining them will be? Hopefully you won't have to wait long to find out!

**[The osu!academy has released another interview with one of the best Catch the Beat players in the United States, Zak.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ7MIshcA-E)** The interview goes over the loss in the CTB World Cup, what got Zak into the game, and various other questions. If you'd like to learn more about this player, this is definitely worth a watch!

**[Peppy has continued to update his blog, keeping players up to date with what he's been working on and what plans are for the future.](https://blog.ppy.sh/)** Some of the main topics covered include the new username change system which was made live this week on the osu!store, progress on OS X compatibility, and further progress on exclusive fullscreen mode in windowed to allow for lower latency play for windowed players.

**[osu!next explained quite a bit about the upcoming changes to osu! and skinning in general](https://next.ppy.sh/post/121902442588/this-weeks-preview-will-answer-questions-that)**, even hinting that we will be able to create elements and even drag them to where we want on the screen. While many of these changes are very high quality and sleek looking, they will not have any effect on performance for people running low end machines, so fear not! The future of osu! keeps looking better and better with each osu!next update.

That's all the news for this week everyone. As always you can send any news you'd like to be represented in the osu!weekly to **[news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh)** and I will do my best to include that information. Now excuse me while I go off and no life FFXIV: Heavensward!
