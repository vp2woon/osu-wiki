Hello everyone! I'll be taking over the osu!weekly again this week while we find someone more permanent to take over this position. With that said, let's get into this.

With the osu!world cup group stage starting this weekend, the teams have been sorted into their groups and the map pool showcase has been released! **[All the information including the group stage schedule is now available on the wiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/OWC_2015)** if you wish to check it out. The first matches will be on Saturday the 7th at 10am UTC and you'll be able to **[watch the live streams via twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/osulive)**

**[cYsmix is back with 3 new tracks. Classic Pursuit, Fright March and Moonlight Sonata.](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/132009865043/mapping-with-rewards-oct-2015)** These 3 songs have the same bounty of $50 store credit, 6 months supporter tag, profile badge and the map being bundled into the client.

After a brief hiatus, **[the osu!talk duo is back with another ama(Ask me Anything) with a guest appearance from Starrodkirby86.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heOfwv3E6BM)** We also go the chance to interview Starrodkirby86 a few days ago, so make sure to keep an eye out for that on youtube in the coming days.

The osu!store has slowly been expanding with shirts, tablets and keyboards, **[but it looks like the next addition to the store will be osu! USB sticks.](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/132211570533/20151030)** While there hasn't been any given release date for these beauties, it does seem like they will be very limited in supply so make sure to keep an eye out for them!

For a long time now, we've been looking at design blogs for osu!next and always wondering, when will it arrive. Well while osu!next is still rather far away, we are seeing small additions to the game client. **[The newest change would be to the new volume UI complete with draggable controls](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/132093709378/20151028)**

Speaking of osu!next, **[flyte has released another interested design drop this week](https://next.ppy.sh/post/132198793238)** showing off different styles for a single area. While it doesn't give us a clear cut view of the design, it is nice to see different concept designs. I should also mention for everyone who missed it, **[jizz.ppy.sh was replaced with new.ppy.sh](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/4619563)**

That's all for this week. If you see anything you think should be included for future issues, please send us an email at **[news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh)** and we'll be sure to have a look! I hope you all had a good weekend and hopefully we'll see you this weekend for the owc!
