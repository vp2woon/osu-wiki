The year 2014 passed and the entire osu!staff would like to wish everyone a happy new year again! Along with that, we opened the traditional Best of 2014 votings.

Go and [choose your favourite maps from the last year](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/bestof2014) so we can compile the top 10 beatmaps of 2014! Keep in mind that we compile the results for each game mode independently. The voting will end as soon as we have received enough votes. Every user is allowed to vote here, but you can only vote for beatmaps you have actually played. The winning mappers will receive a **6 months supporter tag**, so choose wisely!

We hope you will enjoy osu! along with us in 2015 and anticipate the future as much as we do.
