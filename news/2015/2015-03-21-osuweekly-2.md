To start off this week, we have some very good news! osu! over this past week has reached the 6 million mark in user accounts made and we're still growing! How long until we reach 7 million user accounts I wonder?

**[Taiko World Cup: Last Man Standing 2 registrations are underway](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/311318/start=0)**. This tournament is an alternate taiko tournament run by **[Backfire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/263110)** where the rules are similar to that of the official Taiko World Cup, but with a twist in how teams are knocked out. The player who scores the lowest during a match is eliminated until all three players on a team are beaten, winning the other team the match. Be sure to sign up if you are interested in this cup before it's too late!
