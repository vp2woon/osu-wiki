**[The third round of the North American osu!standard Tournament (NAT) is running throughout this week.](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/324720&start=0)** 14 different players remain in the winners bracket, and with many of the players being quite high ranked, it should be an interesting week! While the streaming schedule is decided by when players schedule their matches, most matches are streamed on **[YodaSnipe's twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/yodasnipe/)**, so be sure to tune in!

**[The registration phase for the osu!standard version of Backfire's Last Man Standing tournament series has begun.](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/338022&start=0)** The osu!LMS tournament is similar to the World Cup format, but matches are decided by lowest scoring player being eliminated until one of the teams has no remaining players, deciding the winner. Registrations are open until the 4th of July next Saturday, so make sure to register your team before then if you want to participate!

**[The 34th episode of the osu!academy series was uploaded this week!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opsfa2wR1RY)** This episode going into how to switch between the various release streams of osu!, as well as how to use the help forum and find solutions to common issues before posting there. This episode is good for people who aren't too sure what Cutting Edge and Beta release streams are all about, so be sure to take a look if you're interested in what they are!

As an additional note from the staff at the osu!academy, thanks to all the support from the players of this game, **[the osu!academy youtube channel has hit 1 million views!](/wiki/shared/news/2015-06-27-osuweekly-16/ss+(2015-06-26+at+08.39.01).jpg)** This is a nice milestone for us to have reached, and we couldn't have done so without you, so we would like to thank each and every one of you for helping make osu!academy what it is today!

**[The May Ranking Charts has been made available for players to compete on.](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-06-23-may-2015-monthly-ranking-charts)** This month we have **[DoKito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/537084)**, **[qoot8123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/766371)**, **[Pew](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/597692)** and **[Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092)** as our map selectors with some rather interesting maps, so be sure to get competing before the May Ranking Charts close on the 15th of July! The winners for the April Ranking Charts were also made known, with **[jantan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/887924)**, **[cagalin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2586173)**, **[Dusk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533210)** and **[FusHy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1636180)** all coming out on top for a free month of supporter. Congrats to them!

**[The winners for the Spring 2015 Season have been decided](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-06-23-may-2015-monthly-ranking-charts)**, with **[jantan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/887924)**, **[Ikkun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1059945)**, **[Dusk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533210)** and **[Cryolien](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1626983)** walking away the victors. Unfortunately the long term seasons are being discontinued until the format gets revamped, so these four are the last winners of the long term charts for the time being. Hopefully we will see this revamp in the near future!

Last week the **[store page](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/listing)** had a **[new notice](/wiki/shared/news/2015-06-27-osuweekly-16/ss+(2015-06-26+at+09.21.47).jpg)** put up for all store goers, informing everyone that all shipments of osu!store products are currently halted. **[The cause of this is that the team member who manages this part of osu! is going to be away](https://twitter.com/ppy/status/610407583812202496)**. The store will be shipping out items again on the 15th of July, so be sure to keep that in mind when making orders!

This week on osu!next we got a few design sheets as our preview. These were not the main attraction of this osu!next post however, as **[Flyte did quite a large Q&A session this week, answering many questions that were directed at him over the course of the week.](https://next.ppy.sh/post/122481238753/another-friday-another-preview-but-this-time-i)** There's plenty of things discussed, such as various osu!next topics and some off topic subjects. Be sure to give this a look as there's bound to be something interesting for you if you're curious about osu!next.

**[There was quite a few interesting blogs posted by peppy this week.](https://blog.ppy.sh/)** The first blog post went into **[the infrastructure that makes osu! tick](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/122162152548/20150622-infra)**, giving a general idea with a diagram of how all the servers and such operate together. The second went into different tasks peppy has been working on, as well as **[a personal statement on the growing interest of a well known player's resurgence.](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/122272830393/20150623)** After one mini update blog post, the final post currently up **[goes into detail about the draw hierarchy for osu!](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/122444012473/20150625)**, explaining how sprites and objects are managed on the screen. He also left us with a **[video of a rather broken osu!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuAoQ_BMYxc)**, showing plenty of things that can go wrong while working on a big project like osu!

**[Some very sad news for one of the members of the osu! community was posted on one of osu!'s subreddits.](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/3b83uq/rohulks_sad_news/)** The mother of upcoming Romanian player **[Rohulk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Rohulk)** passed away on June 24th at 2AM. This was following a **[24 hour marathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyvzEptiSpI)** done last month by Rohulk to raise money for his mother who had cancer. Here is a **[small clip of his mother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-0UOgduPww&feature=youtu.be)** from the 24 hour marathon stream. The staff at the osu!news are sorry for your loss Rohulk, and wish the best for you following this saddening event.

That's all the news for this week everyone. As always you can send any news you'd like to be represented in the osu!weekly to **[news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh)** and I will do my best to include that information. Hopefully everyone manages to have a good week!
