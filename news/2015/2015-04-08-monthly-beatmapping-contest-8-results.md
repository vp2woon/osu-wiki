After all the mappers had been working hard away at their mapsets for this slower paced song, the results are in and the winner has been decided. This one was a osu!standard map only, so no taiko, ctb or mania difficulties this time around!

The winner of the contest was [Damnae](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/989377) with a score of 175 points. This is a solid 13 point lead over [Cherry Blossom](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1156742), who scored 162 points from the judges to get second place. Not far behind with only a 4 point difference was a two way tie for third between [Frey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/695678) and [Shadren](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/745494), who both got 158 points.

This map is going to be bundled into the installer for the game along with 6 months of supporter and a mapper title for the winning entry, but for those who would like to play it right now, you can find it [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/671412). Make sure you give it a go, as the map definitely earned its place as a first place score.

For second and third place respectively The entries will receive 3 months of supporter for 2nd place, and 1 month of supporter for both 3rd place entries as it resulted in a tie.

If you want to know the judges comments and the results of the other mappers, you can take a look at them on the [results page](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/contestresults?c=17).

Congratulations to the winning mapper, and we hope that eveyone will enjoy the upcoming taiko themed Monthly Beatmapping Contest #9!
