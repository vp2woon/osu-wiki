The Ranking Charts for August 2015 have just been released and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1508)!
This month [Sieg](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1404615), [Nardoxyribonucleic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/876419), [diao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/500696) and [juankristal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/443656) picked the maps for the Monthly Ranking Charts.

## Ranking Charts Creation

The charts have previously been created by letting four dedicated community members select the most noteworthy maps of this month. We also reward the top beatmap in each category by providing **1 month of supporter status** to the mapper.

### osu!

For osu!, we decided to let **[Sieg](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1404615)** pick their favourite maps.

- **[LIQU@. - Yotogibanashi no Kamikakushi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/236396) by [Kyubey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2195646)**

The Challenge. Solid and natural rhythm and clean mapping alongside with awesome pace. These features are what brings this beatmap to the top of my list. Did I forget to mention another wise choice by mapper - heavy hitsounds? Stress the beat and bring more madness. Don't forget to check "oko's Extra" by Okoratu!

- [Project Grimoire - Caliburne ~Story of the Legendary sword~](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/335665) by [Mikkuri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/317494)

The Beauty. Extra really is a masterpiece here. Good looking beatmap with excellent flow and rhythm that reflecting each single part of the song. Some slider artwork and smart slider velocity changes are included. You will also definitely going to love streams and jumps here. Play, feel, rate 10.

- [Reol - Plus Danshi ver Reol](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/295225) by [jonathanlfj](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/270377)

The Style. This is a perfect example how you can use inspiration from patterns and styles of other mappers and naturally fit this into your own unique style. Great work Jonathan. Fancy song, jumpy difficulty, 180 bpm, what else do you need? Oh, don't forget to download beatmap with "Jizztastic" difficulty but play it with caution!

- [FLOOR LEGENDS -KAC 2012- - KAC 2012 ULTIMATE MEDLEY -HISTORIA SOUND VOLTEX-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/296505) by [Gamu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/611174)

The Consistency. Get on this level, another solid work by Gamu. You will find here a lot of stream placing techniques and 1/4 slider jumps which reflect changes in music in a really smart way, quite a good chance to practice them.

- [M2U - Masquerade](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/124857) by [Melt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/836434)

The Dance. You can meet a lot of big circle size maps on high level but this is another story. Circle size 3 with clean mapping and jumpy patterns fills the whole screen with objects, forcing you to move your cursor all over the place. Good rhythm choices even with 1/4 and 1/6 switches will help you with this.

- [Seiryu - Critical Crystal](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/199535) by [Priti](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2198472)

The E. Priti is well known in community due to his unique Ultra diffs. While you can find really awesome and intense stream action on Ultra difficulty, don't forget to necessarily check another top tier great difficulties here "-Irrvin-'s Extra" by -kevincela- & Irreversible and wa's Extra by wa_.

### Taiko

For Taiko, we asked **[Nardoxyribonucleic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/876419)** about their favourite maps in August 2015.

- **[DJ TOTTO VS TOTTO - Vajra](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/322526) by [qoot8123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/766371)**

A decent full set which is really impressive to me. The mapper makes good use of different pattern constellations to accompany the music appropriately. Spread is well balanced in spite of the relatively large gaps between difficulties. By significantly lowering the note density in calmer sessions, the dense kiais are properly emphasized, thereby making them interesting to play. The complex, yet fitting note streams in Inner Oni and the smooth flow are the highlights of this notable set for the month.

- [Yousei Teikoku - gothic lolita agitator](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/296148) by [ll-oscar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1488736)

Although the mapper is quite new to the community, this debut approved map is surprisingly well-made that may help establish their reputation. Notes are nicely arranged according to vocal pitch and main rhythm, resulting in good coherence with the song. The transition between stanzas is also quite clear and intuitive. If you get some free time on weekends, this 7-minute marathon will definitely be a good choice to spend on.

- [LeaF - Chronostasis](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/193469) by [DakeDekaane](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1425253)

Another appealing instrumental map for the month. Difficulties are made on a hard scale with some difficulty spikes in certain parts, but the overall spread is still reasonable. Inner Oni is considerably hard in terms of note density and pattern complexity. Oni is also quite challenging because of the uncommon 3/4 snapping and the dense arrangement of notes. Are you ready for the stagnation of time (due to retries)?

- [AU - Rochill Tarmination(9 Voice Edit)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/301204) by [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128)

Getting stuck by BPM constraint? This map may probably help you. The mapper maintains a high level of pattern consistency throughout the set with a good spread. Despite the relatively high BPM, the patterns used are quite simple and straightforward. Therefore, this can be a possible practice map for players to get familiar with faster songs. If you want to train the reverse patterns, you may try the abekobe version of Inner Oni as well.

- [CINDERELLA PROJECT - Star!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/336453) by [climbb65588](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/31610)

Renowned for drum mapping, the mapper presents a new piece of work to end their 4-year halt of creating own maps. Patterns are carefully arranged in accordance with the drum sounds and play very well. The use of finishes is a bit special compared with most maps, but they still sound good in gameplay. Difficulties can show a good contrast of note density as song pace changes, thus bringing greater impact to the denser parts.

- [Infected Mushroom - The Pretender](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/130088) by [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766)

Without having a look in editor, most of the players will be surprised owing to this dramatic map. In the first half, it looks like a typical Oni until they notice the nightmare afterwards. Starting from second half, the waves of streams are really challenging that require higher level of skills to overcome. The arrangement of hit-sounds is quite nice that patterns can follow the music in general, while the changes in slider velocity are managed well.

### Catch the Beat

For Catch the Beat, **[diao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/500696)** was the chosen one to declare the winners of the August 2015 beatmaps.

- **[Kajiura Yuki - Sis puella magica!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/318013) by [- Magic Bomb -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3071175)**

I really enjoy playing converts, and one of the things that separates one CtB mapset from the rest isn't the difficulty or even simplicity of the spread but the range of users it appeals to and mod combinations it allows. Want to DT a rain diff or try your hand at platter FL? This is a great place to start. Add that to a beautiful song, high replay value on every difficulty, and the gorgeous hitsounds by - Magic Girl - (coincidence? I think not) and this mapset proves itself to be the clear winner of August for me. I'm looking forward to seeing more great and perhaps difficult sets from MB in the future.

- [Reol - Plus Danshi ver Reol](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/295225) by [jonathanlfj](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/270377)

Oh man, I love Reol. The +O-> diff of this set threw me completely off guard when I first played it, but in a good way. The whole feel of the map is hectic, cluttered in some spots, and flows rather oddly even for a convert. Perhaps because I've played Hollow Wings' notorious map of this song, I find that this diff resembles a lighter version of it. However droplet misses will still seem inevitable so don't relax just yet. Jumps are scattered throughout many of the diffs, which may also unexpectedly break your combo. Every diff of this mapset should present a challenge to players of all skill levels, so try your best!

- [Project Grimoire - Caliburne ~Story of the Legendary sword~](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/335665) by [Mikkuri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/317494)

Finally, a great spread for a unique and catchy song. After listening to it I'm tempted to check out maimai sometime. The song itself starts off peacefully with a pleasant flute, but the build-up and emotion halfway through and towards the end amazes me. Many players will find a certain spot towards the end of the extra diff excruciatingly annoying but I still love it so much.

- [bj.HaLo - Ende](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/188401) by [ZiRoX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/200768)

Here it is, the long awaited 2nd ranked mapset of ZiRoX ft. m1ng, Deif, and taiko people! Seriously though, the rain is fun to play and has an excellent flow. And with a GD overdose from the well known mapper Deif, any hip CtB player would be sure to check this set out. The spread will cater to the abilities of CtB players across every skill level, making it a solid mapset to practice hypers and get exposed to CtB specific mapping. I will say that if you find the rain and overdose from this set enjoyable to check out Fast's rain and Spec's overdose from Crack Traxxxx as I really like that set also from this month, although the mapping styles are different.

- [Halozy - PLAZMA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/315854) by [Hakurei Yoru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3280555)

Another wonderful song by Halozy, this might be my favorite ranked Halozy song by far. Less intense than Genryuu and Kanshou, but a bit more eclectic at times, it even resembles something of a hip-hop beat at some point through the song. Be sure to check out the included lyric SB in the map description as that adds the finishing touches to the feel of the song and map. Map-wise you shouldn't unwind too much as this one features a decent amount of jumps. It is a reflex tester, but definitely not as extreme as +O->. Enjoy!

- [Parov Stelar - Catgroove](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/144955) by [Blue Dragon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)

Blue Dragon is a fairly infamous name in the CtB community for his old ar10 maps, but don't forget that he maps far less intense things too! This song is the definition of chill, smooth, and classy and all of the diffs do an excellent job at complementing the mood. If you've played Charles445's map Dragons or even his Smile of Split you will probably think about those maps when you play the insane diff. These kinds of 3/4 slider heavy maps flow nicely as converts, sometimes creating a hyperdash heavy challenge like Spec's Yoiyami map. This set is less intense with the jump distance, but that does not take away from the challenge of timing smaller non-hyper mini jumps from one slider to the next. Hope you guys have fun with this one.

### osu!mania

For osu!mania, **[juankristal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/443656)** was able to select their personal most noteworthy beatmap from last month.

- **[Ogura Yui - Baby Sweet Berry Love (3R2 Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/335072) by [KawaEE](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4647754)**

With only two 7 Key mapsets this month, I wanted to at least have one for the 7K players and this one is in particular really great! KawaEE bringing to us another sweet berry of love but this time a 3R2 remix in particular. An awesome marathon with good rhythms, a decent hitsounding and overall a really high quality map. The patterns just flow so smoothly during all this 5 minutes of fun and this is why this map gets the #1 spot here. Probably one of the best maps of the year so far. It has everything that a cool mapset needs.

- [Sawai Miku - Colorful. (Asterisk DnB Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/322571) by [Frim4503](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2945775)

Oh god, this decision was really hard to do. This map is awesome as well. A 5K marathon map (really uncommon thing) mapped by Frim. Really nice pattering with a really flow based map, not really hard but challenging enough for those people who want to try new gamemodes or keymodes(just as me). The use of the SV here is incredible well done and it feels very nice, I really enjoy this map and it's sad for me to not put this one on #1 slot because it is really great.

- [Lifetheory - Daisy](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/323163) by [Tidek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/743282)

The top 3 was really hard for me to decide. Daisy is a really awesome map made by Tidek and, in a personal opinion, one of the best structured maps I have seen ranked. A nice amount of long notes combined with well placed doubles following the piano pitch really well and also going for drums. A really good calm song with really good use of the SV(seems like Tidek knows how to handle them). Middle section SV is just awesome and you all should try this beatmap if you haven't. If you don't feel comfortable with hard stuff you can go and try the Clarity difficulty that's also really good for people who are starting with 4k.

- [Drop - Granat](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/281349) by [-Kamikaze-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783)

What can I say about this mapset? As a mapset this is probably the best one of the month. Sadly, it only last for 0:42 seconds but they are worth. Here you have a 5k-6k-8k mapset featuring a lot of the best mappers that the community has at the moment. Zenx, Tidek, Fullerene, Eternailie, Ripazhakgggdkp, Bobbias, rayz141 and of course the mapper itself, -Kamikaze- (hope I am not missing anyone!). Here you basically got whatever you want, all the 3 keymodes having well made diffs for the new players or players who wants to try new gamemodes. Like I said, if only this map was longer this amount of mappers together in one mapset, believe...!

- [Yooh - LegenD.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/298006) by [_FrEsH_ChICkEn_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3984370)

And now we have one of my favourites songs of SDVX and I am talking about _FrEsH_ChICkEn_ and Kuo Kyoka's LegenD.! This is really intense map from SDVX and a really \[12\]\[34\] trill oriented beatmap, one of my favourites patterns too so I really enjoy playing this mapset. Gravity also have some crazy 1/12 burst, streams, long notes, almost everything that a good mapset needs. Even so, I think EXH is the best of the set which I really enjoy playing. If you are looking for cool music and you are a fan of SDVX style then, go play this map and don't waste more time! You don't even need to be a top player since there is a Basic and Advanced difficulty as well.

- [Tatsh - HEAVENLY MOON](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/243654) by [Spy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1217122)

And for the last map of this month we have Heavenly Moon by Spy. A really good mapset selected for the MWC 2015 Round of 16 map pool. Mentioning that last thing, you should be able to notice the quality of the map without many explanations. Overall a good structured map and one of the best maps that Spy made. Also Mashiro made a diff for this mapset challenging the new players to an advanced difficult. Expect some double trills for this map and some fun SV changes!

**The August 2015 ranking charts will end on the 15th October 2015**. For the next month, we will elect new community members to pick their favourite beatmaps, so stay tuned!
