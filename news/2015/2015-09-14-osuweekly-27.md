**[The Semifinals have concluded for the 2015 4K Mania World Cup!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/345431)** The United Kingdom and the United States both advanced into the finals of the winners bracket, sending Japan and China both down to the loser's bracket. For the loser's bracket matches this week we had South Korea, Canada, France and Argentina get knocked out during Saturday's matches, with the Philippines and Indonesia following suit on Sunday, only Malaysia and Brazil advancing through the loser's bracket. This upcoming weekend we will be hosting the last set of matches for both the winner's and loser's bracket, with the winning team from each bracket moving on to the Grand Finals two weeks from now. **[Be sure to be there this weekend to watch the livestream of the event](http://www.twitch.tv/osulive)** as we approach the end of this exciting world cup! **[Scheduling and bracket information can be found on the wiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/MWC_4K_2015)**, so take a look at that if you want to know just when your favourite team is playing. For those who missed the matches this weekend, you can find the VOD's on twitch (or on **[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC04QGgpwL5b53HbMCi4TB7A/videos)** when they are uploaded). My personal recommendations for matches to watch are Japan vs. the United States and Malaysia vs. the Philippines!

**[Registrations for the TWC: Last Man Standing - Single Player Edition tournament are now open!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/366482)** This taiko tournament hosted by **[Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Nwolf)** and **[Dainesl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Dainesl)** is similar to that of previous Last Man Standing tournaments, taking on a double elimination format with the main twist being that individual players are given 2-3 lives in a 3-6 player FFA room where the lowest score loses a life until only one player has lives remaining. Registrations for this tournament close on September 5th, with the tournament starting October 3rd. If you're interested in this, be sure to register before it's too late!

**[After a month hiatus, applications for Beatmap Nominator Group are now open!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1N6RJVVglTU2k8DMiEtmQwlAfsaU7pJAdyW_u3U5bSXM/closedform)** If you have been a contributing, helpful modder and want to be part of this team, be sure to check this out and apply! You can also recommend a modder with this form, so if you know someone who you feel should be part of this team, you can fill this form out for them as well. Applications close September 20th, so be sure to get your applications in before then!

**[Results of the French Beatmapping Contest 2015 Edition have been made available!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/4504233)** In this mapping contest hosted by **[Kurai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/77089)**, all modes were available for mapping, with some modes getting more submissions than others. For osu!standard there was 10 entrants, **[Secretpipe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Secretpipe)** taking 1st place with 118 points out of 150. In taiko there was 6 entrants, **[Nofool](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Nofool)** taking 1st place with 62 points out of 80. Catch the Beat had a single entry from **[rezoons](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/rezoons)**, so he took 1st by default, and lastly osu!mania had 2 entrants, with **[Julie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Julie)** taking 1st place with a score of 32 out of 40. If you'd like to try out the different maps created for this contest, **[you can find the .osz here](https://puu.sh/kbadX/41b4f925e2.osz)** containing every entry!

Good news for skinners! **[This week in peppy's blog posts there was a new tool added to debug](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/128638149943/20150908)** that will eventually be made available to players across the game, **[real time reloading of sprites!](https://puu.sh/k3TQ6/dbb2d7ac2e.mp4)** There's currently no news as to when this will be available for the regular user, so keep an eye out for this!

On top of several changes being made to the game by the developer team to **[tighten user security](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/128778921328/20150910)**, making **[large behind the scenes changes](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/128851355633/20150911)** and more, cutting edge has been getting some pretty snazzy new additions, one of which is the new osu! theme (click the circles!) being added to cutting edge! If any of you haven't made the switch to cutting edge yet, this is most certainly the time to do it with all the security improvements and higher optimization than stable. Go check it out if you haven't already!

As if the news coming from peppy's blog isn't enough for people to get hyped about for osu!next, the **[osu!next](https://next.ppy.sh/)** blog has also released some new teasers that are sure to make some skinners extremely happy. The images posted on friday give us a **[sneak peek](https://next.ppy.sh/post/128834891088/its-friday-time-for-another-osunext-sneak-peek)** into what appears to be an **[official website skinning database](/wiki/shared/news/2015-09-14-osuweekly-27/tumblr_nui6uwDENh1tleiqgo1_1280.jpg)** where players can share and update their skins with the community easier than ever, **[complete with version history!](/wiki/shared/news/2015-09-14-osuweekly-27/tumblr_nui6uwDENh1tleiqgo5_1280.jpg)** This will be a vast improvement over the current system where users upload their skins to third party websites and share them through the forum, so you guys should definitely be excited for this!

Have you ever played Project DIVA before? I personally hadn't had the chance to experience it, until recently when user **[IamBaum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3078914)** created an **[osu! version of Project DIVA using the storyboard called osu!DIVA!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/365396&start=0)** While this isn't an official game mode for osu!, it plays quite well and even has a tool supplied by the creator to allow the community to make their own osu!DIVA maps with ease! Just take a look at the **[video showcasing this mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhDttpta484)** and it becomes very apparent how much effort was put into this.

By now, many players are aware that there are multiple different input methods used to play osu!. From tablets, mice, keyboards, and.... telegraph keys? That's right! User **[DrLlama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5407654)** has **[connected a telegraph key dating back to the early 1900s through USB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Gr0bivrs1U)** and has shown that even old input methods can work given the right setup! While it may not be the most efficient way to play, it certainly is cool!

That's all for this week everyone! As always you can send any news you'd like to be represented in the osu!weekly to **[news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh)** and I will do my best to include that information. Hope to see you all at the finals for the 4K Mania World Cup!
