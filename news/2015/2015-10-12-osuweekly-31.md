Hey everyone, Tasha here for another edition of osu!weekly! First off I'd like to thank deadbeat for covering for me last week to keep news coverage coming to everyone on the usual weekly basis. That said, there's a lot of tournament stuff to cover this week, so let's not delay any longer!

**[The new osu! World Cup scoring system is now available on cutting edge!](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/130830644563/20150910)** Currently only usable in multiplayer with the "Score V2" win condition dropdown, this system has a max score of 1,000,000 plus any spinner bonus, with 70% of the score being combo based and 30% being accuracy based. These values may end up changing over time and are not finalized. Another large change is that with this scoring system, sliders now have accuracy judgement on the initial hit. No longer can players hit sliders early or late and still achieve a 300, they must be timed just like any other note, making accuracy significantly harder in slider heavy maps. Scores using this new score system are not submitted through online ranking, so be aware of this when testing!

**[With the 4K Mania World Cup having completed](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-10-07-osumania-4k-world-cup-2015-results)**, we're closing up with **[all matches from the finals and grand finals being uploaded to the osu!live youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC04QGgpwL5b53HbMCi4TB7A)**. There's also a **[recap of the semifinals and finals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLIU9k2j1e0)** available for those who may want a quick rundown of what happened during these particular MWC stages, so be sure to check that out if you missed the matches!

**[Groups and schedules are now available for the upcoming osu!mania International Tournament 2015, also known as MIT2015](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/349167)**. This is a multi key, country based double elimination tournament run by **[Ingen1334](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3439275)** with 4K, 5K, 6K, 7K and 8K all having an equal part in the map pool. The first set of matches will be taking place on the 17th and 18th of October, so be sure to check out which countries and players are taking place that you'd like to support so that you can cheer for them when the matches are streamed on their **[twitch channel!](http://www.twitch.tv/ingen1334)**

**[On the osu! side of things, the Spring osu! Aus/NZ Tournament has its first round coming up this weekend!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/365964)** Run by **[EmeraldStar82](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3772135)**, this is a small double elimination standard game mode tournament that consists of players from Australia and New Zealand that are ranked 25,000 to 45,000, with 8 players having registered. The **[bracket](https://www.toornament.com/tournaments/560e1e59150ba0333f8b456e/custom)** and **[stream](http://www.twitch.tv/emeraldstar82)** links are already available with the schedule for the tournament itself being in the opening post. If you're interested in small middle tier tournaments this should be a great watch!

**[Results for the Pending Cup #3 mapping contest were made public!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/373843)** This chinese mapping contest run by **[popner](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/popner)** and **[IamKwaN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/IamKwaN)** had three different songs being judged, with "**[权御天下 (Quan Yu Tian Xia)](https://mega.nz/#!TYJnXD4J!30YKDAdGoyiOno8SIlv3Rci4iMbunS1U2meJj1YnFvk)**", "**[Imprinting](https://mega.nz/#!6JAT3SbY!cPxr1tmU5fQwg42EymuDPwrPDuN2k2AAIubmxZCVxNU)**" and "**[YELLOW SPLASH!!](https://mega.nz/#!XQZ0QayB!rn5kBbzjsHf6h73Ia3aktgJgXubKAmAf7Ua-mrqj5lA)**" being the songs of choice. There was also two divisions for entry, with the "normal" division being people who have had a map ranked or qualified before, and the "novice" division for people who have never had a map ranked or qualified, giving everyone a fair shot of going for a prize. **[Regraz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Regraz)** and **[Syameimaru-Aya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Syameimaru-Aya)** winning the Normal and Novice divisions for "权御天下 (Quan Yu Tian Xia)", **[yf_bmp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/yf_bmp)** and **[Syameimaru-Aya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Syameimaru-Aya)** winning their respective divisions for "Imprinting", and finally **[fanzhen0019](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/fanzhen0019)** and **[Syameimaru-Aya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Syameimaru-Aya)** winning in their divisions on "YELLOW SPLASH!!". Be sure to check out the **[Score Summary](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1o6L5Skq)**, as well as the **[Detailed Score and Comments](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1o6tL5Jc)** to see how these results were determined! All of the participants maps are available in packages linked above with each song name, so take a look if you want to see some impressive maps!

With the OWC drawing closer and closer, **[osu!talk went into discussion about the upcoming world cup as well as a close up discussion of the now past 4K Mania World Cup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwIPweKIH-Y)**. There was a few community issues discussed, such as individual registration and new score system, as well as predictions to which teams will perform the best this upcoming OWC. If you have an hour to set aside and listen, I'd definitely recommend it!

On the development side of things, there are a few different things being worked on. First things first, **[there are new bounties available on osu!web!](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/labels/bounty)** Being able to complete any of these bounties gives a fairly good reward, so it's worth it for community developers to take a look at them! Mac users who are having issues running osu! natively on OS X are going to have to wait a bit longer with the recent **[El Capitan release currently not working through Wine. This has been acknowledged and because of it, native OS X support is being worked on](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/130770448208/20151008)**, so please be patient and hopefully in a few weeks there should be a native solution for this! Last but not least, there has been more work on the **[new forums](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums)**, with **[profile additions such as recent activity and kudosu being added, as well as font changes to the forum itself to help improve forum readability](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/130692042273/20151007)**.

That's all for this week everyone! As always you can send any news you'd like to be represented in the osu!weekly to **[news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh)** and we'll do our best to include that information. I'd like to end saying I'm glad to be back and hope everyone has an awesome weekend, especially with all the fun tournament stuff coming up this weekend!
