With a slight delay due to some technical difficulties, the Ranking Charts for May 2015 have just been released and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1505)!

Along with that, we concluded the Spring Season of the [Ranking Charts long-term leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rgaKVJj_MDo0PwGrGXbKRVzjE9fhOUb4XZXRsOjTaoQ/pubhtml)! This month [DoKito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/537084), [qoot8123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/766371), [Pew](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/597692) and [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092) picked the maps for the Monthly Ranking Charts.

## Spring 2015 Season is over!

Congratulations to the winners of the Ranking Charts Spring Season! [jantan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/887924) will be rewarded with **3 months of supporter status** and the user title **Charts Champion** for 3 months. For the first time, [Dusk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533210) was able to defend their titles twice! This tremendous achievement grants them the unique user title **Charts Legend** and a boosted prize of **6 months of supporter status** instead! This is the biggest prize we have available in this competition! Congratulations!

- **osu!mania:** [Cryolien](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1626983) (Score: 65)

We would like to thank everyone for participating on the seasonal competition we had so far. Unfortunately, we will have to halt this competition and will not open a new long-term seasonal competition with this Ranking Charts. As the current system requires further improvement, we considered it as the best to conclude the Ranking Charts long-term ladderboards with the end of the Spring 2015 season and may open them up whenever we were able to revamp the system we had so far here.

## Ranking Charts Creation

The charts have previously been created by letting four dedicated community members select the most noteworthy maps of this month. We also reward the top beatmap in each category by providing **1 month of supporter status** to the mapper.

### osu!

For osu!, we decided to let **[DoKito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/537084)** pick their favourite maps.

- **[JO*STARS ~TOMMY, Coda, JIN~ - JoJo Sono Chi no Kioku~end of THE WORLD~](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/269969) by [Atsuro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2279351)**

You have to ORA at least once in your life. This one is a rather short one, but that makes you get to the ORA part faster. The patterns in this map look and play amazingly well, but the end adds the final touch to it. The end is what makes this map unique and rememberable. It fits so well to the song, is challenging and very much fun. I'm telling you!

- [Katarzyna Laska - No Ordinary Girl](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/198978) by [Tidek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/743282)

You have to be good to full-combo this with DoubleTime. After a few retrys the song will give you nightmares. But besides that it is a great map and got some really challenging jumps. There isn't much to say about this map, since it is a short one, but it is good for improving your aim.

- [Yooh - Ice Angel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/297933) by [ktgster](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/53378)

If you like long streams and small circles, this map is perfect for you. This map is especially fun because of its changing stream spacing and decent flow. You really have to have a good aiming/movement to play this and of course the ability to stream 168 consistently. If you are one of the not-so-good streamers, this might also be a good practice map for your stamina and your movement. Just try the map out yourself. I - for my share - really liked this map.

- [Hitori Tori - perthed again (yambabom remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/268693) by [Asphyxia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1715720)

Zapy is one of these graveyard mappers. This doesn't make his maps bad though. You can still find some of his guest difficulties in ranked mapsets. He is definitely one of my favourite mappers and this is only one of his masterpieces. The map begins relatively easy, but increases in difficulty as it progresses. Perthed again is a rather jumpy map, so if you aren't used to huge screenjumps, you better pass on this one. Oh and did I mention that one of the other Extras is from Asphyxia? So if you want to challenge yourself with 180BPM screenjumps, this is the map you are searching for.

- [Morimori Atsushi - PUPA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/224164) by [Cherry Blossom](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1156742)

Cherry Blossom... the master of streams and 1/4 sliderjumps. This is not even his best map, but still amazingly good. Long, fast streams combined with nice flowing sliderjumps is what makes this map what it is. Short map, short comment.

- [RedMuffleR - Rubeus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/249703) by [Smoothie World](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1855540)

Never heard of the mapper "Smoothie World". It looks like this is his first ranked map, but it looks like we will see more of him in the future. This map is a nice mix of 200BPM streams and jumps, which follow the music very well. Anyways. I am running out of ideas what to write, so just play the map yourself and enjoy!

### Taiko

For Taiko, we asked **[qoot8123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/766371)** about their favourite maps in May 2015.

- **[Weebos Zunder feat. el nino de las salchipapas - Salchipapa](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/299103) by [Hanjamon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1703330)**

The only Spanish this month, when I listen to the song, I just have a question "how to map taiko map on this song"? but after I play the map, I was very surprised that it is mapped perfectly. He gives very solid structure by don, and he use kat to emphasize some significant sounds like clap, cymbal...etc. That makes the hitsounds very clear.
Although the song is not popular, I must say this map is very good and deserve to be a part of this chart!

- [Onocchi, Xenon - Suigetsu Kyouka Koubou Issen](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/294471) by [lolcubes](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/578401)

Classic drum-base map by lolcubes, he follow the drum very clearly. There is no hard pattern, but still let me feel exciting to play, it might be thanks to very nicely arrangement of breaks.
Maybe you might be confused why I didn't choose this map for the first place, but the reason is that this song has clear drum sounds itself, so it is more easier to map compared with Salchipapa. It is a perfect map, but I'm not as surprised as I am about Salchipapa.

- [EastNewSound - Hana wa Gensou no Hate Ni](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/290314) by [\_Gezo\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/481582)

The easiest pick in this chart. The map also mapped very clean. Oni for example: The usage of it is very nice by following the guitar on first part, and then the music combined more instrument like bass drum, and he use don to follow the drum beat, that's pretty solid. And I really like the usage of big notes on kiai. It reflects the vocal pretty well!

- [Camellia - Proluvies](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/283815) by [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766)

My favorite song on this chart. And the map also mapped very diligently. He used some SV and volume change to reflect the song better. The usage of big notes is also pretty good to emphasize the accent.

- [sasakure.UK feat. Hatsune Miku - SeventH-HeaveN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/275907) by [tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767)

Pretty solid mapset made by tasuke912, and it is good to see there is a different, new mapping style among ranked maps. The break, doublet's usage are in a different way. Although the mapset doesn't have any impressive pattern, it is still worth to chart with special style of mapset.

- [u's - No brand girls (TV Size)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/88572) by [JUDYDANNY](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1165475)

A classic taiko map for TV size song which is mapped by JUDYDANNY. He follows the snare pretty solid by using kat. And he is also using big don / kat to emphsize the vocal's accent. That's very common way to map this kind of song, but it is still very good, so I choose this mapset for this chart.

### Catch the Beat

For Catch the Beat, **[Pew](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/597692)** was the chosen one to declare the winners of the May 2015 beatmaps.

- **[JerryTerry - U.N. Owen Was Yee?](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/263191) by [Zak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375955)**

This map is the best map this month for Catch the Beat players, the reasoning is that firstly, its the only full spread map this month consisting with all the difficulties (cup-overdose). Pattern wise it consist of a mixture of streams, hyper dashes, and jumps for higher difficulties and simple jumps for easier difficulty, so this gives a very smooth progression in learning many types of patterns in Catch the Beat by this beatmap alone.

- [kamome sano - dawn(ginkiha hardcore remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/185766) by [wendao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1843939)

This is one of the cleanest convert in Catch the Beat, the pattern might be simplistic but the flow and the jumps are so good that they could be used for Catch the Beat maps. This spread is very good for people that wants to learn jumps as it contains quite a lot of timed jumps. Because of this timed jumps it is also challenging for seasoned veterans.

- [Camellia - Proluvies](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/283815) by [Priti](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2198472)

This map has very fun streams with one of the best hitsounds. The pattern of the hitsounds completely matches with the streams and follows the music very well, making it quite useful for mod players. It has a very large spread with many easy difficulty that most beginners can do, even with mods.

- [Katarzyna Laska - No Ordinary Girl](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/198978) by [WujekGrzyb](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/258289)

This one is a fan favourite by the Catch the Beat difficulty, focusing primarily on the rain, its a very clean and well done, the hybrid use of the normal jumps and hypderdash jumps fits perfectly well with the songs emphasized points.

- [Yumi Haruna - Amai Hanazono(Game Version)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/269177) by [Deceitful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1396447)

Another well done Catch the Beat difficulty, this one, the hypderdash flows very well and the hitsounds is very nicely done, quite soothing and fits perfectly with the music. this is the most relaxing of the 6 maps i chosen, making a very good contrast with the other faster maps.

- [A.SAKA - Nanatsu Issenzakura](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/214138) by [Hollow Wings](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/416662)

This is a very interesting map ranked this month, in the convert form it has a very new and fresh style of complex jumps and patterning. what more is that difficulty such as another focuses on timed jumps and expert with hyperdashes makes it a good map for harder players. but the easier difficulty is still very enjoyable for new players and mod players, this is due to the high quality hitsounds and simpler patterns that newer players would enjoy

### osu!mania

For osu!mania, **[Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092)** was able to select their personal most noteworthy beatmap from last month.

- **[Halozy - Kanshou no Matenrou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/251365) by [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717)**

Marathon maps can be both fun and challenging, especially when they're mapped well, but Feerum's map really takes the cake. This map brings us a variety of patterns that completely made the map very enjoyable such as streams, chordstreams and 1/8 rolls. I like how the map acts like an emotional rollercoaster, going from a relaxed to a strong feeling for a good number of times in the song, ending with fierce chordstreams followed by calm patterns. The hitsounds were also icing on the cake as they compliment the tranquil atmosphere in some parts of the song really well. Personally, this map deserves the #1 spot for osu!mania's May 2015 charts, and for those who haven't played this yet, I definitely recommend you to play this.

- [Yooh - FIRE FIRE -DARK BLAZE REMIX-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/242368) by [Shinzo-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4720038)

A song like this is accompanied very well with Shinzo-'s mapping style. Along with ArcherLove's INFINITE difficulty, this mapset brings out its great qualities as it contains complex patterns that can be really fun for the fingers. The GRAVITY difficulty in this mapset has chordstreams, tricky long note patterns, and 1/12 bursts that are quite difficult to hit. As a player who likes challenging maps, it's great to see a map such as this enter the ranked mappool. With 5 difficulties ranging from 2 stars to 5.5 stars, this is quite a challenging mapset but also a fun one for many players alike.

- [Chroma - Black Emperor](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/292936) by [Ichigaki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2403444)

Another great mapset from the same person that mapped one of the hardest 4K mapsets, this time with a song that's intense with feeling. The shifting musical phrases and the mildly shifting BPM can make a mapset potentially unique to its own, and Ichigaki mapped it excellently. This mapping style doesn't appear in a lot of maps, but it's structure flows really well for this song. The long note patterns, 1/4 jacks, 1/8 rolls and semi-heavy streams really capture the fierce feeling of the song. This is a mapset that is easily one of the most notable in the charts of May 2015 as it really stands out from other mapsets.

- [Halozy - Koi no Serenade](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/308944) by [[17VA]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1895984)

A catchy song wonderfully mapped by 17VA. His style emphasizes on heavy long note usage, but the way the patterns are arranged look aesthetically pleasing. They are also quite fun to play for many players as it has streams and manageable 1/4 jacks added in the mix of long notes. Along with being a good long note practice map, this map is unique with its use of long notes while covering the relaxing feeling of the song.

- [senya - Utakata, Ai no Mahoroba](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/186159) by [Kyousuke-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2616570)

Kyousuke- brings out 8 difficulties in a mapset featuring the ever-popular 4K keymode and the not-so-often-seen 5K keymode. The mapset has a nice spread, covering new players and advanced players, and as you work your way up to higher difficulties, more and more intricate patterns are introduced in the song. The storyboard also adds a nice touch to the mapset, reflecting the song's pace very well. Let's not forget that there are a total 6 people who worked on this mapset, each with their own interpretation of the song. Great job to everyone involved in the mapset!

- [Hana - Kuukirikigaku Shoujo to Shounen no Uta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/251951) by [[AyanoTatemaya]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2760619)

\[AyanoTatemaya\] brings us another mapset that contains both 4K and 7K keymodes, adding up to 6 difficulties in total. The difficulty spread is great, covering for a wide variety of players. The patterns are done well and are very enjoyable, and the mix of long notes and regular notes provide a little bit of challenge as you work up through the difficulties. Even then, the mapset's structure and the song go along with each other very well, and this is a mapset that many people would enjoy.

**The May 2015 ranking charts will end on the 15th July 2015**. For the next month, we will elect new community members to pick their favourite beatmaps, so stay tuned!
