We just opened the submissions for the 10th Monthly Beatmapping Contest  - for the first time only for the Catch the Beat game mode and with the awesome song "Hylian Lemon - Foresight Is for Losers".

This is the first stand-alone beatmapping contest for Catch the Beat only! We anticipated this moment for a long time and hope that you like the song choice as much as we do.

Moving from the fast-paced and catchy music of Lapfoxx Track, we are moving over to a great 8-bit styled remix from The Legend of Zelda. Various speed changes and varying sections offer a lot of opportunity to show off how you can make the fruits rain. Listen to it below:

- 6 months of supporter for you or a friend!
- 'Elite Mapper' forum title

## What are the rules?

- You must map 4 difficulties in an appropriate spread - either ENHI (easy, normal, hard and insane) or NHIX (normal, hard, insane, expert).
- Collaboration is allowed, but will only be registered under the name of the person who submitted the beatmap. Prizes for a winning mapset will only be given to the uploader.
- Difficulty names must only be the name of the respective difficulty, and nothing else. No ztrot's Hard or anything comparable.
- Maps submitted to the contest must not be submitted to the BSS until the contest has concluded.
