Greetings All. I want to say thank you to everyone that gave feedback on the previous weekly, and for all your encouraging words as I stepped into this role. Some big stuff going on this week, let us get to it.

The osu!World cup is still underway; with the quarter finals completed! A total of 8 matches were fought in the quarter finals, four matches in the winners and losers bracket. Teams that lost in the winner brackets, are still given a second chance. But, the ones that lost in the losers brackets get knocked out of the tournament. [Check out the official owc wiki page for more info!](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Osu!_World_Cup_2015)

[Changes to the new forums are here. With an all new revamp](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/133524244723/20151119) You can now customize your threads with topic covers! (only available in the new forums). Replying has also been made easier with the new snapping editor. Lastly, osu!web has a wide view to accompany those with 21:9 monitors.

A big surprise awaits for whichever team wins the OWC. [As peppy has announced some amazing merchandise made just for the OWC winners.](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/133524244723/20151119) About merchandise on the osu!store, osu! Tablet amounts are low. The new osu!keyboard is still on sale with efforts to get OS X support back.

[Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) has recently been moved to rank #1 in osu!standard mode, beating [hvick225](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/50265), the reigning #1 player in osu! standard. A mere 3 pp difference, Rafis has 10,876 pp compared to hvick225, who has 10,873 pp.

I'd like to show you all [osu!celebrity](http://www.twitch.tv/osucelebrity), a twitch and osu! bot created by [ReesesPuffs](https://www.youtube.com/c/ReeseWasHereChannel), [Redback](https://rdbk.tv/) and [Tillerino](https://github.com/Tillerino/Tillerinobot/wiki/Contact). The bot can spectate players in-game and live stream it for you. It has a variety of commands that allow players to dictate the specific player speculated. The bot is currently at beta, but still has functionality.

To maintain security, [a new verification system will be added soon](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/133395614668/20151117). Users now need to verify by email when doing certain actions to their account. Email verification will also be included in the game client, although it is still in the works.

Two users joined the staff. Say hello to [juankristal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/juankristal) and [Zak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Zak), both added into the Global Moderation Team (GMT). Global Moderator [drum drum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4435526) has been moved to the osu! Alumni.

That's a wrap for this week. As usual, you are free to send an email to **[news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh)** for any suggestions on future news; we'll try our best to include it. Have a fantastic week!

â€”Tari
