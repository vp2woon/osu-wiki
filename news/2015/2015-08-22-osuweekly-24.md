On monday, **[osu!academy uploaded a new osu!talk video talking about osu!idol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwtlGM1GpWM)** where previous judges of the osu!idol sat and talked a bit about the history of osu!idol and how it was revived. For all you talented singers out there, you may find this discussion interesting as it also goes over some rules for the currently running osu!idol.

**[The 11th Monthly Beatmapping Contest is coming up soon with the staff of the event searching for players to judge the next set of submissions](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/359694)**. This mapping contest will be osu!mania specific, just in time for the 4k Mania World Cup.Please keep in mind before applying that this event takes a lot of your time as a judge, so don't apply if you don't think you'll have the time!

**[The Chat Moderator group has now been merged with the Global Moderation Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/4435972)**.
